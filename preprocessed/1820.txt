 Lord Castlereagh  presented the following Message from the King: R. 1597 R.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he should move that it be taken into consideration tomorrow. He thought it necessary that members should have a day to consider one part of it, but he hoped the House would feel that there ought to be no delay in replying to another part—he meant that which referred to the death of his late majesty. In rising to propose an address of condolence to his majesty, the House would feel that it was not necessary or desirable for him to go into lengthened details; and he hoped that, from the few observations which he had to make nothing would arise to prevent their coming to an unanimous decision on the present melancholy occasion. They would, he was persuaded, all join in the same sentiments of affliction and reverence for the loss of their late beloved monarch. Whatever might be the opinions respecting the events of the late reign, and of the administration of government under his present majesty, there could, he was certain, be no difference as to this point—that under the illustrious House of Brunswick this country had enjoyed a greater share of happiness and glory than had fallen to the lot of any other nation on the face of the globe. The House, he was sure, were anxious to testify their deep affliction at the loss of a monarch, who, in the course of a long reign, during periods of great trial, had, by his mild and amiable qualities, secured the love and esteem of the nation. Indeed, the veneration in which our late beloved monarch was held, and the general attachment to him by all ranks and

 Mr. Tierney  said, that no man could be more sensible than himself of the virtues of their late revered and lamented sovereign—virtues too numerous to be then detailed Nor could any man be more sincere than himself in congratulating his present majesty on his accession. No man could feel a greater personal respect for his majesty than himself. No man could be more earnest in his hopes that his majesty's reign might be long and prosperous. No man could exceed him in zealous wishes that that reign might be productive of equal honour and advantage to his majesty and to the country. Undoubtedly there was one expression in the address which he thought had better have been omitted. He adverted to that passage which spoke of "the experience of the past." On all the past he wished to turn his back. He wished to bury it in oblivion. A new reign was commencing, and he most anxiously hoped that his majesty would adopt such measures—that his ministers would advise such measures, as would conduce to his majesty's own character, honour, and dignity, and to the general benefit of the country. nem. con. nem. con.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that in rising to move an Address to his Majesty, it might be for the convenience of the House to state, what course it was the intention of ministers to propose. It was well known, that although before the late recess various bills had been agreed to, applicable to the then state of the country, the great mass of the public busi-
 1605 1606
 Lord Castlereagh  assured the right hon. gentleman, that he had no other purpose in the propositions which he had submitted to the House, than that which he had distinctly avowed. It did not appear to his majesty's government, that the various topics to which he had alluded, could be so conveniently discussed by the present as by a new parliament. It must quiet any constitutional jealousy on the subject to observe, that the vote which his right
 1609
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  agreed, that the Crown was at this moment without any other revenue than that portion of the hereditary revenue which belonged to the civil list, amounting to between 500,000 l. l.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that every pains would be taken to prevent any inconvenience arising in the quarter alluded to, from the dissolution of parliament.
 Mr. Canning  said, he could assure the House, that the civil list would be arranged with every view to economy, and a proper attention to the dignity of the Crown. The hon. and learned member had taken a constitutional objection to the discussion of the dissolution of parliament, observing, that nothing of the kind had been previously done.—That hon. member ought to recollect, that parliament had on a former occasion presented an Address, praying that the Crown might not interfere with its operations by dissolution. What was to prevent the House from now entertaining such a question he was yet to learn. It was argued also, that a prorogation was the old wholesome law of the constitution. But the law was the other way. The old practice was, that parliament died immediately on the demise of the Crown; and it was by recent enactments that a sort of period of grace was extended, and parliament allowed to sit six months after such demise, the power still remaining in the king to dissolve at pleasure. This enactment was made in the reign of king William, and the specific ground for it was, that at that time there was a disputed succession, and it would have been inconvenient that parliament should be instantaneously separated. This act was made permanent in the reign of queen Anne, when a foreign succession was again contemplated. It was an act which was analogous to, and by no means opposed to the spirit of
 1612
 Mr. Macdonald  said, it was singular, that though ministers confessed that there was a series of precedents before them, they should think it necessary to deviate from them without assigning a reason for their conduct. It was admitted that all the kings of England since the Revolution, had felt it necessary to throw themselves upon parliament for a suitable provision to support their dignity, nor was there any instance where the people did not ratify and approve of the conduct of their representatives on such occasions. The present was the first time that the civil list was not noticed in the message from the Crown. Was it that the present parliament, which had gone so far with government, were not to be trusted? or was it that the loyal and generous people of this country would feel displeased at making a suitable provision for the Crown? It was said that economy would be looked to in providing for the civil list; but it was known how little value was to be set upon such statements. The impression upon his mind was, that there was something in agitation, which, if brought forward now, would not bear the test of a general election.
 Lord Castlereagh  agreed in the principle of the bill, but suggested that it was likely, in the event of the bill going to the Lords, they would call for the information upon which the Commons had acted.
 Mr. Wynn  was of opinion, that Barnstaple ought to be included in this bill. Ample evidence had been given at the bar, of the existence of bribery in that borough, and the other House was proceeding upon a similar inquiry, when their proceedings were put an end to by the prorogation of parliament. No one could deny the plenitude of the authority of parliament, on this as on other subjects. But it would certainly embarrass the proceedings if members were returned
 1614
 Lord J. Russell  said, that he had no objection to include Barnstaple in the bill.
 Lord John Russell  said, that in bringing forward his motion with regard to those boroughs in which bribery had
 1613
 Mr. Tierney , declared, that the whole of the proceeding was the most extraordinary he had ever heard of. He did not believe that there had ever been an accession to the Crown without some communication to parliament of a nature very different from that which had been made in the present instance. It had always been usual to say something of the feelings of the now monarch, and of the course of policy which it was his intention to pursue. In the present case, the House had only been drily told, that his majesty's government found it convenient to send them about their business as soon as possible. It was true, it might be said, that on former occasions of the demise of the Crown, parliament was in a state of prorogation; and that there was, therefore, greater scope for observations of the nature to which he alluded, in the speech from the Throne, on its assembling. But on such an occasion as the present, there would have been no irregularity in summoning the House of Commons to attend in the other House of Parliament, for the purpose of hearing the royal sentiments.
 1607 1608
 Mr. Brougham  could not help expressing his surprise at the extraordinary nature of the proceedings adopted by ministers. With respect to the subject alluded to by the hon. member who had just sat down, it was not then his intention to offer a word upon it. This was the first message which so precisely and so specifically pointed out the dissolution of parliament. Whenever parliament interfered with the prerogative of the Crown, they were told by ministers that they were not competent to entertain the subject of the termination of their existence as a body—that the Crown alone was to decide upon it. Without meaning to deny the right of the people to control ministers in the advice which they gave the Crown as to the exercise of its prerogative, he could not help noticing the strange position in which parliament was placed. They were called upon to give an opinion whether the proposed dissolution was a well advised measure or not. Thus called upon, it was no wonder that they should enter upon the discussion. For himself he was as little averse to an immediate dissolution of parliament as the noble lord, or any of his colleagues could be. He had, however, one remark to make upon this advice given to the Crown; he presumed that ministers had maturely weighed the inconvenience to which the country would be put by having the election come on in the middle of the assizes. On the former dissolution of parliament the term was postponed, but it could not be done in the present instance. The next point to which he should refer, was more material. He could not help congratulating the House upon the admission which had been, though slowly, wrung from ministers. Not long since they were told, that so great was the alarm in the public mind —so inherent was vice in the country— so great was the number of discontented and designing persons, who were plotting the subversion of the constitution—that it was found necessary to call upon parliament to pass the most harsh and restrictive measures, in order to put down the turbulence of the county. But now the fact was, that one of these restrictive measures expired with the parliament, and as ministers did not exercise their discretion in proposing its renewal, it showed that the necessity for it had ceased, or else they were about to plunge the country into a situation which not many weeks since was said to be incon-

 Lord Jocelyn  reported the King's Answer to the Address, as follows; R. 1615 R."
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he thought the answer which he had given the hon. gentleman on a former evening would have been deemed quite satisfactory. If the hon. gentleman had waited for the motion which the chancellor of the exchequer proposed to submit, he would have seen that no distinct provision was to be voted for the king, any more than for the high personage to whom he had alluded, but that a sum was to be voted from the consolidated fund, out of which it was intended to make provision for that high personage, as well as for the general purposes of his majesty. He expressed his regret, that any attempt should be made at present to press into discussion the very delicate question adverted to by the hon. gentleman, as such discussion was but too likely to create a ferment in the country, while it was calculated to give pain to the illustrious personages more immediately interested. The hon. gentleman might be fully assured that the high personage to whom he referred was by no means likely to experience any thing like harshness or inattention [Hear, hear!].
 Lord Castlereagh  stated, that such provision was intended to be granted out of the sum for which his right hon. friend proposed to move.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose only for the purpose of thanking the hon. and learned gentleman for a speech which did equal honour to his head and his heart, and which must have carried conviction to all who heard it. His majesty's ministers had not lost sight of the inconvenience which might arise from a lapse of the provision which had been made for an illustrious personage, and it was their intention to submit a suitable measure to the consideration of the House.
 Sir C. Burrell  thanked lord Castlereagh for his liberal conduct hitherto on this Bill, and hoped that he would endeavour to secure its final success by using his influence with his friends in another place [Order! and Hear!] so that it might not fall to the ground after it had passed that House.
 Mr. Calcraft  said, he had never heard any thing much more disorderly than the allusion of the hon. baronet; but even if that suggestion, were attended to, he thought it quite impossible that the bill could pass into a law. It was because he was in earnest, in support of the measures which this bill professedly furthered, that he did not wish the House to be so misled, as to suppose that any assembly could pass a bill condemning four boroughs, while in the case of one only they had any evidence. It was only in the case of Barnstaple that the House of Lords had any evidence. He wished to see the writs suspended till the circumstances which had appeared to criminate these boroughs could be inquired into, and he therefore wished the House to proceed by address, which was, in his opinion, the true parliamentary course. According to the present mode of proceeding, the House was at the mercy, not only of the Crown, but of the other House of Parliament. He contended, that the issuing and suspending of writs should depend on the House alone, and upon this doctrine the House had hitherto acted.
 Mr. Wynn  said, that the proceeding by way of address would go to the overthrow of the constitution, by putting the whole elective franchise into the hands of the Crown. The address of the House could not confer on the Crown a power not before possessed; it could only call on the Crown to exercise a power already existing. It would, therefore, recognise that the Crown could, at its own will and pleasure, put an end to the elective rights of any portion of the electors of the kingdom. This proposal was not, indeed, without precedent, for he had heard of a plan of reform, promulgated under the high authority of the Hampden Club, by which the king was to be begged, as the simplest and best plan of reform, to abstain from sending writs to certain boroughs, and to send writs to other places.
 1617
 Mr. Marryat  said, the bill required serious consideration. The House had not all the evidence before them en the different cases. Besides, there were in the different cases various shades of criminality. Two of their own members also (Mr. Swann and sir M. Lopez) had been severely visited, as well as several voters of two of the boroughs. Was it likely that these persons, after the warning they had had, would again commit the crime for which they had suffered? Indeed, if he were asked where he should expect to find the greatest purity and independence in the elections throughout the country, he should naturally lay his hand on those boroughs. There was such a difference also in the evidence before the Lords and that before the Commons, respecting Barnstaple, that the difficulty concerning that case was much increased.
 Mr. Brougham  said, that his doubts as to the expediency of passing the bill were founded on his sense of the great importance of the measure ultimately in view. They were not in those circumstances, or in that period of the session, when they could enter into the consideration of a change in the representation with advantage or effect. The change now proposed was no less than to extinguish the fran-
 1618 prima facie pro hac vice, 1619
 Mr. Scarlett  thought it would be a delicate matter for the House to interfere to induce the Crown to remit a sentence which the court of King's-bench had imposed. The members of that House, too, should be the last to appear disposed to treat with lenity such offences, which they were out of doors but too generally supposed to view with favourable eyes. He was himself not prepared to say that the sentence was too severe. Though offenders of this kind might, in some instances, gain the cross, and in others the crown, the court of King's-bench did well always to show a severe front to such offences. He felt reluctant to make these observations, because he had had to appear as advocate for this individual. After having done his duty on this occasion, however, his connection with him had ceased.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, the only object of this bill was to enable the House to apply any punishment it might inflict on these boroughs earlier than they otherwise could. The non-existence of the bill would not form an obstacle to the taking cognizance of these cases in a new parliament. Though he had made up his mind to vote for the bill, he could not disguise the fact that it was a strong measure, and went beyond the precedents which had been adduced. The case of Shaftesbury only applied to the issuing of writs during the existence of a parliament over which the House had a constitutional control. But it was a bolder measure to interfere with the elections for a future parliament, when they were, in some measure, tied up to a specific number of members by the act of Union.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  maintained, that there was a sufficient  prima facie 1620
 Lord Castlereagh  thought the Shaftesbury case much, stronger than the present, as in that case the Lords had obtained from that House a copy of the evidence taken before a committee upon the subject, in order to examine such evidence before the act was agreed to.
 Mr. Tierney  declared his unwillingness to vote any sum for the queen, until some explanation should be given or promised as to the rumours which had gone abroad with respect to her conduct upon the continent. He agreed with the noble lord in thinking this a very delicate question to be discussed in that House. But by whom was it brought into discussion? Why, by ministers themselves, who, although they deprecated this discussion at present, held out the prospect of some such discussion at a future—[here lord Castlereagh intimated his dissent] "Then,". said Mr.

 Mr. Brougham  said, that early in the session of 1812, he had moved for a return of the amount and application of the different monies received by the Crown, which were not under the immediate control of parliament. This was at all times a matter of great importance, but it was more particularly so at a period like the present, when new arrangements for the support of the royal dignity were about to be entered into. The funds to which he alluded were important, as they involved a considerable variety of influence and management. When he made the motion to which he had alluded, he was answered, that arrangements having been made by parliament for supporting the civil list, it would be improper to enter into such an inquiry, as it would be a breach of the terms agreed upon. But it was admitted at the same time, that such an inquiry might be made on the demise of the Crown. He had felt the full force of this objection. But now he conceived the period was arrived when such a motion ought to be made. Those funds had arisen to such an amount that they ought to be settled on a permanent and constitutional footing. He should therefore move for, "An account of the total produce of all funds at the disposal of the Crown, and usually deemed not to be under the immediate control of parliament, since the accession of his late majesty, distinguishing the monies arising from droits of Admiralty and droits of the Crown, 4½ per cent West India duties, Scotch revenue, and those from all other such sources not hereinbefore specified.—Ordered.
 Mr. Hume  observed, that his wish was to have a distinct provision for the queen, at least equal to that which she enjoyed under the late act of parliament.
 Mr. Hume  observed, that before the Speaker left the chair, he was anxious to obtain some information upon a point, with regard to which he had on a former evening felt it his duty to put a question to the noble secretary of state, to which question he had received a very unsatisfactory answer. He meant with respect to the situation of the Queen. If there was any subject which more than another interested the feelings of that House and the public, he believed it was the condition of this illustrious personage. For what was that condition? It was clear from recent occurrences, as well as from the language of the noble lord, that the Queen was not only unacknowledged, but that it was determined that she was not
 1622 l. 1623
 Lord Palmerston  brought in a bill for continuing the Mutiny Act, from the 24th of April to the 24th of June. After a short conversation, the bill was read a first and second time.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the money to be paid out of this grant would, were it not for the demise of the Crown, have been paid in the usual way to the princess of Wales. All that was intended was, to pay the sums now due in the same manner as if that melancholy event had not taken Place.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, the right hon. gentleman knew that this or any other payment, officially made, could not alter the state of the party receiving it.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the sum formerly granted to the princess of Wales was now payable to the queen, and to no other person.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the individual to whom the grant had been made still remained, though her political character was changed. Her majesty had a right to receive in her present situation what had been granted to her in another.
 Mr. Tierney  repeated, that there being no such personage as the princess of Wales, any grant to the queen should be so stated to parliament.
 Mr. Tierney  observed, that the only provision he knew of was made for the princess of Wales—but there was now no such personage in existence. How, then, could they vote a grant of this kind? He knew the right hon. gentleman dared not mention the name of the queen. But could they, he would ask, give to an individual not mentioned in the grant a sum of money voted to another person? He should like to hear the chancellor of the exchequer mention the name of the queen, as he wished to have it recorded on the Journals.
 Mr. Tierney  denied the power of the right hon. gentleman to make any such
 1630
 Mr. Tierney  said, he wished to know from what fund, the money necessary for the support of the queen was to be paid? During the late reign, provision was made for the princess of Wales, but now that royal personage was queen of England.
 Mr. Hume  asked, why such difficulty was made about mentioning at once that the grant was for the queen? By merely stating this the objection of the right hon. gentleman would at once be met.
 Mr. Lushington  said, that the grant moved for was stated to be for paying of annuities, &c. payable out of the civil list, and which would have been duly paid but for the demise of the Crown. It would be improper to mention the name of her majesty as one of the persons receiving an annuity, unless all the other names were also mentioned, which it

 Sir William Scott  rose for the purpose of submitting a motion to supply the vacancy in the honourable office of Speaker. He had never claimed the attention of the House with more unmixed satisfaction, from a conviction that the opinion he entertained upon this subject was universal among the honourable gentlemen whom he was addressing. Although the distinguished individual who had presided over the deliberations of the House during the two last parliaments had perhaps the most indisputable title again to fill the same office, he could not but be

 Lord Castlereagh  said, that, in the situation in which the House now found itself, the only question that remained was that of adjournment; but he hoped he might be permitted, in the name of the House, as well as for himself, to offer his congratulation on the choice that had just been made. From the manner in which the proposition of his right hon. friend had been received, it was obvious that the House was anxious to bestow on the individual now appointed to preside over its discussions, the highest mark of its approbation and confidence; and there could be no such mark in this free country more distinguished, than that of being rendered the first commoner of the empire. It was undoubtedly a matter of proud satisfaction, that at the period when the Speaker was placed in the chair, all opinions were united in his favour. He was sure that the House would feel what had been already observed, that, without touching upon the peculiar importance of the times in which we lived (and certainly that man must take a very superficial view of the condition of affairs who should consider them but ordinary times), the office of Speaker included many important duties connected with the jarring interests of this mighty empire, while parliament was. devoting its attention to promote its welfare and. prosperity. It

 Mr. Holme Sumner  seconded the motion. He said, he had not sat so long in parliament without having obtained some knowledge of the arduous duties of the Speaker: the great increase of public business had of late added much to the severity of the burthen. In thus supporting the proposition of the right hon. mover he was aware that he was placing himself in a situation to which he had no other claim than the length of time during which he had filled a seat in parliament: his service as a representative had taught him how much of the regularity and dignity of their proceedings were connected with the office of Speaker. If he had had to recommend a gentleman who was unknown, it would have been proper to have entered at some length into the foundation of his claim; but, as had been already remarked, the individual now proposed had proved himself, in every way, worthy of the confidence and approbation of the House. As be had never known Mr. Manners Sutton but in his public capacity, he could not propose him with the partiality of private friend-

 Mr. Brougham,  in the absence of those more competent and more worthy generally to express the feelings of those who sat on his side of the House, trusted that it would not be thought presumptuous if he added his testimony to that of the hon. gentleman who had preceded him. He took the liberty, therefore, to congratulate, first the Speaker, but most of all the House itself, and not less the House than the whole Commons of England, upon the free choice which had now fallen, for the third time, upon the same individual. He was sure that he expressed only the general sentiment in the wish that the Speaker now elected might continue with the enjoyment of health and long life to fill a station equally necessary for the support of the privileges of the House, and for the preservation of the liberties of, the people at large; and the duties of which, he grieved to say, by the common consent of all, were not likely to be lightened. It was a matter of most sincere congratulation to the House and to the country, that it had again the inestimable benefit of having the chair filled by one who had shown himself, in all the more important, as well as in the less material parts of the functions of his situation, eminently gifted for their discharge; who had upon every occasion proved that he was indeed the depository of the truest dignity of the House, by wearing the honours conferred upon him both with firmness and meekness. It formed one of his highest and most essential titles to the office, that on all necessary occasions he had evinced the courage as well as the capacity to protect the sacred privileges of the House from infraction, under whatever pretext, whether assaulted by lawless violence, or

 Mr. Manners Sutton  rose amid the cheers of the House. He said, he hoped that neither the right hon. gentleman who had moved his nomination in a manner so

 The Speaker  informed the House, that they had been in the House of Peers, where the commissioners, authorized by his majesty's commission, had communicated to him that his majesty had been graciously pleased to approve of their choice of him as Speaker. He had thereupon immediately proceeded to claim for them their ancient rights and privileges of freedom of speech, freedom from arrest for themselves and servants, free access to the royal presence, &c. all of which his majesty had been graciously pleased to grant to them in as full and ample manner as ever had been granted on any former occasion. He must again express the deep sense of gratitude which he felt to the House for having thus conferred on him this, the highest mark of confidence in their power; and he must now implore them to give him their constant support to enable him to preserve their privilege which were not only theirs, but the privileges of all the Commons of England. He had also to entreat their constant and unremitting support and assistance in preserving the established rules and orders of the House; not less necessary for the preservation of decency and regularity in their proceedings, than they were for the convenient dispatch of business. It should be his constant study so to discharge the duties of his high situation as to give satisfaction to the House, and in such a manner as should be most useful to the public, and conducive to his own honour. The first business which gentlemen had now to attend the was, to take the several
 11
 Mr. Tierney  said, he was not disposed to quarreh with a great deal that had fallen from the hon. mover and seconder; on the contrary, he agreed with them entirely upon some points; and if at all times he felt it unnecessary to bring forward matter of difference where none was offered on the other side, he should be peculiarly unwilling to do so on the present occasion, when the first speech of a new sovereign was before the House. The fair, cool, and temperate tone of the hon. gentlemen who had just taken their seats, formed another inducement for him not to express any dissent; or, supposing the. speech from the throne had contained any particular phrase, ambiguous or liable to misconstruction, what they had said on the various points would probably have rendered explanation needless. He congratulated the House on the prevailing unanimity; he hoped it was an earnest of the future, and that all parties in the House would unite in the expression of unshaken loyalty to the Crown, and of a firm determination, while the true liberties of the people were supported, to set themselves honestly and steadily against those machinations alike directed against the happiness and security of the sovereign and his subjects. In that direction he would go as far as any man; and beyond that, happily, on the present occasion, it was not necessary to say more. He therefore again congratulated the House on the favourable auspices under which the new session was commenced.
 Sir Francis Burdett  said, that he should be very sorry if he were supposed capable of showing any disrespect to the throne, by disturbing the unanimity so desirable on the present occasion. He should certainty be reluctant to do so for the reasons already stated; but he could not at the same time avoid observing, that for some few years past the House had been placed in rather an awkward and disagreeable predicament with regard to the speeches from the throne, Formerly it was expected that they should be a full and fair statement of the whole situation of the country, instead of being frittered away, as at present, into mere matters of form and compliment, in which gentlemen might or might not concur according to the state of their own feelings, and the respect which all ought to feel towards the person of the sovereign, but a non-concurrence in which need not be intruded upon the House when all questions

 Mr. Wilmot  rose to second the address, and said, that he did not yield to the hon. mover in the earnest hope which he had expressed, that the House would unanimously agree to the address; and he trusted that no expression would fall from him which could in any degree tend to provoke discussion, or interrupt the unanimity of the House. He would avoid the introduction of any topics which might more properly come under the subsequent consideration of the House; but there was one topic on which he could anticipate the unanimous feelings of the House—he meant the demise of our late venerable sovereign. Looking at the period of his accession to the throne in the prime of life and the pride of hope, and contrasting it with the mournful close of his life, when confined within the precincts of his palace, and bereft of that sense which might have mitigated his afflictions, he was shut out from almost all the consolations which this life affords. Whatever difference of opinion might exist as to the policy of the measures pursued during his reign, every feeling of irritation must subside at the contemplation of so awful an instance of the instability of human grandeur. The recollection of the paternal solicitude with which he uniformly watched over the interests of the. people, would secure to his memory the lasting gratitude of the country. His reign, one of the longest in our annals, was distinguished by an event so prominent, as almost to monopolize our attention;—he alluded to the French revolution, an event which might justly be considered as one of the most extraordinary in the history of nations, whether we regarded its origin, its continuance or its termination. It had terminated in a military despotism, which threatened to overwhelm the whole civilised world, but which had been, at length, triumphantly

 Sir Edward Knatchbull  rose. He said, he should take the liberty of directing the attention of the House to the gracious speech which they had heard, for the purpose of proposing such an address to his majesty as should accord with their feelings of loyalty, and their affectionate regret for the loss of his late majesty; and therefore he hoped, such an address as would be unanimously sanctioned by both sides of the House. In discharging this duty he should have occasion to refer to various topics, and he felt that his best claim to the indulgence of the House would be the assurance that he should not encroach at any great length on their attention. On the present occasion he felt particularly anxious that the address which he was about to propose should be adopted by an unanimous vote of the House. The recent accession of his majesty, and this being the first opportunity he had had of meeting his parliament, were, in his mind, grounds of very considerable weight; and, in the present situation of the country, an address from parliament in favour of its established government was of material importance. When he spoke of the government of the country, he of course did not mean the persons by whom the functions of government were discharged, but the constitution of the country itself. In the address which he was about to submit to the consideration of the House, nothing of a political nature would be found to militate against the attainment of that unanimity which was so desirable. On looking forward to the course which ministers might be about to adopt, he meant not to pledge himself, much less the House, if it should agree to this address, to support any particular measures. He could, with great truth, state to the House, that if, in moving this address, he had considered that lie was compromising the principle of any measure that might be afterwards brought forward, he would not have been found to discharge that duty. Before he proceeded to the consideration of the principal points in the speech which they had heard read, it would not be right if he did not

 Sir H. Par-
 40  rose to give notice, that on Thursday, the 11th of May, his right hon. friend, the member for Dublin (Mr. Grattan), would submit to the House a motion for the removal of the disabilities which the law at present imposed on his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects.
 Lord John Russell  gave notice of a motion for leave to bring in a bill to disfranchise the borough or Grampound, and to transfer the elective franchise to the borough of Leeds. He also begged leave to say, that in the course of the session he intended to submit to the House a motion for shortening the duration of sir M. Lopez's imprisonment.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  stated, in reply to the questions of the noble lord, that the expense already incurred considerably exceeded the 50,000 l. 43
 Mr. Tierney  said, he could not help observing, that the papers before the House seemed to be all very clear, with the exception of the sum of 385,000 l. l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that it had been from time to time the practice of parliament, that certain monies, arising from particular colonial funds, should be added to the privy purse. But the right hon. gentleman would see,
 44 l., l.
 Mr. Tierney  knew that the allowance of 60,000 l. l.,
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that such had been the immemorial usage.
 Mr. Tierney  wished to know, whether they were to understand that the funds of the Crown might be enlarged in this manner by his majesty's ministers? If not, how did it happen that this 6,000 l. l., l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that it was impossible to give a specific account of such appropriations, occurring in the earlier years of so extended a reign, although it might be in his power to show in what manner they had been made during the latter part of it.
 Mr. Tierney  said, that the excess of 385,000 l.,
 Lord A. Hamilton  said, that it was not his intention to trouble the House at any length, but he could not allow the present opportunity to pass without impressing on the minds of the right hon. gentlemen opposite the necessity of attending to the distress of that part of the country with which he was connected. When the House recollected that fourteen or fifteen weeks ago the commerce and manufactures of the country had been represented to be in a most flourishing condition, and when they compared that declaration with the statements in the Speech delivered yesterday from the throne, they must all be struck with the sudden change which had taken place in the aspect of the country; and he, for one, should not think that he discharged his duty conscientiously, if he did not on the present occasion suggest what he conceived might be applied in mitigation of the evil. They would all remember that a sum of 50,000 l. 41 42
 Lord A. Hamilton  gave notice, that he meant to bring before the House the question of the Scotch representation; and, to keep clear of the time just fixed on by his hon. friend, he should bring forward his motion on the 24th of May. He also gave notice, that on Thursday next he should move for the revival of the committee on the Scotch burghs.
 Mr. Brougham  said, that upon the subject of the civil list it might be matter of convenience to the House to understand when it would be brought forward. He deeply regretted that it was one which was not to remain in the hands of hon. gentlemen opposite. He did hope that those hon. gentlemen would have submitted the matter to the consideration of
 45 non constat pro tanto,
 Mr. Brougham  gave notice, that, at an early period after the Whitsuntide holydays, he should submit a motion relative to the education of the poor. Although he was aware that it was irregular to enter in to any explanation on rising merely to give a notice, yet he trusted the House would allow him to observe, that the delay which had already occurred was owing to anything rather than to his being less sensible than formerly of the importance of education. On the contrary, the events which had lately occurred had rather strengthened his conviction of the indispensable necessity of imparting education to the poor. One cause of the delay which had taken place was, that the Education Digest, on which the measures which he should have to propose would be founded, could not be sooner prepared; and it was desirable that it should be in the hands of members before the question was brought under discussion. Another reason for his not fixing an earlier period was, that the discussion of the civil list, incident to the commencement of a reign, would occupy the attention of the House for a considerable time, and it, was desirable that the discussions on these two subjects should be kept separate. Longer, however, than till after the holydays, he could not consent to postpone the consideration of this important question.
 Mr. Lambton  rose to renew the notice which he had given in the last session of parliament of his intention to bring before the House the present state of the representation; and he now gave notice that he should submit a motion on that subject on Tuesday the 6th of June. As far as he could judge, that arrangement would not interfere with the other business of the House.
 Mr. Hume  was very anxious to know what the colonial funds in question were.
 Mr. Finlay  agreed with what had been stated by his noble friend respecting the distressed state of the country; and when the right hon. gentleman stated that only 5,000 persons had gone to the Cape of Good Hope, the House would see that by the regulations adopted it had been impossible for the distressed population to relieve themselves. It was impossible for them to pay any sum of money, however small; and therefore, if the means of emigration were not granted unconditionally, and as a boon, he feared they could not avail themselves of the opportunity afforded. He believed his noble friend was in possession of many communications, as he himself was, from persons who, though perfectly willing to emigrate, could not transport themselves, being destitute of all means whatever. He was confident that the subject required only to be brought forward by government in such a practical manner as to engage attention, and that a sum of money, comparatively small, would be productive of great benefit, since those who were removed would not only be relieved themselves, but would relieve those to whom they were at present a burthen.
 Sir E. Knatchbull  brought up the report of the Address on the King's Speech. Upon the motion, that it be read a second time,
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he had searched the Journals of the House, and had found two precedents in former reigns wherein it had been the practice of the House to return thanks for the royal answer to the address presented to the throne by the first parliament of a new reign; therefore as hon. gentlemen had now heard read from the chair the most gracious answer of his present majesty, he should move "that an humble address be presented to his majesty returning the most humble thanks of this House for his most gracious answer to the address; and that such address be presented to his majesty by such members of this House as were members of his majesty's privy council."—The motion was agreed to.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  was not entirely prepared to answer the question of the hon. gentleman. The subject was one which had long occupied the attention of his majesty's ministers. He was quite aware of its importance, but he apprehended that no general meausre could be brought in during the present session; some preliminary steps, however, might be taken.
 The Lord Advocate  replied, that the appointment had already taken place several weeks ago.
 The Lord Advocate  had no doubt but that he should be able to satisfy the House of the propriety of any measure of this sort which had been adopted, whenever the period arrived for its discussion.
 The Lord Advocate  was not cognizant of the particular transaction to which the learned gentleman alluded; but it was in consequence of express representations that the business of the judges of the jury-courts had so much increased, that their office could not be carried on without an addition to their number that that addition had been made.
 Lord A. Hamilton,  after this information, should feel it his duty to bring the subject before the House; but at present he was not prepared to say whether he should do so by moving for a copy of the appointment, or for a vote of censure upon the adviser of such an appointment.
 Lord A. Hamilton  then gave notice, that he should move for a copy of the appointment on the 11th of May.
 Lord A. Hamilton  begged to be informed whether it was true that a new appointment had taken place, or was about
 49
 Mr. H. Sumner  adverted to the great inconveniences under which the county of Surrey laboured, owing to the varying and uncertain state of weights and measures. He said that the city of London had formerly felt the great inconvenience and disadvantage of a similar state of things, and conceived that, acting under their own authority, they were capable of subdividing the standard measure in the Exchequer, and and of making those subdivisions the standards of weights and measures within their jurisdiction. Now, the county of
 48
 Mr. Brougham  was not at all surprised that the judges of the jury-court, as parties in the case, should have recommended the addition; and he grieved that an hon. and learned friend of his was at that time a member of that very court. He pledged himself, however, to prove, that a grosser job, a more palpable job, or one more outrageous to the feelings of a burthened public, had never been transacted, even in Scotland.
 Mr. Brougham  wished to ask the learned lord one question about the filling up of an appointment. The learned lord had once in his place remarked, that some officers of the jury-courts of Scotland being thought necessary, their appointments could not be filled up until parliament met. In consequence, however, of their having discovered a very gross transaction, which he would not characterize in the language that it deserved, it appeared otherwise. Had an additional number of judges of the jury-courts been really appointed? For the transaction he spoke of was really one of the most outrageous and gross jobs that ever had been done.
 Mr. H. Clive  laid on the table a number of papers and reports connected with the commission to inquire into the receipt of fees, &c. in the courts of justice in Scotland. He moved they should be printed.
 Sir John Newport  was exceedingly anxious that his noble friend should bring this motion under discussion, either by moving for a copy of the appointment, or by any other mode of proceeding which he might think proper. He greatly lamented that not one step had yet been taken to realize the suggestions of many of the most intelligent members of that committee.
 Mr. Mills  from his own personal observation, confirmed all that had been said in favour of the invention of Mr.
 53
 Mr. Alderman Wood  said, that the question which he now thought it his duty to bring under the consideration of the House was one of the greatest importance, and particularly to the House itself. He might be wrong in the course which he had proposed to himself to pursue; but if he was, the Speaker would no doubt instruct him what was the proper mode of bringing the matter forward. He repeated that he considered it as one in which the House was most deeply concerned. He had come to the determination of treating it as a breach of privilege; and would here very briefly state what were the facts. Seven persons had recently applied to him, in his official capacity of magistrate, for a warrant to take up a man stated to be then resident in Fleet-street, whose name was said to be George Edwards. He immediately went into a private examination of those individuals, with the assistance of a most able and worthy brother magistrate (sir W. Domville). Four of the parties deposed to some very material facts, some of which, affecting the safety of that House, he should now mention; but others, which were detailed at great length, were of too horrible a description for him to repeat. They involved a plot, not merely to effect the destruction of that House, and the hon. members within it, but of one of the highest personages in this kingdom, and
 55 clean." 56 57
 Mr. Bathurst  observed, that the only question for the House to determine was, whether that which had been stated by the worthy alderman called upon them to take up the matter as a breach of privilege. The motion did not require any other reference to the circumstances which had been described by the worthy alderman than this—could those circumstances be construed into a breach of privilege? Now really he besought the House to consider what sort of precedent they would establish, if they acquiesced in the worthy alderman's motion. Here was a man, who, according to the worthy alderman, was an accomplice, or rather a principal, in the conspiracy for which several unfortunate persons had lately forfeited their lives. According to the worthy alderman, that man was deeply implicated in the crime for which those persons had suffered and if the motion was agreed to, he would be called to the bar to be examined on a charge of having committed a breach of privilege, when, if the allegations of the worthy alderman were borne out by the fact, he would be found to have committed an overt act of treason. If any other course could be adopted in which the case might be fairly investigated, he would concur in it; but if the worthy alderman really believed that the individual in question had projected the attempt against that House which had been described, he would recommend the worthy alderman to withdraw a motion for calling that individual to the bar, in the supposition that he would there charge himself with such an offence.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  said, he certainly set out with intimating that he saw great difficulties in this question; and from his inexperience in that House it was naturally to be expected that he should feel that uncertainty, in a case of this kind, which those of greater parliamentary knowledge would not experience. He was, indeed, quite happy to hear the right hon. gentleman observe, that if the business were brought before the House properly, the House would properly entertain it. He thought it right to state that he had applied to another quarter, to get the individual in question prosecuted, but in that application he had been disappointed [Hear, hear!]]. He had already stated, that he did not think proper to read the answer which he had received when he had felt it his duty to carry the evidence which had been submitted to him, to the office of the home department. He was certainly not satisfied with that determination. Several of the deponents were persons not at all implicated in the late transactions; and their evidence was, in his opinion, fully sufficient to convict the person in question. Still, however, he had been told in another quarter, that it was not so, although the depositions contained matter, which, of course, he had not communicated to the House, but which would make them shudder if the heard it. The impression on his mind certainly was, that the accused person should be taken up. He took it for granted that the gentlemen opposite knew where that person was to be found, and that he could not escape. Having him in their possession—having it in their power to bring him forward, he thought they ought immediately to do so. Edwards was charged with being the sole promoter of the treasonable conspiracy which had been formed. It was declared to be his practice to lay hold of all the desperate characters whom he could find, and to bring them into his diabolical practices. He thought he could safely pledge himself to prove by indisputable evidence that Edwards was the sole plotter and founder of the Cato-street conspiracy. He had discharged his duty by bringing the subject under the consideration of the House. After what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman, he should certainly be disposed to withdraw his motion, although he was not prepared to propose any other course of proceeding
 Mr. Alderman Wood  expressed his willingness to withdraw the motion. He begged, however, to say, that he thought in the mariner in which he introduced it, he had avoided any thing justly exceptionable. He had abstained from reading the deposition, for he should be sorry that the dreadful allegations which it contained should at present go forth to the world; and he had therefore confined himself to a description of that part of it. which most nearly touched the House. At the present moment he was not prepared to bring the motion forward in another shape, but he thought he should do so in the course of a day or two, and that he should move for the appointment of a secret committee to investigate the case.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that he would, on this occasion, merely move a series of resolutions relative to the civil list, on the understanding which had previously taken place, that the question should be discussed on the bringing up of the report on Friday next. He then moved, "That it is the opinion of this committee, that for the support of his majesty's household, and of the honour and dignity of the crown, there be granted
 64 l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, it was generally understood that, in the first instance, the resolutions would be agreed to without observation, leaving the discussion on them to a future period.—The number of members who had left the House clearly proved that this feeling generally prevailed.
 Colonel Davies  fully understood, and so did the whole House, that the arrangement of the civil-list was to proceed on the basis of the act of 1816. That arrangement provided a sum of 1,063,000 l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that certain English allowances must be confirmed and continued; but still, after making the deductions alluded to by the hon. gentleman there would be a clear saving to the public, except so far as it might be deemed proper hereafter to make some alteration.
 Colonel Davies  said, his having fallen into this error was an additional argument in favour of delay. It showed how unprepared members were on this subject, and, he trusted, therefore that ministers would not press it forward.
 Mr. Tierney  felt himself called on to draw the attention of the House to what had passed on a former occasion. He was the person who put certain questions to the chancellor of the exchequer. He asked, whether it was the right hon. gentleman's intention, previously to the introduction of the resolutions, to refer any papers to the House, as the ground-work of that which he meant to propose? The right hon. gentleman answered, that no such mode of proceeding was in contemplation, but that he meant at once to proceed by way of resolution, and by that means to point out to parliament the objects he had in view. He (Mr. T.) stated that it was a matter of great importance, and, therefore, he was desirous not to go to the detail unprepared. He, in consequence, suggested, that, when the resolutions were proposed, and the statement of the right hon. gentleman was laid before them, nothing should be done to provoke a debate, but that the House should merely be put in possession of the line which government intended to pursue-On this occasion, he confessed he felt disappointed that the right hon. gentleman had not declared the ground on which he meant to proceed, instead of proposing a resolution having for its object the application of a gross sum. In this state of things, no gentleman was bound to abstain from debating the question now; and he appealed to the other side of the House, as well as to his own, whether the understanding amounted to any thing more than he had stated. He regretted that the right hon. gentleman had not coupled his proposition with some statement of the grounds on which he meant to act. However, in agreeing to the resolution now, he did not consider himself bound to take any particular course at a future day. When that period arrived, it would be open to any gentleman to move an amendment, to the proposition of the chancellor of the exchequer. One question he would now ask. The civil list was, he understood, to be settled on the basis of the settlement of 1816. Were no other deductions to be made in the new arrangement but the sum applicable to the maintenance of the establishment at Windsor—the sum applicable to the privy
 67
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the right hon. gentleman had accurately conceived the purport of the resolution before the House. It referred to the whole revenue granted in 1816, with the exception of the expense of the Windsor establishment, 60,000 l. l. l.
 Mr. Tierney  asked, what became of the sum of 58,000 l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the provision for her late majesty came from the consolidated fund, independent of the civil list.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, the provision for the queen might be charged on the consolidated fund, in the same way as had been done with respect to her late majesty.
 Lord Archibald Hamilton  said, he was anxious to know what the views of ministers were on the whole subject, before he acted on a part of it, particularly on that part which he considered as by far the most critical. He spoke with reference to the queen. He wished to know in what proportion her majesty was to be provided for; he wished to know in what manner the gentlemen opposite meant to introduce that part of the civil list at all to their consideration. At that moment her income had wholly ceased, she had no subsistence. He did not mean to say any thing to promote premature discussion. He would not, at present, discuss so delicate a topic as that which he had glanced at, because it would be very embarrassing to him as well as to the House. At the same time, he feared that the course they were now pursuing would prevent him from introducing it at a future period. If he were called on to vote these resolutions to-day, and to debate them when the report was brought up, be might be told that that was the time for considering the details, and not for arguing on the merits and principles of the system. If, however, the whole subject would be open for discussion at a future period, lie had no objection to let the resolutions pass.
 Lord A. Hamilton  expressed himself satisfied by this explanation.
 Mr. Canning  said, that undoubtedly the noble lord would find every point connected with the arrangement of this question open to discussion, not, only with reference to form, but to sense and un-
 68
 Mr. Canning  said, the general understanding of the House was, that these resolutions should pass without discussion, and that the debate should be taken on the report. He was aware, in strict argument, that there was nothing in this to bind gentlemen from considering the question; but if, on every occasion, the feeling and opinion of each individual in the House were to be taken on a point of this kind, there would be an end of courteous understanding and accommodation. He was sure the right hon. gentleman opposite would bear him out when he said that it was thought much more convenient not to take the debate in this stage of the proceeding. He was quite convinced that neither his right. hon. friend, nor any other person in the situation of a responsible minister, would offer, for permanent settlement, not a proposal of his own, but of those whom he had consulted, without giving a fair opportunity for the discussion of its merits. If there were gentlemen
 66
 Mr. Canning  disclaimed any intention of imputing the slightest blame to the worthy alderman. He certainly disagreed with the worthy alderman as to the expediency of his motion, but he saw nothing whatever to criticise in the manner in which it had been brought forward.
 Mr. Canning  said, that whatever might be the ultimate decision of the House on the subject, whether they would determine on entering into the investigation of it or not, there was one point on which all must agree, namely the inutility of discussing it at a time, and on a question, the decision of which could lead to no satisfactory result. The hon. and learned gentleman seemed to have collected what he was sure the House had not, namely, that there was a disposition on the part of some honourable members to treat the whole affair with levity and ridicule. Really he had not seen any such disposition. He was sure that no such disposition had been manifested, either by himself or his honourable friends about him. As little Could he plead guilty to the other charge, of a pre-disposition to accuse the hon. and learned gentleman of joining the popular cry against informers—a subject on which the hon. and learned gentleman had just made the most just and manly observations. He could assure the hon. and learned gentleman, that he never entertained such a pre-disposition; and if he had, it must have been entirely removed by the hon. and learned gentleman's candid statement of his opinion. On that statement, without wishing to add a single word to it, he was perfectly content to rest the defence, not only of the present or of any particular government, but of all governments that had ever existed in this or in any other civilized country, for taking the means which circumstances rendered necessary, to defeat
 63
 Mr. Brougham  confessed that he wished the worthy alderman would take the advice of the right hon. gentleman rather than that of his hon. friend; and that he would withdraw his motion. But he begged to be by no means understood to join in the expression of levity, which, very much to his surprise and pain, had been drawn from some hon. members by the grave and extraordinary statements which had been made—statements which, in his opinion, were not at all of a character to provoke laughter. He was certainly not disposed to say that the present was precisely an occasion on which it was fitting for the House to resort to the law of privilege; but at the same time, if the
 60 61 62
 Mr. Brougham  rose to put his hon. friend, the member for Aberdeen, right. There were other branches of revenue, besides the hereditary revenues of the Crown, which he wished to see accounted for. The hereditary revenues, his hon. friend must be aware, his majesty had been graciously pleased to give up to the consideration of parliament. But there were others, such as the Scotch revenue, which was indeed very small, that had been alluded to by him. He conceived, as to the accommodation, that it was only a parliamentary mode of introducing the resolutions into the House, in order to get them printed. He approved of the proposal of the hon. baronet to have the report recommitted, but he considered himself bound not to object to the mode of proceeding at present proposed. 72
 Mr. Lockhart  wished that the subject should be treated upon as extended a basis as possible, and that provision should be made against a class of prisoners who had formerly taken the benefit of the act, though it was not intended for their relief; he meant those who were confined in consequence of actions for damages, having
 54
 Mr. Hume  did not approve of the plan now proposed. In 1815-16, when an inquiry into the civil list was called for, it was shut out, and they were then told that a time would occur when it would be proper to investigate the hereditary revenues, and those branches over which the House had no control. The House had therefore a right to take into consideration the state of the king's separate hereditary revenue; the revenue, for instance, derived from Scotland, which produced 80,000 l. l. 69 l. 70 l. l. l.
 Mr. Hume,  as he understood from the
 59
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  said, that the subject to which he had now to draw the attention of the House was one of serious importance. The House was no doubt aware, that, excepting in cases where death ensued, under the present law, a stage-coachman who drove furiously, to the imminent; hazard of life and limb, could scarcely be punished at all; where a coach was over-turned, and the passengers were so injured that death was the ultimate consequence, the punishment upon the proprietors was only a fine of 10 l.
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  said, it was in the recollection of many members, that during the session preceding the last, he had moved for a committee to inquire into the practicability of erecting steam engines and furnaces in such a manner as to relieve the places in which they were erected from the intolerable nuisance which their intense smoke had so generally produced to the health and comfort of the population of large cities and towns. That committee had been granted to him, and their report was in the possession of the House. If gentlemen would take the trouble of attending to its suggestions, they would find substantial reasons to be satisfied that such a very desirable improvement could be both easily and promptly effected. From, the manner in which these furnaces were erected, and increased as they were in number, London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and other extensive cities and towns, were almost become uninhabitable [a laugh]. Gentlemen might laugh at the term, but he contended it was strictly true, as the persons engaged in business in these towns were actually compelled to guard the health of their families from the deleterious effects of the ebullitions of smoke issuing from those furnaces, by removing to hired houses at a distance from the place of their avocations. The whole of these dense ebullitions of smoke, which made the air of large places so unhealthy, and propagated fever and disease, principally arose from the furnaces as they were at present constructed. That such an evil could be corrected, and corrected without injury to the persons engaged in business connected with these steam engines, he was cer
 51 52
 Mr. Denman  seconded the motion, and bore his fullest testimony to the facts stated by his hon. friend, as to Mr. Parkes's manufactory at Warwick. He had seen three furnaces at work, and not the slightest appearance of smoke. He had no doubt that the public knowledge of the thing would of itself be sufficient to introduce the improvement into general practice, without the necessity of recourse to a declaratory law. He paid a high compliment to Mr. Parkes, for the merit of this important invention, which was remarkable for its simplicity. Of its successful result the public would soon have an opportunity of judging, by means of its introduction into the brewery of Messrs. Barclay and Co., and into other establishments in the metropolis. The country, he said, was much indebted to his hon. friend for bringing such questions before the legislature.
 Sir C. Mordaunt  had also seen the manufactory of Mr. Parkes, and had admired the ingenious and at the same time effectual method in which the desirable object was accomplished. It would, he was satisfied, be generally adopted as soon as it was generally known.
 Sir H. Parnell  thought, that as frequent opportunities ought to be given for discussing this subject, the report ought to be recommitted after the subject should have been debated. This was the only mode of doing justice to a question involving so many details. Great prejudice and injury to the public would arise from any other mode of proceeding. He certainly would have opposed the accommodation now acted upon, if he had been in the House when it was agreed to. Instead of considering this subject in a committee of the whole House, which the right hon. gentleman would not allow, all the papers and documents on the subject ought, in his opinion, to have been referred to a select committee.
 Sir H. Parnell  was of opinion, that the sum now proposed was too large to permit the House to come to a vote on it at once, as a mere matter of course. He conceived, that, before they were called on to grant such a sum, papers should be laid before the House for their information. It appeared to him that they did not possess that extent of knowledge on this subject which would enable them, in considering the question, to do their duty to the country. They were directed, by the Speech from the throne, to provide for the civil government, and for his majesty's household. They were also informed that the state of the hereditary revenues was to be considered by parliament. Now it appeared to him, that they ought not to discuss those important matters of finance without full information. They ought to know, specifically, what the expenses of the civil government amounted to. That would afford an excellent opportunity to the House for carrying into effect that retrenchment which was necessary in the present state of the finances of the country. With respect to the household, it was improper, he thought, to continue a system, against which so many objections had been made by the highest authority. When he said this, he need only allude to the celebrated speech of Mr. Burke. As to the hereditary revenues, it was a grave matter of consideration by what mode those revenues could be made productive. There was a considerable expenditure incurred in their collection, and opinions had been stated by the committee of finance, that the House had an opportunity of making great savings under that head. Other matters ought also to be brought under the consideration of the House; for instance, the revenues derivable from the duchy of Lancaster and the principality of Wales. All these matters should be locked into before the House did any thing with reference to these particular resolutions. He knew not what papers might be necessary to enable him to take a just view of the subject; but, undoubtedly, a considerable number was
 65
 Lord Althorp  moved for leave to bring in a bill to amend the Insolvent Debtors act. In the present stage he should only advert to two leading distinctions from the present bill which he intended to introduce; the first was, to empower commissioners out of court to inquire into the affairs of the debtor: and the second was, to grant creditors the power of compelling reluctant debtors, when imprisoned, to be released by the act.
 Mr. Stuart Worthy  presented a petition from the worsted manufacturers of Nottingham, against the duty imposed during die last parliament on the importation of Foreign Wool. The same feeling pervaded, he well knew, the West Riding of Yorkshire; but as the question would be most probably brought before the House in a definite shape for its repeal, all he would say at present was, that he considered the imposition of that duty as a most impolitic and cruel measure.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the greater part of the information required by the hon. baronet was already before the House in different shapes, but it could not be collected and copied without such a loss of time as would be extremely inconvenient on a measure of so much importance and urgency. For the purpose of economical reduction, he could not see why it was necessary to enter now into a full examination of the official establishments paid out of the civil list. Many other offices came under the head of civil contingencies, which were annually brought before parliament. As to the report of 1815, he thought there could be no difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of copies of it to inform all who would be willing to go through its voluminous details, and he did not think it necessary to reprint it. He moved the previous question.
 Mr. Tierney  said, that it would be impossible to come to a vote on the resolutions of the chancellor of the exchequer
 75
 Mr. Calcraft  hoped that the hon. baronet would not withdraw his motion, and give way, unless the chancellor of the exchequer would undertake that the report of 1815 should be reprinted. He believed it contained all the information required by this motion.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that when the question was brought before the House in the definite manner to which allusion had been made, he was sure it would receive the fullest consideration. He had, however, in answer to the argument of the noble lord, who contended, that as a measure of revenue, it had wholly failed, to say, that it had not yet been fairly tried. It came partially into operation in October last, was only extended in January, while at the time there was a large stock of foreign wool in the market.
 Mr. Tierney  supposed, that the question would be set at rest before gentlemen had that report in their hands. They were to decide first, and have the report afterwards. Besides, he wished for additional information. He wanted to know what had been done since 1816.
 Mr. Tierney  admitted that where no application for assistance was made by the Crown, it was not customary to inquire into the civil list expenditure. The speech of the right hon. gentleman was, however, one of the most extraordinary he had ever heard, because he stated the case as if there was a civil list in existence—the question being, how to form a civil list? They were not now dealing with a civil list actually in being—they were called on,  de novo, 81 l., 82
 Lord John Russell  said, it seemed to be the intention of his majesty's ministers, at the commencement of a new reign, to take as a model in the arrangement of the civil list, the arrangement made five years ago, notwithstanding all the changes which had since taken place, and without consenting to any inquiry on the subject. That was certainly not his view of the way in which the House of Commons, at a time of such extreme pressure, ought to perform its duty to the country. He did not know whether the hon. gentleman's motion was that which was best calculated to obtain the desired information (although it appeared to him to be a very fair and proper one), but he was perfectly satisfied that the House of Commons would not do its duty, if it consented to any proposition for the permanent establishment of a civil list without any further inquiry.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  opposed the motion. The documents called for could not, he said, be useful to the hon. gentleman for the object he had in view. The act of 1816 required that, if there was an additional charge on the civil list exceeding the estimate by the sum of 16,000 l. 79
 Mr. Hume  called on the right hon. gentleman to point out where one account connected with the civil list receipts and expenditure since 1816 was to be found. He thought it was most unfair to refuse this information, since individuals would not, hereafter, be able to alter the arrangement, as they might now do, if they were in possession of those accounts. The system had been changed by two acts of parliament; but ministers did not always keep within the letter of those acts. According to the report of 1815, the sum of 3,747,000 l. l. l. in limine,
 Mr. Hume  proceeded to make his second motion. He avowed that his intention was, that the details of the last year's expenditure should be laid on the table, in order that the absurdity of many of the items might be shown. Was it not fitting that the House, in the present distressed state of the country, should have every information on the subject, when among the items were such sums in the 7th class as 1,372 l. l
 Mr. Hume  said, he would not go on with the remaining motions of a similar nature which he held in his hand; he must, however, again state, that the accessible accounts on the subject took weeks and months to understand, although a single hour's labour on the part of the clerks would obviate that inconvenience. The motion which be was now about to make was of a very different nature. It was surely most important, when the House were called upon to vote a civil revenue to his majesty for the support of the royal household, that they should know what sums his majesty had at his disposal, over and above all parliamentary grants. The amount of the reserved hereditary revenue of the crown in Scotland, taken on the average of the la6t three-or four years, amounted to 110,000 l. 85 l. l. l.
 Mr. Hume  said, that the right hon. gentleman had observed, that the division of the civil list, in different classes in 1816, had prevented any exceeding. He did not seem to recollect, that, in 1786, there were different classes, which did not prevent an excess. At that time, the expenditure exceeded the estimate by 124,000 l.
 Mr. Hume  said, he was anxious to submit to the House a motion respecting the expenses of the Civil List; and, in the outset, he was able to state, that the objections which the chancellor of the exchequer had made to the proposition of the hon. baronet, would not at all apply to any one of the motions he meant to offer. The House, he was persuaded, from what he had observed this day, would be desirous to obtain all the information possible respecting the income which his late majesty possessed; not only with respect to what parliament granted as a civil list, but also with reference to other exclusive and reserved revenues. The House was aware that in the report now ordered to be printed there was a statement of the total receipts and expenditure of the civil list, from the accession of his late majesty to the month of January, 1815. The object of one of his motions was, to complete that return, and to produce what did not appear from any papers before the House—a return of the expenditure from the 5th of January, 1815, to the 5th of Ja-
 76 l l l l 77 78
 Mr. Huskisson  said, that the right of calling on ministers, under all circumstances, to produce accounts which the hon. gentleman seemed to think existed, was a new doctrine in parliament. He could quote a very high authority on this subject, that of the late Mr. Fox, who had distinctly stated, that, unless the Crown came to parliament for assistance in aid of the civil list, gentlemen were not at liberty to call for an account of its application and expenditure. They had just been told that the estimate had not been exceeded since the last arrangement; and the hon. gentleman observed, that he did not know whether it had or not. A specific allowance had been granted for the support of the king's household; and in the event of an excess beyond that allowance to the amount of 16,000 l. 80
 Sir H. Parnell  rose, to move for certain papers connected with the Civil List, under a conviction that, if the subject were thoroughly examined, a considerable sum might be saved to the country. The present was the only opportunity of enforcing a strict inquiry, because the House was aware that, as soon as the bargain had been completed, the answer would be ready, that the matter was concluded, and that no farther investigation could be had. He was anxious that the report of 1815 should be laid upon the table, that all members might be put in possession of the nature of the settlement of the civil list in the year following: if it could be reprinted, it would be a still greater advantage, as it formed the basis of the present plan. In addition, he wished for papers to show what increase had been made to the civil

 Sir H. Parnell  added, that he would not trouble the House to divide, if that report were reprinted.
 Lord Milton  said, that he also had a petition to present from the merchants, manufacturers, and others interested in the wool trade of Leeds and its neighbourhood, against the wool tax, and praying for its repeal. The character and respectability of the signatures to that petition were the best evidence of the pressure of the evil against which they petitioned. The petition had not originated at a public meeting, because the persons who were most solicitous to press the repeal of that impolitic duty, wished to avoid any course likely to increase the ferment and agitation which existed on this subject in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The tax of which they complained, was not only in contradiction of every principle of political economy, but was directly contrary to that fundamental system of policy which for years had prevailed in this country, and to the continuance of which the faith of parliament was pledged—pledged, he would say, by the immemorial policy of its government—a policy which every statesman who viewed the question would see was the unfailing source of wealth and power. When he reflected also that that duty was imposed on the raw material, the manufacture of which constituted the employment of a great population then suffering under the severest pressure of distress and penury, he must add, that such a measure was not alone impolitic, but cruel and unfeeling. He could moreover state, that as a measure of revenue, it had alto-

 Lord Milton  declared, that he very much doubted if the present circumstances of the country were such as to justify the establishment of a permanent civil list In the present state of our currency, it was impossible for any man to say what was the real value of a pound sterling, or what alteration the execution of the measures agreed to by parliament last year might cause in that value. He would, therefore, almost say, that no permanent civil list establishment ought at present to be formed; but, at least, the House ought maturely to consider on what basis that establishment ought to be constructed. It was half a century since the subject

 Sir W. Curtis,  admitted that after the presentation of the petition, some inquiry into the state of the bridge was necessary, although he believed it was not in the state of danger described.
 Mr. F. Lewis  said, it was highly necessary either that the worthy baronet or some other member should bring the subject before the House, as unless something was promptly introduced a most serious damage would be done to the navigation of the river below the bridge.
 Sir W. Curtis  said, he should consult with the trustees and other parties interested, and bring the subject subsequently under the consideration of parliament.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  said, an inquiry had been going on for some time by the trustees; but he thought his hon. colleague had best leave the introduction of the subject of bringing it before parliament to one of the gentlemen who presented petitions against the present state of the bridge. As one of the trustees of the bridge in right of his corporate character, he declared himself quite prepared for inquiry.
 Mr. Calvert  thought something that essentially affected the fact was kept out of
 92
 Mr. Alderman Wood  assured his hon. friend, that the city had no interest in the water-works, except a small rent, which they would not hesitate to give up.
 Mr. Baring  thought, that a more important subject could not be brought under the consideration of the House. He could not, entirely unconnected as he was with the wool-trade, or with persons embarked in that trade, allow the present opportunity to pass, without saying that he considered this most ancient and valuable manufacture to be in very imminent danger. It could hardly be expected of him to speak more particularly to the subject. He was not exactly prepared to say whether the manufactures of the country could or could not bear this duty of 6 d. 94
 Lord Binning  begged to bear his testimony to the very liberal spirit in which the noble lord met the suggestions of his majesty's government, as to the constitution of the committee.
 The Lord Advocate,  adverting to the conversation which had taken place a few evenings ago in the House on the subject of the appointment of a fourth baron of the exchequer in Scotland, observed, that when the vacancy in question occurred, he had been required, in the discharge of his official duty, to make a report, on the recommendation of the commissioners, on the courts of justice in scotland, to abstain from filling up any such vacancy that might occur after that recommendation. In order the better to enable himself to execute this task, he had submitted the subject to the consideration of the highest law authorities in Scotland, namely, the lord president of the court of session, the lord justice clerk, the lord chief commissioner of the jury court, and the lord chief baron of the exchequer. Those high authorities were unanimous in their opinion as to the expediency of filling up the vacancy. He was solicitous that the House should be put in possession of tin's report; not because it stated the opinion of the humble individual who addressed them, but because it comprehended the opinion of the highest legal authorities in Scotland on the subject. He would therefore move, "That an address be presented to his majesty, praying that he would be graciously pleased to order that there be laid before the House a Copy of the report made by the lord advocate of Scotland on the recommendation contained in the sixth Report of the commissioners on the courts of justice in Scotland, regarding the discontinuance of one of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland."
 Lord Binning  said, that the hon. and learned gentleman spoke as if his learned friend had himself originated the inquiry. It was not so. His learned friend had acted only ministerial. The secretary of state having required a report from his learned friend on the recommendation of the commissioners, he had done his duty by appealing on the subject to the highest law authorities of Scotland.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that he did not rise to oppose the motion; indeed, he had not, with the exception of a slight alteration, any objection to produce the whole of the accounts moved for. He could not, however, help complaining of the uncandid manner in which the hon. member had charged both the governor of Gibraltar and his majesty's council, in the course of his speech, with extravagance and extortion. He did not wish, at present, to go at length into this question, as a proper period would arrive for its discussion. But he hoped members would reserve their opinions until that discussion came fairly before them. With respect to what the hon. member had said relative to the right of the Crown over conquered colonies, he conceived that there was no principle of the law of nations more generally admitted than that which transferred to the conquering sovereign the rights exercised over such colony by that power to which it previously belonged. He did not mean to object to the first or second resolutions; but to the third, he would, if it were not altered, propose an amendment, which was, that the whole account for the time mentioned should be produced, without specifying the items from year to year. He wished at the same time to observe, that there was not any foreign port in which similar duties to those complained of were not exacted. The right hon. member made some observations relative to certain sums remitted from Gibraltar, and received by his late majesty.
 Lord A. Hamilton  said, that having been given to understand that there would be no objection to his motion for the re-appointment of a select committee, to take into consideration the various petitions presented from the royal burghs of Scotland, praying for municipal reformation, he should abstain from offering any observations in support of his motion, taking it for granted that the House concurred in the propriety of the course he was adopting. The report of the last parliament was before the House, and he had only to refer to the information it contained, in order to prove the importance of the measure. If it happened that any hon. gentleman either from reading the report, or from any other cause, should offer any opposition to the motion, he then trusted he should be heard in reply, with the view as far as he was able, to remove the objections. He could assure the House, that the question had excited, and continued to excite, the greatest anxiety throughout that part of the country. Though the list of the committee which he had to propose was not exactly what he wished. As one name had been objected to by his majesty's ministers, yet he was determined to make no opposition to the alteration. The noble lord concluded with moving, that the petitions presented from the royal burghs of Scotland, in the years 1818–19–20, praying
 95
 Mr. Goulburn  complained of the uncandid course that had been taken by the hon. gentleman in bringing forward this question. He protested against the statement which he had made, and which tended to impeach the character of individuals, when merely moving for a return, of the amount of revenue raised at Gibraltar. He protested against such a course, because those charges could not be contradicted at the moment. He hail no difficulty in saying, that, throughout the long reign of his late majesty, every disposition had been shown to attendee the interests of the inhabitants on the one hand, and to support the just rights of
 103
 Mr. Abercromby,  in explanation, observed, that it was substantially the same thing. From whatever source the inquiry proceeded, it was evident that the act of government was in hostility to the opinion of the commissioners. He begged, however, to be distinctly understood, that nothing could be more foreign to his intention than to intimate any thing that was not entirely respectful to the learned lord.
 Mr. Abercromby  rose, not to oppose the motion, but to express his extreme regret that, when a report had been made by commissioners appointed by that House, expressing the opinion of those commissioners, that the office in question should, in the event of a vacancy, not be 611ed up, his majesty should nevertheless have

 Mr. Hume  said, he had, in order to meet the objection of the chancellor of the exchequer, made the alteration which he had suggested in the third motion. That alteration had, however* defeated a very considerable part of the object he had in view, which was, to ascertain the annual amount of revenue collected in a

 Mr. Hume,  before he proceeded to the motion of which he had given notice, wished to correct a mistake that had occurred with reference to one of his statements yesterday evening. He had said that in the seventh class of the civil list in 1815, there was to be found an: expenditure which he had characterised as useless, namely, the sum of 1,372 l. 97 l. l. l. 98 l. l. 99 l. ad libitum, l. 100 101
 Mr. S. Whitbread  presented a petition from the Middlesex watermen of the river Thames, complaining of the great insecurity of London Bridge, the danger that attended life and property, and the interruption it gave to the navigation of the river.
 Mr. T. Wilson  rose, for the purpose of presenting a petition from the manufacturers and merchants concerned in the wool trade of the city of London. Adverting to the duty which was imposed upon foreign wool in the course of last year, the hon. gentleman observed that it appeared to him, from the very first, a proceeding of an unwise and impolitic nature, considering that the manufacturing interest of this country was at that time involved in great distresses, and that a very large number of individuals were suffering under heavy difficulties and privations. He had always felt the truth of the maxim, that the imposition of a new duty upon the raw material was a measure never justifiable, except when the trade was in a flourishing condition. The resolutions which had been founded upon these considerations, and transmitted to his majesty's ministers, were such as, he thought, would make out a very strong case. It was evident that the great price of the raw article would enhance the price of the manufacture in proportion; whereas a fall, such as would be occasioned by the withdrawing of the duty, would enable us to meet the competition of foreign markets. It was very true, as had been stated, that a great number of merchants in the city had refused the order which was transmitted to England for the clothing of the Russian army. The more he had extended his observations, the more information he had been enabled to collect upon the subject, he was so much the more convinced that this tax must operate like a mill-stone round the neck of the manufacturer. He implored his majesty's ministers to consider the state of the country, the condition of the manufacturing classes; and to reflect with how much better grace it would come from them to repeal this tax in pity to
 93
 Mr. Wilson  said, that he intended to follow up the petition, according to the prayer contained in it, by calling the serious attention of the House to the subject. But he should let the petition rest at present, until the House was in possession of numerous others upon the same subject, which he expected would be forwarded from all parts of the country.
 Colonel Dalrymple  said, the inhabitants of Gibraltar were, for the most part, Roman Catholics, Genoese, or foreigners of that description, and Jews; an extensive church was not, therefore, necessary. But there was a Protestant place of worship, and he had attended church for two years. In that edifice there was no want of room for those who pleased to attend divine service. He did not think that the garrison of Gibraltar would thank the hon. gentleman, if they were hurthened with a tax for the erection of a church. There were other inaccuracies in the statement of the hon. gentleman, which, at a proper period, he would point out.
 Sir J. Mackintosh,  having had occasion to know something of the administration of affairs in Gibraltar, and being acquainted with certain circumstances relating to the mode of making impositions on the inhabitants, could not but say that their rights had not been treated with that regard and respect which in justice should have been extended to them. At the same time, he meant to admit, that his majesty's government, in the revision of the Order in council, to which allusion had been made; had manifested a very commendable anxiety to do all they could to rectify a measure which he looked upon as improvident and bad; He could not, however, agree in the interpretation of the law of nations: which had been given by the right hon. gentleman and which, falling from a per-
 102
 Sir J. Newport  supported the necessity of an inquiry into the constitution of the court of exchequer in Scotland. It was evident that the information which was to be afforded on the subject, was absolutely forced from government by the observations made by his noble friend.
 Mr. Marryat  rose to state some facts which had come under his own knowledge respecting the droits of the Crown in conquered colonies. In Trinidad, the owners of land had been required to take out new grants for their lands, with burthens attached to which they had never before been subject. He saw by the Trinidad gazette that 4,800 acres of land were offered, to sale on the part, of the Crown, being confiscated under the new regulation. These confiscations had taken place in the only two parishes which had yet been surveyed for the purposes of the new regulation, out of the 32 parishes in the island. If the others yielded confiscations in the same proportion, there would be 155,000 acres in the whole island. What this land would sell for it was not easy to ascertain; if for 4 l. l.
 Mr. Wynn  said, it was his intention to detain the House only for a few moments.
 148
 Mr. Macdonald  said, that after all which had been heard from time to time on the subject of economy, after the many promises which had been made, it might have been reasonably supposed that the present period would be one when something would be done for the benefit of the people. If such a supposition had been entertained, was it not, he would ask, borne out by the promises of Mr. Perceval at the commencement of the regency, and by the statements (he would not call them pledges) of the noble lord opposite, in 1816, that the demise of the Grown would be the proper period for such a measure as was now proposed? But, at the arrival of that period, it was little to be expected that the surveyor, of woods and forests, and the paymaster of the forces would be found to say that it was a matter of delicacy now, and ought not to be entered into. Nevertheless, the fact seemed to be, that at the period that those promises were given and those hopes held out, no revision or alteration was intend-

 Mr. Bathurst  contended, that it was a fallacy to say that the motion of the hon. and learned gentleman was a motion merely to obtain information; The object of the motion was not merely to inquire into the amount of the droits of the Admiralty and the other funds, but to re-
 159
 Mr. Tierney  said, he would make a few observations on the state of the question, and the engagement to which voting on one side or the other would pledge the members of the House. He could assure the House and the gentlemen opposite, who were so anxious to bring this debate to a conclusion, that he should not detain them long. After the able speech of his hon. and learned friend, in which the whole facts and law of the case had been stated and supported; after the speech of the right hon. gentleman opposite, and the reply of his hon. and learned friend near him, the merits of the question required no farther discussion. He rose, therefore, not to add any thing to what had been already said on the question itself, but to set members right on the real purport of the motion. The House, then, was now called upon at the beginning of a new reign, to make a final arrangement of the civil list for the whole of that reign. On such an occasion it was necessary to make the most minute inquiry, and to exert the most scrupulous caution to make the arrangement as wise and proper as it would be lasting. When a new settlement was proposed, it was incumbent on the House to take into consideration all the funds at present at the disposal of the Crown, in order to know what charges should be made before that settlement was effected. If they now neglected to do so, another opportunity would not again occur during the reign. When a motion like this should be afterwards brought forward, it would be sufficient to say, that the matter had been already settled, and thus alt further consideration of it would be shut out. The proposed resolution went no further than this, that it was expedient to take into consideration the droits of the Admiralty, the 4½ per cent colonial duties, and other funds usually at the disposal of the Crown, with the making of such an arrangement concerning them as would be consistent with the maintenance of the dignity of the Crown, and the interests of the country. Those, therefore, who should vote for his hon. and learned friend's motion would pledge themselves to no principle on the subject—they would merely express an opinion that the system formerly acted upon, now that a new arrangement was to be made, ought to be taken into consideration. Any gentleman who voted against it would say by his vote, that parliament ought to give the subject

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he had not intended to address the House on the question had it not been for some observations of the right hon. gentleman. The House would see, in the contrariety of the opinions of the hon. gentlemen opposite, what good a committee was likely to do. Three or four of these hon. gentlemen had spoken on this question, and none of them could be brought to see it in the same light. They all disagreed, not only, with his side of the House, but with themselves. Ministers proposed to continue a system which had been four years in operation, and which was better understood by experience than any of the new-fashioned, new-fangled plans of the gentlemen opposite. It possessed about it some of the venerable characters of antiquity. This system had been shown to be good on a four years trial. It was framed on a scale of reduction to the amount of 135,000 l. l. l. 158
 Mr. Canning  began by observing, that if any stranger had entered the House during the last few sentences of the hon.
 128 129 130 131 132 l. l. l; l. l.; l.: l. § 133 134 l. 135 136 137 summum bonum 138
 Mr. Canning  admitted that the explanation made the argument quite different; but the reference to the Smyrna fleet appeared to him to go a little further.
 Mr. Brougham  explained, that the right hon. gentleman must have misapprehended him, or, in common policy, he would not have so far misrepresented what he had said. He had not supposed that the droits occasioned war. No king nor House of Commons would ever be so mad as to go to war for the sake of droits of the Admiralty. What he had said, and
 139
 Mr. Brougham  said, that in rising to bring before the House the important subject of which he had given notice,—important, in so far as it was inseparably connected with the question of the civil list,—he trusted they would give him credit, when he assured them it was very far from his intention to trespass more than was absolutely necessary upon their time and attention. They would be the more disposed so to give him credit, when he begged leave to remind them that the bringing forward this question upon the present occasion was in reality none of his seeking. But he stood pledged to submit it to their consideration, and particularly] by what passed in 1812, in case his majesty's ministers should think proper to omit it in their arrangements. He appealed to the recollection of honourable gentlemen, whether he had not given that notice, or rather whether he had not been driven

 Mr. Brougham  rose to reply. He said he should be the less excusable in farther trespassing on the indulgence of the House, both because he had occupied so much of their time in opening the question, and because so little had been urged on the other side; and that little had been so triumphantly answered by his hon. friend near him (sir J. Mackintosh), and on the bench behind (Mr. Macdonald). He could, not retort upon the gentlemen opposite the sarcasm of the chancellor of the exchequer, on him and his friends that they differed from one another and from themselves, each varying from his fellow, and no one consistent with himself. The minister had found out the most easy and effectual method of protecting themselves from such a sneer—at least, from the greater part of it—a method as obvious as it was simple, and as efficacious as it was obvious; it consisted in none of them speaking at all except one. Accordingly all kept silence, save the president of the board of control, and. be not being in a condition to differ with his companions, had only been able to exemplify the other branch of his friend's zeal by contradicting himself. But the silence of some gentlemen on this occasion surprised and disappointed him more than that of others. Upon a great, legal, and constitutional question—one touching the rights of the sovereign, and involving at every turn, as was said, the honour and dignity of the throne, how happened it that the House lacked the two chief law officers of the Crown, the attorney and solicitor-general—the props and pillars of the prerogative—the sworn defenders of the sanctuary—the  tutamen, decus, 160 161 tirade, 162 163
 Mr. Benett  presented a petition, signed by upwards of 6,000 persons, chiefly clothiers, clothworkers and manufacturers of Wiltshire (as a proof of the respectability of whom, the hon. member said, that among the names were those of eleven magistrates, one of whom was the chairman of the quarter sessions), complaining of the number of manufacturers who, in consequence of the introduction of machinery and other causes, had been driven out of work, and were compelled to have recourse for subsistance to the parochial rates. He could assure the House that this petition did not proceed from any political motive. There was no radical feeling in Wiltshire. Among the manufacturers of that county, numerous as they were, there existed no inclination to encourage sedition, or to obtain a remedy for the evils which they suffered, except by legal means. He hoped, therefore, that this petition would be favourably received by the House; and, however difficult the subject, that the House would feel the necessity of taking every possible means of mitigating the distress experienced, not only by the petitioners, but by the agricultural labourers, who looked to parliament for some alleviation of their case.—The petition was ordered to be printed.
 Mr. W. Smith  highly approved of what had been said by his hon. and learned friend concerning the expedition of sir Home Popham. Adverting to the subject of the civil-list, the hon. gentleman observed, that he conceived it a settled custom to arrange it at the commencement of a new reign. Such an arrangement of it had been contemplated by the commit* tee of 1816. Those, therefore, who opposed on the present inquiry occasion differed from the recommendation of that committee. Nothing was proposed by the present motion but an examination which the report then made contemplated, and he therefore called upon the authors of that report to support his hon. and learned friend.
 Sir James Mackintosh  said, that if he chose his station in debate otherwise than from a sense of duty, most assuredly he should not have taken the station which brought him so nearly into contact with the great and powerful speech of the statesman and lawyer who introduced the subject, nor that which called upon him to reply to the eloquence and talents of his right hon. friend who had just sat down. Considering the speech of his hon. and learned friend as consisting wholly of reason and knowledge, and entirely free from objections usually made in that House—considering that it discussed exclusively a great and grave question of state policy, without turning it at all into a means of acquiring popularity or an instrument of inflammation, he could not regard the observations which he was now to attempt to answer but as ingenious fallacies. One of the topics urged by his right hon. friend—he could not call it argument, although it was a topic often used with effect, and its general effect he did not wish to lessen—was the reverence for feudal monarchy and gothic government, the charge of stripping the Crown of its trappings, and the monarch of his dignity. This topic was inapplicable altogether on the present occasion; for the speech of his hon. and learned friend expressed as strong a regard for the law, for the constitution, for the honour and dignity of the Crown, as any speech that had ever been Uttered in that House. His right hon. friend ought to view feudal monarchy as connected with all its evils, with the baneful and oppressive evils which were gradually removed during four centuries—from Magna Charta to the statute of Wards and Liveries. This was the olden time so warmly eulogized! This was an attempt at celebrating the golden age of old times, which he thought more suitable to a venerable major nut of doors, than to his right hon. friend [a laugh and cheers]. The bold

 Sir Joseph Yorke  agreed with the hon. and learned mover, in the account he had given of the Souchong and Congo expedition of a gallant admiral. He always rejoiced at an opportunity of supporting ministers; but on the present occasion, unless the chancellor of the exchequer or any of his hon. friends around him could give a better reason than had hitherto been assigned for the grant to that gallant admiral, he should vote for the motion.
 Sir Robert Wilson  concurred with his hon. and learned friend who had made the motion, that there was not an officer engaged in the capture of the Spanish vessels who did not think his professional character tarnished by the transaction. He might mention another evil arising out of these captures before a declaration of war. After the peace of Amiens an order was given to seize and detain French vessels, and the consequence was, that the French government retaliated by detaining all the English who were at the time within the dominions of France. This measure of the French government was by many justified, on the ground that it was a proper return for such previous treatment. The gallant general concluded by saying that he should vote for the motion [The cry of "Question!" became general].
 Sir J. Newport  said, that as he considered that the power which the present system would give to the Crown was open to great abuse, he should vote for the resolutions. With respect to the revenue of four-and-half per cent, it was said that it was intended for the service of the colonies, the erection of fortifica-

 Mr. Philips  argued, that the right hon. gentleman had made liberal admissions,
 186
 Mr. Robinson  stated, in answer, that he did not know if to be the intention of his majesty's government to take any such step. The notice, of the noble lord might therefore stand as proposed.
 Mr. Baring  said, he had the honour to rise for the purpose of presenting from a most extensive and respectable body, the merchants of London. Whether he adverted to the terms, in which their petition was couched, to the respectability? of the gentlemen by whom it was signed, or if the peculiar circumstances of the country

 Mr. Grenfell  said, that after the able and eloquent speech of his hon. friend, it would be idle in him to attempt entering into the subject. But as it was a subject upon which he had before delivered his opinions, he hoped he might be allowed to express his opinion upon it now; and he assured the House that in doing so he should not take up much of their time. He begged then to state, that he gave his humble, but most hearty concurrence in every principle contained in the petition, and so ably advocated by the hon. mover; and he begged to add, that in the House, or out of the House, he would give its principles his most zealous and active co-operation.
 Mr. Baring  considered the difference in this respect as more theoretical than it I would be found in practice. He had never found the variation to be so great as was apprehended; and as, upon his hon. friend's own admission, the payments in both metals would afford a facility which could not be other wise acquired, bethought that plan preferable.
 Mr. Tierney  said, that this discussion came on under circumstances of a nature perfectly unparalleled. It regarded the appropriation of a sum of 850,000 l. 212 l. l., 213 l. 214 l., l. l. l. l., l., 215 l. l. l. 216 l. l. l. 217 l. l. l. l. l. l. 218 l. l., l. l. l. l., l. l. l. l. l. 219 l. l. 220 l. 221
 Mr. Tierney  denied that he had wished to examine into the mode in which the privy purse was expended. As he did not intend to trouble the House with his motion to-morrow, he might be allowed to add, though not within the strict limits of explanation, that, from the statement of the right hon. gentleman, it appeared that the 110,000 l. 226 l
 Mr. Marryat,  after complimenting the petitioners and different members of the House, for the liberal ideas which they had expressed, entered into some statements as to the commercial advantages which this country enjoyed from its colonies. By the restrictions imposed on them, and the manner in which the intercourse was carried on with them, they were made to contribute most largely towards the prosperity of the mother country: they were limited to an intercourse with us alone: their produce was imported in British ships, and paid for in British manufactures.
 Mr. Baring  said, that there was one point of importance on which he had the misfortune totally to differ with his hon. friend (Mr. Ricardo); on that point, as on every other, he would differ with him with reluctance and with diffidence. When his hon. friend stated that the difference in the currency was but as 3 l. s. l. s. l. l. s. 196 197
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that before he moved the second reading of the resolutions, he should shortly explain the circumstances under which they were offered to their consideration. In doing so, he should have lamented if it had been necessary to trouble the House with that infinite mass of voluminous details which at former times it had been necessary to investigate. The object of those who had on former occasions offered those details to parliament was, either to explain the manner in which deficiencies had arisen in the civil list, and to exculpate those who had had the management of it, or to form the ground of some new system. Neither of those causes now called upon him for any observations He had no deficiencies to account for, because none had occurred since the last arrangement of the civil list, and he had no new system to propose, because the system then adopted had been found perfectly effectual. In comparing that last establishment in 1816, with the former arrangements, it was necessary to remark that at four former times had parliament made payment of the debts of the civil list, and four times without accounts or investigation on the mere statement of the fact in a message from the Crown—and thus four times had voted a permanent increase of the civil list. In 1782, a very considerable improvement in the civil list arrangements took place, and permanent rules were laid down for the administration its revenues. It was thus the civil list charges were divided into classes, to be paid in regular succession, and on this principle it was hoped that such, a system of economy would be carried into practice, as would prevent the recurrence of embarrassments. If Mr. Burke, the illustrious author of that bill, had gone a little farther, his hopes would probably have been well founded; but though he divided the ordinary expenditure into classes, a power was given to make occasional payments to any amount. Though no limits were set to the contingent expenses, there was no deficiency in the civil list thenceforward, till the breaking out of the French war—but after that; all the contingent expenses were so increased, that there was an arrear of 900,000 l. 199 l. l. 200 l. l. l.
 Lord John Russell  said, it was with considerable pain, that, on an occasion of a grant such as the present, he felt it his duty to move that this report be taken into further consideration at a future day. This he did with the view of its coming before a select committee. It would have given him much pleasure if his majesty's ministers had taken this latter part of the task upon themselves, because it would best have come from them. He felt, also, doubts of the success of his motion, when he found that neither the learning, the wit, nor the eloquence of his hon. and learned friend (Mr. Brougham) were successful in an appeal on the subject the other evening. His motion, however, had one advantage which did not belong to that which was submitted by his hon. and learned friend—that it was not complex in its nature, nor intricate in the immediate question to which it referred. The question to which he wished to call the attention of the House was simply this—whether they, the representatives of the people, just returned from the people, with their professions and promises still on their lips, would, in a new parliament, take estimates into which they had made no inquiry, on which they
 201 202 l. l. l., l. 203 204
 Mr. Ricardo,  in explanation, stated that he had never imagined that the currency had never been depreciated more than 4 per cent. He had merely contended, that at the time when the subject was taken up by parliament in the last year, there was only that depreciation; which was too small to warrant an alteration of the ancient standard. He was well aware that during some of the latter years of the war, the depreciation had been as great as 25 per cent.
 Mr. Ricardo  said, he would take that opportunity of making an observation as to the two standards of gold and silver. He fully agreed with his hon. friend, that a payment in both would facilitate the payment of the public creditor; but then there was a question whether two stand ards would not be more liable to fluctuation than one invariable standard. If payment were made in one metal, it would be liable to less fluctuation than if made; in two, and in two it would be less than if made in three; therefore he considered the payment in one metal as preferable, being liable to less fluctuation.
 Mr. Ricardo  begged the noble lord to recollect, that at the time when he spoke on the bullion question last session the price of gold was at 4 l. s. l. s. 1. s. 192 193
 Mr. Ellice,  after a few observations in reply to Mr. Ricardo, said, that since the return to cash payments was finally settled, to the present time, every staple article or produce connected with manufactures had experienced a fall of from 30 to 50 per cent; the only articles exempt from the operation of that system were agricultural produce, and that was kept up by the protection of the corn laws. With respect to the petition before the House, he entirely agreed in the objects proposed, and he was willing to give the fullest credit to the professions made that night by the right hon. the president of the board of trade, to concur in the propositions that petition contained. But, unfortunately, the state of the debt and the finances, rendered it impossible, without some great alteration, for the House to pay much attention to the petition before them. When they considered the state of the public debt, when they knew how the right hon. gentleman opposite would be reminded by his right hon. friend the chancellor of the exchequer of the loss to the revenue which would follow an alteration in the system, they would, he feared, but deceive the country, if they were to encourage hopes of any great advantage being likely to be derived from the present petition, or the system, however admirable, which it suggested. There were other consideration? which ought to be met. His hon. friend who presented the petition had stated that a number of Gentle-

 Mr. F. Robinson  said, that as no other gentleman seemed disposed to rise, he felt it necessary to offer a few observations on the question so ably introduced by the hon. mover. He hoped the hon. member and the House would do him the justice to believe that he was fully sensible of the extreme importance of the subject before them. He had always given it as his opinion, that the restrictive system of commerce in this country was founded

 Mr. Canning  said, that all the points urged in the course of the debate were resolvable into a few plain, simple, propositions. The House was now called upon to do what had been done at the commencement of every former reign, namely, to vote a civil list for the support of the civil government and household of the sovereign. Under such circumstances the first step to he taken was, to examine the precedents of good times—he meant such as were regarded by all men with satisfaction. Going back to the Revolution, it was found that the vote of the civil list from the reign of king William to George 3rd, had been carried in this House in the first instance without minute investigation; and the only inference he wished to draw from this fact was, not that the House was bound to follow implicitly the course of precedents, but that those who proposed a deviation were bound to show the special circumstances that rendered it advisable. If it could be shown that in the course of the last reign there had been no examination into these matters, or that from the lapse of time it was possible that abuses had crept in, it might form some ground for the present proposal. If, on the other hand, it could be proved, that although an investigation, both minute and recent, had taken place, yet that since that date there had been great exceedings on the part of the Crown, a manifest want of economy, or an application for an increase, then some ground would perhaps be laid for a deviation from the ordinary precedent. But when these things had

 Mr. Brougham  said, he was really sorry at that hour to detain the House, and perhaps owed some apology for again claiming its attention; but he thought proper to offer a few words in explanation of some observations of his, which had been greatly misunderstood by the right hon. gentleman who had just sat down. He was most unwilling to allow the House, or even the right hon. gentleman himself (who, he trusted, was the only person who, hearing what be had said, had so misunderstood him), to go away under an impression so wide of his real meaning as

 Mr. Stuart Wortley  said, he had the honour to present a petition from the merchants and manufacturers in Wool, of Huddersfield and its neighbourhood, against the late duty imposed on foreign wool. The petitioners stated, and he believed justly, that, as an effect of that impolitic tax, a considerable quantity of capital had been sent out of the country. A noble friend of his intended to give that night a notice of a motion for its repeal. Till that discussion he should defer further observation on the effects of a tax whose further continuance he so much deprecated.
 Mr. Warre  seconded the amendment, and said, that when the committee of 1816 was appointed, it was deprived of the very life and essence of a committee of inquiry. When his right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney) proposed that it should be allowed to send for persons, papers, and records, his proposition was negatived; and when a proposal was made to call before the committee an efficient officer of the lord Steward's department, it was rejected. The committee had nothing to proceed upon; they were obliged to trust implicitly to papers delivered to them from the different departments. Into the grounds on which those papers were formed, they were not allowed to inquire. He could not, therefore, rely upon the accuracy of those statements, or upon the correctness of those calculations, to which the chancellor of the exchequer appeared to think the House so peculiarly bound to attend. He was by no means disposed to countenance any denunciation against the splendor of royalty.
 205
 Mr. Beaumont  concurred in the principles laid down by the hon. mover. Much of the evil under which the country now laboured might be traced to her commercial system, and the sooner it was improved the better. It was a fit subject for the interference of his majesty's ministers. When it was recollected that the right hon. the president of the board of trade, had so unequivocally expressed his opinion against the present restrictive system, that fact alone was sufficiently strong to require the interference of ministers, and to induce them to promote, by all practical means, the objects suggested by the petitioners.
 Mr. T. Wilson  said, he could not but concur with the hon. gentleman who spoke last but one, that in the present
 195
 Mr. W. Douglas  said, he very much lamented that on a question like that before the House, there should be heard the least expression of any thing like party feeling. He was convinced that it could not be the wish of the petitioners to take any other view, but to represent to parliament what they really thought to be the sound principles of political economy, and to show how far the restrictive system of trade was contrary to those principles. Those alone were the objects of the petitioners; and he begged to express his entire concurrence in the sentiments of the hon. mover. He was happy to hear the right hon. the president of the broad of trade express his concurrence in those sentiments; but still he could not help feeling disappointment at some parts of that speech. The right hon. gentleman concurred in the views of the petitioners. He considered them important and desirable; but although a similar petition had been presented at the conclusion of the last session of parliament, and though the right hon. gentleman then, as now, professed sentiments friendly to those objects, yet he did not point out what practical alterations might be made; he did not say what specific plan might be

 Mr. Huskisson  said, he had always thought that there was great difficulty in discussing this question, because, from the terms in which they expressed themselves, it appeared as if there were opposite and conflicting interests at stake. But he was sure that every person who carefully directed his attention to the subject, would perceive that the civil list involved the general interests of the state. In the first parliament of a new reign, such an inquiry as that proposed by the noble lord was likely to be received with great favour. But he would tell the noble lord, that, in the practice of former reigns, there was no precedent for such an inquiry. There was nothing in the circumstances of the late demise, or the present accession, which could be urged as a reason for taking the civil list out of its ordinary course. The amount of the expenditure necessary for supporting the dignity of the Crown, and defraying the charges of the civil government, was not necessarily changed by the demise of one sovereign, and the accession of another. On the present occasion, indeed, there were circumstances which, even admitting that precedents were in favour of the noble lord's motion, would induce the House to deviate from such a course. When the noble lord talked of the groom of the stole, his answer to the noble lord was, that the groom of the stole belonged to his late majesty, and that the saving arising from the termination of that office would be carried to the account of the public; for the whole of the Windsor establishment terminated on the demise of the late

 Mr. W. Smith  thought that the price of one would act as a corrective on the other. He therefore preferred the plan of payments in both.
 Lord Milton  said, he had heard the petition before the House read with great pleasure; he had listened too with much satisfaction to the speech of the hon. member who brought it forward. If any thing indeed in the present distressed state of the country, could give satisfaction, it was that of hearing the sound principles of political economy and the liberal principles of commerce embraced by so respectable a body of men as the merchants and traders of London. But that was not the only satisfaction which he had experienced in the course of the debate. The speech of the right hon. the president of the board of trade would have increased the satisfaction he felt on the present occasion, were it not for the little alloy which was too apparent in it. To him it appeared, that the principles and the conduct of the right hon. gentleman were not in unison. He had expressed very excellent principles, but when he came to explain his conduct, and the conduct of the government with whom he acted, he was not

 Lord Milton  said, he wished to put a question to the right hon. the president of the board of trade. He wished to know from him, whether it was the intention of his majesty's government to repeal the late duty on wool? If such an intention was entertained, it would afford him the greatest satisfaction, and in their hands he would gladly leave it. If, on the contrary, they were not disposed to take that course, he rose for the purpose of giving notice that on Tuesday next he should move for the repeal of the late duty on foreign wool.

 Lord John Russell  rose for the purpose of submitting to the House the motion of which he had given notice, for leave to bring in a bill to exclude the borough of Grampound from sending members to parliament, and to enable the borough of Leeds to assume that privilege. In doing so, he would shortly trouble the House with his views on the subject. He had in the course of last session stated his own opinion of the propriety of disfranchising the borough of Grampound, or any other borough similarly situated, and of extending the franchise thus forfeited to large towns or populous districts. When he stated this opinion, it was, he
 238 l. l., l. 239
 Lord J. Russell  said, it was not his intention to call for any further proceeding. The inquiry last year rendered it unnecessary.
 Lord J. Russell  wished to observe, that it was necessary to introduce in the bill then before the House the name of some place to which the elective franchise was to be transferred. He had no objection to granting the franchise any other borough. The right hon. gentleman must know, that when bills were brought in respecting other boroughs in which bribery and corruption had prevailed, the title of those bills was "a bill for preventing bribery and corruption in such a borough." It was quite impossible to give such a title to the bill, which did not go to prevent bribery and corruption for the future in Grampound, but to deprive it entirely of its franchises. With respect to the admission that was made in the last session
 241
 Mr. D. Gilbert  perfectly agreed in the observation, that it would be very inexpedient, where several boroughs were disfranchised, to extend the rights thus forfeited to any one place.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, the only answer he could give the noble lord was, that, undoubtedly it would become necessary to propose to parliament to make a provision for the queen, as well as for several other branches of the royal family. The subject would soon be brought under the consideration of parliament.
 Mr. Alderman Wood,  in rising to bring forward his motion relative to Edwards, who was said to be connected with the Cato-street conspiracy, begged to assure the House that he had no other end or object in view than that of public justice. Before he gave notice of this motion, he had done every thing in his power, by application to the Secretary of state for the home department, to have this individual brought to trial. The information which he possessed came to his knowledge in his magisterial capacity. He laid the documents before lord Sidmouth, and offered to bring forward, for examination at his office, the different witnesses upon whose testimony they were made out. His representations not having been acted upon, he felt it his duty to bring the subject before parliament. He had looked over the depositions of more than thirty persons, and those documents which he held in his hand he should feel it necessary to read at length to the House, unless his motion for a committee was granted [a laugh]. He assured the House that he had not the slightest wish to occupy their attention more than was absolutely necessary. If the House would allow the appointment of a select committee, he would undertake to satisfy them of the facts which he had to allege against this man, Edwards. This was a question of a grave and serious nature, and called for their most patient

 Mr. Grenfell. —I beg to know on what authority the hon. alderman is proceeding. Were these affidavits? Was this evidence taken on oath?
 Mr. Bennet  conceived this interruption to be uncalled for.
 Mr. Wynn  observed, that unauthenticated papers could not be read except with the permission of the House.
 Mr. Grenfell. —I wish, for my own information, and that of the House, to know on what authority this evidence rests.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  answered, that these documents were copies of depositions, many of which had been laid before lord Sidmouth, and were signed by the persons who gave the evidence. Those individuals were ready to swear to the truth of their statements. William Coudry stated that he attended several meetings when Edwards was present, and was informed by him, on one occasion, that a cabinet dinner was to be given at lord Westmoreland's, at which lord Castlereagh would be present. Edwards said, "the b—y Irish butcher must be made away with." Coudry stated also that he had often seen Edwards afterwards, and he was always preparing destructive instruments, Seymour staled, that he knew Edwards four or five, years. He met him some time ago, and he proposed that deponent should go to a meeting in Smithfield. He replied to Edwards that he would not go, for that he was not inclined to join in those bad pranks. Edwards afterwards told this man that the meeting had not turned out to their expectation. This, the hon. alderman observed, was a man of considerable respectability. Another man had seen Edwards at a coffeehouse, in June, and was told by him that the only means was, to destroy his majesty's ministers by throwing hand-gre-

 Mr. Bankes  said, that such a motion ought to be supported either by some case of precedent, or some analogy in other times; or it ought to be founded on the urgent necessity of the case. The worthy alderman had not established any grounds applicable to either of those descriptions. The motion was totally inconsistent with every thing he understood constantly to belong to the functions of that House. It was a motion for a secret committee to inquire into the degree of criminality in an individual person. Anything so extraordinary, so anomalous, as the degree of criminality in an individual, he had never heard proposed for inquiry in that House. He had always expressed, when inquiries of certain kinds were proposed, how cautious the House should be in tradeing on judicial grounds. Judicial inquiries could never be conducted by that House, either with honour to itself, or success in eliciting truth. What powers had that House for the purpose of judicial inquiry? Was there any thing of so little weight as evidence given either at the bar, or before a committee of that
 252 253 254 255
 Mr. Hobhouse  addressed the House for the first time, as follows:—
 Mr. Wynn  said, that for the number of years that he had sat in the House, he had never heard a motion brought forward on such extraordinary grounds as the present, unless it was, indeed, the former motion of the hon. alderman to proceed against an individual for a breach of privilege, which consisted in a plan to blow up the House; on which ground, he supposed, Guy Fawkes must also have been guilty of a breach of privilege. It had been said, that in similar cases, when his majesty's ministers had to complain of machinations against themselves, similar committees had been appointed. He had never heard of any such committees appointed on account of machinations against the ministers—they were not appointed to gratify the curiosity of the public, but always, as far as his experience went, to lay the ground of legislative proceedings. Who were the witnesses in this case? Men, no one of whom had done the duty of loyal subjects, and given information of the nefarious designs which had been unbosomed to them. It was said this did not lessen the guilt of Edwards, but did it not lessen their credibility? The case was, there was a plot, of which this person had given information. Was it not likely that those who were implicated in that plot and not tried, would, out of policy, as those who were found guilty would, from revenge, seek to invalidate the testimony, and discredit the character of the informer? Was it not common in
 264
 The Attorney General  said, the grounds on which the hon. and learned gentleman had proposed to vote for the motion of the worthy alderman were new, and wholly distinct from those on which the hon. members who preceded him had given it their support. The worthy alderman in bringing forward his motion proposed to inquire into the conduct of Edwards, but disclaimed all intention of imputing blame to the government for the use they had made of that person. His hon. and learned friend supported the motion on the ground that the government was wrong in employing him, which: he had assumed without a tittle of proof, and; then he came to the conclusion that he had seduced the late conspirators into the commission of that crime for which they had suffered. He would state that Edwards had never been employed by the government as a spy, and it was not in that character that he furnished that information which had enabled ministers to defeat one of the most horrible plots that had ever been formed. He would ask his hon. and learned friend, if he could suppose that Edwards had seduced Thistlewood and his associates, after reading

 Sir Francis Burdelt  said, that he should occupy the attention of the House but for a very short time. If ever a speech was made which tended to support a motion it was meant to oppose, it was the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down. If all was so clear as he had insisted, where could be the objection to adopting an inquiry, in order to satisfy the doubts which existed in the public mind. If the whole country agreed in taking the same view that the attorney-general had expressed, they might then say with truth that there ought to be no inquiry; but when the public mind was strongly agitated with very different impressions, no simple vote of the House of Commons, nothing but substantial proof, nothing but accurate investigation could satisfy them, whatever statements the attorney-general might offer to their consideration. He had given one reason, which, was in itself a powerful argument against his own advice; lie had stated that there were other persons, and those not few, connected with the conspiracy—persons of importance and wealth in the country. Such was the way in which he understood the hon. and learned gentleman, and if that was his meaning, the propriety of going into a committee could no longer be denied. The hon. and learned gentleman had stated other points in which he was not borne out by fact. There could be no doubt as to the object of the unhappy persons engaged in the conspiracy, or as to the
 275 276 277 278
 Sir F. Burdett  rose to explain. He by no means meant to reply to the many stupid, absurd, and senseless exaggerations which the right hon. gentleman had been guilty of with regard to his (sir F. Burdett's) sentiments. In the list of his absurdities it had been represented that if his own house were on fire, and the lives of his own family dependent on the steps he should take in such a case he would hesitate to receive, or to act upon the information of an accomplice in the mischief! He had only blamed government for keeping in constant pay a regular set of spies, who insidiously went about the country for the purpose of fomenting discontents and planning conspiracies in order to inveigle the unwary into the snares of the law. He would not retract what he had said; and under this explanation he would repeat that the right hon. gentleman's logic was most absurd, ridiculous, and senseless.
 Sir F. Burdett  begged pardon for such frequent interruptions, but, before the discussion proceeded, he should like to hear from the right hon. gentleman, what he meant when he said his (sir F. Burdett's) "man?" The right hon. gentler man he thought was full of levity that night. He had accused a worthy alderman of being drunk with popularity; but> for his part, he thought the right hon. gentleman was himself drunk with insolence.
 The Attorney General,  in explanation, stated, that in saying the late conspirators were supplied with money from other quarters, hp by no means intended to allude to any persons of particular consequence. But those persons who gave the money were fully known to government; and when he expressed a wish that they should be aware of that fact, he meant that it should be communicated to them through the usual channels, by which the public became acquainted with the public became acquainted with the proceedings of the House.
 Mr. Alderman Wood,  that as he had been charged in a very unhandsome manner by a right hon. gentle-
 290 291
 Sir F. Burdett  then rose, and stated, that he considered it his duty to say what he did. It occurred to him that the right hon. gentleman had said, that the worthy alderman was drunk with popularity [a cry of No, no!]. He did not mean to say that the right hon. gentleman used the express words, but certainly he took the meaning to be, that the worthy alderman was intoxicated with popularity. The words he used in consequence of that impression were not intended to be personal.
 Lord A. Hamilton  rose
 242
 Lord A. Hamilton  observed, that, if it were determined to take away the elective franchise from Grampound, he could suggest places in that part of the country with which he was more intimately connected to which it might be extended with advantage.
 Mr. Canning  said, that as it, had been distinctly understood in the last session of the last parliament, that the noble, lord who now introduced this measure should not be in the smallest degree prejudiced in again bringing forward the subject, so far as this proceeding might have been prejudiced by the dissolution of the last, and the formation of a new parliament, that circumstance would be amply sufficient to justify any individual who might wish to oppose the introduction of this bill in abstaining from pursuing that course. He, however, felt no such inclination. He was perfectly disposed, on his own part, and on the part of those with whom he acted, to see the noble lord's bill brought before the House for discussion. And so far as the acknowledgment of the principle, that a borough convicted of gross bribery and corruption, such as in former times would produce an order for disfranchisement, went, he was ready to say that to such disfranchisement, in such a proved case, he had no objection. So far would he go. But he was sure it was not necessary to appeal to the noble lord's candour for the preservation of any ulterior opinion as to the mode in which the franchise, so taken away, should be disposed of; because he was convinced the noble lord would recollect that, in the last session of parliament, the introduction of the town of Leeds rested solely on his own will and opinion, without any previous concert or understanding, expressed or implied, with any other persons, as to the propriety of selecting that particular place. No person, he believed, but the noble mover himself, was cognizant of the place to which he wished to transfer the franchise. When the bill came regularly before the House for discussion, he should be prepared to enter into all the considerations that he longed to it. He was at present only desirous that the consent which, individually,
 240
 Mr. Canning,  after complimenting his hon. and learned friend on the manner in which he had again brought forward this important subject, proceeded to say, that although he certainly should not object to the present motion, it must not be considered that any man, by acceding to it, was pledged to entertain any further proceeding. He should be happy to see the purposes for which his hon. and learned friend wished the appointment of the committee fully developed; and he could assure him, that no objection would be made on his part to any ulterior proposition, for objection's sake; or unless there should appear to be some solid and substantial ground for doubting its expediency.
 Mr. Canning  observed, that the hon. baronet saw and heard not only what was, but also what was not. He distinctly disavowed having used the expression that the worthy alderman was "drunk with popularity." As to his having given to an hon. friend of the hon. baronet's the title of the hon. baronet's "man," it was an expression which he had met with in some speeches made in Westminster during the late vacation, and which he had read in the same way as the hon. baronet might perhaps have read his (Mr. Canning's) speeches on a similar occasion at Liverpool.
 Mr. Canning  answered in the negative, adding, that he was not conscious of making such an observation as would imply that he believed in the existence of any approbation of a doctrine that might be as inconvenient to their successors, as to those who at present held the offices alluded to.
 Mr. Canning  did not think he had misrepresented the hon. baronet. He did not think so before the hon. baronet last rose: nor did the explanation of the hon. baronet alter his opinion. He had never said that the hon. baronet contended for the rejection of evidence after detection.
 Mr. Canning  was so satisfied with the state in which the question had been left by the speeches on the other side of the House, and by the speech of his hon. and learned friend, that he had determined not to take any part in this debate, and was only induced to abandon that determination by the speech of the hon. baronet; which had given an entirely different character to the discussion. The worthy alderman proposed that a committee should be appointed to inquire into the conduct of an individual, with a view of bringing that individual to justice, and was so far from accusing the government, that he called upon ministers to give him their assistance, hut they now found that it was considered by the hon. baronet that the motion Was a motion against ministers, and that the result of the inquiry proposed would probably prove, not only that Edwards was criminal, but establish guilt against the government itself. Under this imputation, he thought it would be as inexcusable in him to be silent as it would have been in-excusable under different circumstances
 279 prima facie prima facie 280 pro tanto 281 282 283 284 argumenti grati.â 285
 Mr. Canning  said, he had not taken any thing amiss which had fallen from the hon. baronet. He had only replied to him as the advocate of the hon. alderman's motion. There certainly were no two persons at greater variance on the subject of politics than the hon. baronet and himself; but there was no member he more
 293
 Mr. Canning  said, he understood the worthy alderman wished to withdraw the motion; he therefore took the opportunity of stating, that he, for one, would not suffer the motion to be withdrawn.
 Mr. Brougham  observed, that the right
 289 noli prosequi
 Mr. Brougham  assured the House that he should occupy their attention but for a few moments, as he had nothing very material to the question to offer, although he differed from the views of his friends near him, by whom the motion was supported as well as from the opinions of the gentlemen opposite, by whom that motion was opposed. He stood in such a situation, that he had to vindicate himself against the observations of both, which he hoped he should be found to do upon some interchange of explanation. As to the remark which the attorney-general was understood to have made, namely, that money was furnished to the late conspirators by some persons of consequence, upon that remark, as it was explained by the right hon. member for Liverpool, he was not disposed to dwell. But there was a remark from the right hon. gentleman himself, with regard to which he felt it necessary to call for some explanation, in: order to prevent any erroneous impression from going forth to the country. Observing that the right hon. gentleman had left the House, he should wait for the explanation he required until his return, being persuaded that he should obtain a satisfactory explanation from the candour of the right bon. gentleman; he meant as to that passage in the right hon. gentleman's speech, in which he was understood to say
 287 288
 Mr. Butterworth  stated to the House, that one individual who had been seduced into the late plot, not by Edwards, but by one of his own neighbours (in consequence of reading seditious publications), and who bore a good character theretofore, had repented of his conduct; and having communicated his situation to a friend of his, his friend advised him to go before a magistrate and disclose all he knew of the transactions. Having been introduced to him (Mr. B.),and frankly disclosed the whole of what he knew; he (Mr. B.) brought him before a magistrate; but so terrified was he, that he would not on any account, allow his name to be disclosed—it was notdisclosed. Having been apprised of the present motion he (Mr.B.) sent for him, that day and asked him whether he knew Edwards? He replied, that he knew nothing of Edwards since the execution of Thistlewood and his companions. One of the persons implicated in that transaction had reminded him that Edwards attended some of the early meetings, but he did not see him attend any of the late meetings of the conspirators. He (Mr. B.) asked the man whether it was necessary that such a person as Edwards should persuade to acts of violence? He replied by saying "do you suppose we were children?"—The men engaged were men of firmness and understanding, and they were most desperate in the business; at one of their meetings it was observed, that the servants of the ministers were not involved in their masters' guilt, and therefore ought not to be murdered; but the proposal to spare the servants was opposed, as it was said to be sometimes necessary
 261
 Mr. Hume  expressed himself surprised that the hon. member who had last spoken could impute such improper motives to the hon. alderman who had introduced this question. The conduct of that worthy alderman was as upright and proper as that of the hon. member himself, or any other member in that House. The hon. alderman had acted in situations where that conduct was tried—in.a situation which he (Mr. Butterworth) had not been in, and he was always found humanely attentive to all its duties. Was it to be called a crime in him to endeavour to come at truth? He conceived it was not, and that the objection of the honourable member amounted to nothing at all.—It was too much to attribute improper motives to an hon member for an attempt to come at the truth. [Hear, hear! and laughter from the ministerial benches.] Gentlemen might laugh if they pleased. He was, however, sorry to find such a disposition on the present occasion.—It was different when any matter was brought forward in which ministers were interested; then they were all ear, and gave every, attention. He could not conceive why the; House should refuse inquiry on this important question. In an official despatch from the government of Bengal it was stated, in strong terms that there was the amplest evidence to prove that a person, employed as a spy had devised the robbery and murder of which he afterwards convicted the unhappy person who was seduced by his instigations. The hon. alderman had shown that Edwards, accompanied by his brother, had brought

 Mr. Denman  said, it was impossible not to observe, that the opinion which he and some of his friends near him had formed on the subject before them was disagree-

 Mr. Speaker ; I feel it incumbent upon me to state shortly my reasons for voting for a motion which, as it has been characterized as senseless, stupid, and absurd, cannot, it appears, be supported without some excuse; and in so doing, I am aware that it is necessary to intreat the House to grant to me the indulgence usually bestowed upon a young member. Indeed I cannot conceal from myself—I cannot conceal from others—that these are peculiar circumstances attending my position here, which make it more than commonly requisite to lay claim to the patience, the attention, and even the candour of the House, whilst I endeavour to explain my sentiments upon a question on which such division of opinion seems likely to prevail [Hear, hear!]. My embarrassment is increased also, since I venture to oppose a gentleman of experience so tried, and of character so high, both in this House and in the country, as the hon. member who has just sat down, and has given opinions so diametrically opposite to those which I venture to entertain. But, unless I am mistaken in every point of view in which I have been able to consider tin's subject—unless I am totally unable to distinguish between right and wrong—unless I have mis-read all the records of this House and of the country, this question is such as an English House of Commons not only should not reject without examination, but is bound seriously to entertain. The hon. member has told us, that this House should not meddle with the criminal jurisdiction of the courts of law. The position, generally speaking, may be admitted—for who does not see that much mischief must ensue from the interference of the makers with the administrators of the laws? And yet it is undeniable that there are many precedents for this interference—it is undeniable that the House of Commons has, in various
 256 257 258 259 "inter adversa temporum" "Princcps qui delatores non castigat, irritat." 260
 The Speaker  observed, that he was happy to find there was no ground for the supposed irritation of the feelings of the hon. members.
 The Speaker  rose amidst loud cries of Hear, hear! He was satisfied, he said, that there could be but one feeling of thankfulness in that House towards the hon. and gallant member for the observations that had just proceeded from him; and he was equally sure, that if any expressions, conjured up by the warmth of debate, had fallen from any honourable members, they would be very ready to give the House that satisfaction, which the hon. and gallant member had so handsomely and so properly solicited [Here a pause of several seconds ensued]. The Speaker at length again rose. The hon. and gallant member, he observed, in addressing the House at first, had not pointed so distinctly to the objects of his speech as to name the members to whom he alluded. He, therefore, now felt it to be his duty to say, that he understood the allusion to apply to sir Francis Burdett and Mr. Canning.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  would merely address a few words to that part of his hon. friend's speech which was directed towards himself personally. When his lamented friend sir S. Romilly brought in his bill for the abolition of the horrible
 237
 Sir James Mackintosh  rose, pursuant to notice, to submit certain propositions to the House touching the present state of the criminal law, founded on the report of the committee which had been appointed last session, to take into consideration so much of the criminal code as related to the infliction of capital punishment. The propositions which he should have the honor to propose, embraced two objects; the first was the appointment of a committee for a similar purpose as that which sat during the last session; and, in the second place, he should move for leave to bring in six bring in for the amendment of the criminal law, agreeably to the recommendation contained in the report of the late committee. As he understood there existed no intention in that quarter where he should much regret hostility, to oppose the propositions which he should have the honor to submit, he certainly should not trespass long on the attention of the House, did he not think it respectful towards those new members, who had not heard the former arguments, very shortly to review the nature of the grounds on which this subject was introduced. The object for which the committee was appointed by the last House of Commons, was, to ascertain, by the fullest inquiry and by the best experience, whether the severity of capital punishments did not

 Sir R. Wilson,  in seconding the motion, could not withhold his tribute of praise to the worthy alderman, to whose vigilance and attention to the public interests the country was so much indebted. He hoped that his majesty's ministers would not, on consideration, object to the motion. The more particularly as it would afford them an opportunity of vindicating themselves from the reproach of being connected with this Edwards, as well as from the mysterious circumstance of his not having been put either to the bar or in the jury box. He was not in England when the trial took place, but he had not since his return, conversed with any man who did not deplore the, circumstance of that person not having been brought forward, either as a culprit or a witness. It appeared that one of the sheriffs, accompanied by another gentleman, waited on lord Sidmouth, requesting that he might be called as a witness. He was not prepared to say that spies were not necessary under certain circumstances, but he must say, that an organised spy system was most abominable. If ministers were prepared to say, that the state of this, country was such as to require an organized
 250 251
 Sir Robert Wilson  said, that it could not fail to have been observed by the House that some warm words had passed between certain honourable members in the course of that debate. It would be much to be regretted if the House should break up without the satisfaction of knowing that those words, so uttered in the heat of the moment, had, in fact, made no unpleasant impresssion on the minds of the parties, who, he hoped, would therefore gratify the House, by manifesting the absence of any feeling contrary to that amicable understanding with which it was customary to conduct the discussions in that House [Hear, hear!].
 Lord Milton  observed, that it would be extremely inconvenient, supposing a number of boroughs to be disfranchised, to give the right of voting to those who, as freeholders, had now a right of voting for county members. Supposing, for instance, five Cornish boroughs to fall under the lash of the House—a circumstance by no means impossible—those to whom the franchise was transferred would then have to vote for twelve members—two for the county, and ten for other places.
 Sir. W. Curtis  presented the report of the committee to whom had been referred for consideration the petition from the lord mayor, aldermen, and corporation of London, praying to be allowed to raise a further sum for the completion of the improvements at the west end of the city. The hon. baronet moved, That the report be referred to a committee of the whole House."
 Sir W. Curtis  had no sort of objection to send the accounts to a select committee, but it appeared to him that such a proceeding, on the report of another com-
 294
 Mr. Alderman Wood  had no objection to the motion for sending the accounts to a select committee for examination. The hon. member for Surrey had frequently touched on the subject of the duty on coals, but had never been able to make a successful impression on the House. What would be the effect of the present proposition on the hon. gentleman's constituents? That some thirty years hence they would pay a shilling a chaldron more for their coals than at present! That for which they would so pay, would be also as great an advantage to them as to other people. Instead of the narrow confined streets in which coaches and carts were now sometimes detained for two or three hours, fine wide streets would be opened, a circumstance which had no connexion with the new post-office. This street would show St. Paul's in a nobler point of view than it had been yet seen from the north road.
 Mr. Baring  was as anxious as any other honourable member could be to see a definite and permanent policy adopted; to see, indeed, the country in an independent situation, which it never could be in its present financial circumstances. We were, however, so peculiarly placed, that it was very difficult to estimate correctly, our own resources. He made this remark in candour and fairness to the right hon. gentleman. Though sorry to learn it, as a matter of information, he could easily conceive why a deficiency should have taken place upon the last quarter. What he dreaded was, lest the same uncertainty should attach to every future estimate of our revenue. Nothing, however, could be calculated on, without a greater degree of quiet and subordination than at present existed. In the present unfortunate state of the country, he was averse to any decisive measure, till he could see the strength of our means. Labouring, as we did, under a want of credit and of confidence, from the state of the country, he did not think that any decisive measure could at present be proposed. There was, indeed, plenty of money in the country; but would there be such a depression of stock, if there was not a want of confidence? If there were a sinking fund of 5,000,000 l. 304
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that Mr. Pitt's draughts in Hamburgh were of quite a different description. The draughts at present circulated abroad were made applicable to funds abroad. In a few months he would wind up the whole account, and then present to the House regular accounts of all.
 Mr. Grenfell  said a few words respecting large quantities of silver imported into this country, and large draughts on the treasury of this country, arising from such imports.
 Mr. Baring  said, that it was quite sufficient for him to hear the intention of the right hon. gentleman to present the accounts. If the right hon. gentleman had general bonds for money outstanding on the continent, he would say, as far as he knew the subject, that it was a measure extremely objectionable; and he had heard that there were draughts at three months circulated all over the continent.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that those draughts were for silver imported into this country.
 Mr. Maberly  rose for the purpose of making the mo-
 298 l. l. 299 l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l, l. l. 300 l. l. l. l. l. l. s. 301 l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he should not discharge his duty to the country by prematurely entering into an explanation of his financial arrangements. he was aware that much anxiety existed
 302 l. l. l. l.
 Mr. Maberly,  in reply, assured the House that his observations were not made with a view to profit the fundholder, but to benefit the country at large. He was anxious to see a permanent sinking fund established, and our financial system placed on a sound and permanent footing. He begged to assure the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that he had no wish to pry into his financial arrangements; on the contrary, he was aware that any premature disclosure of them would be injurious,
 305
 Mr. H. Sumner  objected to this proposition. The sum of 240,000 l. l. l. s. d,
 Mr. Stuart-Wortley  presented a petition from the manufacturers and other inhabitants, residing in one of the most populous places in the manufacturing district of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the parish of Kirkheaton, complaining of distress, and attributing that distress principally to the duties on wool. He would read to the House a paragraph from the petition, to show the severe nature of the distress experienced, premising that the petition came from persons as well-disposed to the support of government as the inhabitants of any part of the island. The hon. gentleman read the passage in question, which declared that the distress of the petitioners was great beyond example, and that they could not better illustrate its severity than by a reference to the state of the poorer manufacturers in the parish of seven or eight thousand, of whom 1700 had on an average earned, during the present year, only 11½ a week each. The petitioners prayed that the House would take the state
 295
 Mr. J. Smith  expressed his disapprobation of the system of finance lately adopted by the right hon. gentleman. It had fallen within his knowledge, that considerable sums had been vested in foreign countries, in consequence of the alarm felt from the insecurity of our present system. There was nothing more necessary than the establishment of a permanent system of finance; as long as our present system was persevered in, so long would surmises, doubts, and alarms exist in the public mind. If it should be found necessary to impose any new tax, he hoped it would be levied on those who were best able to pay it. He could not help saying,
 303
 Mr. Butterworth  presented a Petition from William Cobbett, lately a Candidate for the city of Coventry, setting forth. 296 297
 Sir John Newport  said, that he could never consent to the strengthening of the funds at the expence of the community. If the funds were improved by fresh burdens on the country, that would be improving them at the expense of the other interests of the community. The stockholder already received increased value, for be had become a stockholder during a depreciated currency, and now he received increased value by means of the meliorated currency. No sacrifice ought to be made of the great interests of the country for the benefit of the stock-holder. The commercial and agricultural interests were already in great difficulty, and their difficulties seemed not to be diminishing. He therefore must protest against any improvement of the funds, at the expense of the landholder.
 Mr. Curwen  observed, that the hon. member was quite mistaken in his representation of the objects of the petitioners. Had lie given himself the trouble to attend to the allegations of the many that had been already presented, he would have found that they abstained from stating any specific measure of relief, but prayed generally for an inquiry. Was that inquiry to be refused by the House? He trusted not; and when it took place, he was convinced it would appear that the object was not to put money into the pockets of the landlord or the farmer, but to enable them to give employment to labour. In the present distressed state of the agricultural interest, he knew, and he said it with pain, that it was made the object of both the landlord and the farmer, to abstract rather than to employ labour. He should be very sorry that any premature discussion on the subject should take place, and therefore he regretted that a gallant and honourable member had on a former night sounded an alarum on the question. There could be no separate
 330
 Mr. Calcraft  hoped that as long as petitioners approached that House in moderate and respectful language, their application for inquiry would be attended to. When the measure for increasing the importation price of corn was under the consideration of parliament, he had voted against it, but though he did not feel himself bound by that conduct to oppose inquiry, he never had conceived that this question could not be viewed as one in which the interests were divided. Agriculture and commerce had an equal and a common interest in their respective prosperity. It was also to be recollected, that the whole burthen of the poor was thrown upon the agricultural interest. That his hon. friend who spoke last, had, on a former evening, admitted to be a question worthy of investigation. Was it not right then to ascertain whether any relief could be afforded, even on that point?
 Lord Sefton  presented a petition from the merchants, housekeepers, and other inhabitants of Liverpool. It was signed by nearly 400 individuals of the highest respectability. The petitioners stated, that they observed that a bill had been brought into the House for the regulation of the civil list, and the}' hoped, that in proceeding to the consideration of that object, the House would bear in mind the existing national distress. The petitioners particularly adverted to the subject of pensions, and described the bad effect on the public mind arising from the lavish and indiscriminate manner in which they were bestowed. They hoped that the amount and disposition of these pensions would be clearly defined by parliament; and they also hoped it might be made the law of the land, that no part of the pension fund should ever be granted
 334
 Mr. Bennet  took that opportunity of giving notice, that whenever the civil list bill should come into the committee, he would propose the introduction of a clause, providing, that members of the House of Commons who should receive from the Crown any such grants as those alluded to in the petition, should vacate their seats.
 Mr. Hobhouse  rose to present a petition from certain inhabitants of Oldham, the contents of which they prayed the House to take into their serious consideration. It appeared from the petition, that a series of military outrages, as the petitioners denominated them, had I recently been committed in the neighbourhood of Oldham. In the first place, he wished to state, that whether these were, or were not, exaggerated accounts of transactions which did not deserve the designation given to them, it was not possible for him to say; but, as far as he could collect information on the subject, he believed that every thing stated I in the petition was perfectly correct; and he would farther add, that there was nothing in the petition that was at all disrespectful to the House. It appeared, according to the petition, that the inhabitants of Oldham had, on two or three occasions, been subjected to the excesses of the military, who, immediately subsequent; to those excesses, had been removed, and replaced by others; in consequence of which, the inhabitants did not know who the soldiers were by whom they had been molested; and therefore they had not the means of procuring justice by a legal process. He understood that, most unfortunately, such a suspicion was entertained of the possibility of receiving justice at the hands of the magistrates, that the inhabitants would much rather go before the commanding officer than apply
 335
 Mr. B. Wilbraham  said, that having expressed his anxiety that the subject should be thoroughly investigated, in consequence of the various matters that had come to his knowledge with respect to it, he wished, in order to guard himself from the charge of inconsistency, to state, that now, having heard the petition read, he was of opinion that the allegations which it contained were not a fit subject for parliamentary inquiry.
 Sir F. Burdett  said, that all that had been observed by the hon. gentleman was so very little to the purpose, in the present stage of the proceeding, that he certainly would not have risen, if it were not for the disposition which the hon. gentleman evinced to reject the petition. It appeared to him to be of very little importance who might or might not be the drawer up of that petition. And it would be most extraordinary, if, on a mere statement of the kind which the hon. gentleman had made to the House—a statement which he doubtless had received from some persons connected with the transaction—it should be decided, as a matter of course, that there was no ground for this complaint, which described an outrage affecting all the inhabitants of the town, and testified by 3,000 of them. It was of a more serious and important nature than the hon. gentleman seemed to suppose. It was indeed so important, that he hoped the House would not only receive the petition now, but would not let it remain long on their table, without instituting some inquiry into the facts. It appeared to him to be a subject of such magnitude, that he thought he should be hardly doing his duty to the country, if he did not call for an inquiry into the matters which that petition disclosed. He thought it was impossible for them to reject this petition, without any reason of any kind being given for such a proceeding—without even knowing the matter which it contained—merely from the statement of an hon. gentleman. When they were informed that the most weak and defenceless part of the community had attacked men who always had the power to overbear those whom they disliked, and who always, more particularly under the existing circumstances of the country, felt a strong inclination to use that power, they should listen to the assertion cautiously, and abstain from rejecting the petition on such a statement.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  had
 337
 Sir R. Heron  said, he could not help expressing his gratitude to ministers for the forbearance they had manifested on tin's occasion. His majesty had in his speech from the throne, been graciously pleased to recommend economy. The distresses of the country loudly called for its adoption. The country was in such a situation, that it could with difficulty pay the interest of the national debt. And, under all these circumstances, what was the forbearance of ministers? Why, they simply contented themselves with fixing the civil list at the highest rate at which it had ever been—at a rate at which it stood when money was three times more plentiful than it was at this moment. They would have better consulted both the dignity of the Crown and the situation of the country, had they commenced a system of economy in that quarter where it could be enforced with so little comparative inconvenience. He feared that the ominous mention of the word "economy," in the royal speech, was only for the purpose of dispensing with it in practice. If this was so, ministers were responsible, and deserved the just indignation of the country [Hear!].
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the surplus of the third class had regularly been carried to the consolidated fund, and the accounts of the consolidated fund uniformly accounted for every such surplus. To that fund he referred the hon. gentleman for an account of this part of the civil list. A few days ago an order had been made for an account of all pensions, including the pensions to which the hon. gentleman had alluded. This account, would soon be laid before the House. Plate was usually given where official situations required greater display and splendor than the salary could afford. In general, presents of this kind were very moderate, and below the amount which the station of those to whom they were made might seem to require. Since the year 1816 services of plate had been given to all ambassadors to foreign courts, in order to enable them to support the dignity and splendor of representatives of the sovereign.
 Mr. Ricardo  was not disposed to refuse inquiry to the petitioners, though he thought,
 331
 Mr. Dugdale  rose to present a petition from the manufacturers and traders of Birmingham, stating the distress which prevailed in that town in consequence of the stagnation of trade. The petitioners observed, that the distress and inconvenience under which they laboured had existed for a considerable time, and would, they were afraid, go on increasing, unless some effectual remedy were found. They did not pretend to point out any remedy, but they seriously hoped that this House would institute a solemn inquiry into the causes of the prevailing distress. After what had occurred on a former evening he would not trouble the House with the details connected with this subject; but he believed that the account of the distress contained in the petition was not at all exaggerated. He had received statements from various* sources, all concurring in the magnitude of the distress which at present existed—a fact that was farther proved by the increase of the poor-rates in that quarter. There never was, he thought, a case that required more decidedly the interference Of parliament; and he trusted that, if any means could be devised for alleviating the sufferings of the people, that relief and that assistance would be rendered them as speedily as possible.
 Mr. Bootle Wilbraham  hoped that the motion of the hon. presenter would be agreed to; but in so desiring his object was different from that of the hon. baronet. He viewed the subject in a light very different from that in which the hon. baronet saw it. He wished the allegations of the petition should be known and canvassed, because he believed that the more they were known and canvassed, the less ground would there appear for the complaint. He believed the hon. gentleman (Mr. Clive) had stated the facts as they really were, and he trusted that the whole matter would go fairly before the public. They would be enabled to judge, from the reading of the petition, whether there was any good cause of complaint on the part of those individuals; and therefore he hoped the petition would be received.
 Lord Nugent  stated, that he could vouch for the unequivocal respectability of the petitioners. In their allegations as to the poor laws, he agreed with them; in many other respects he differed with them, most particularly as to the extension of the principle by which the price of corn was raised. Such an unnatural increase directly went to raise the price of labour, and add to the pressure of the poor-rates. It was, however, not to be denied, that the distress amongst the occupiers of land was excessive. Many farmers, who were in possession of property, were actually living on their capital, and those who had saved nothing, or but a little, were totally ruined. The country in fact, at the present hour, laboured under a stagnation of all its leading interests. The causes were, to him, plain and obvi-
 332
 Mr. Brougham  said, that the petition was very numerously signed, and he believed a more respectable body of men did not exist than those whose complaints were now before the House. They were not persons connected with any particular political party; amongst them were to be found some who took one side in politics—some who took another. They were indeed the most respectable, and the most worthy of the attention of that House, of any of the members of the community to which they belonged. He was exceedingly anxious to support the motion, that they should have a hearing. But he could not help stating his own feeling, as he had done before the last recess, that a compliance with the prayer of their petition was not likely to be attended with any beneficial result. Not that he had the smallest kind of doubt of the facts stated in the petition; not that he did not believe that the distress of which they complained was deeply and widely spread over that district (he wished he was not justified in adding, that it extended also over all the rest of the country; but because, from marking the course of such a proceeding, he had come to an opinion which was firmly rooted in his mind—that a parliamentary inquiry instituted in that House, with a view to revising, altering, and amending commercial or agricultural concerns, was by no means the best mode that could be adopted for attaining the desired object. He conceived that ministers themselves, by their means of information, by the remedies which they might recommend to parliament, and which, above all, they could support by their influence, were the persons who should devise measures of this description. They presented the only rational means of affording substantial relief; and he was sorry to be obliged to add, that the present administration, from the view which they appeared to have taken with respect to the agricultural and commercial interest, and, indeed, with reference to every thing they had done on those great questions of political economy, were not very likely to go into an inquiry of this kind in such a spirit as the exigency of the times demanded. He must also add, if they did proceed to this inquiry, that the country must feel, looking to all their acts, and to the degree of confidence which they enjoyed, that they were not precisely that sort of government, who could, with a reasonable prospect of suc-
 340
 Mr. Brougham,  in explanation, said, he had a right to complain of two misrepresentations which the hon. gentleman had made of his speech. He had in two instances wholly mistaken him. The hon. gentleman had talked as if he had said, that no party in that House could form a ministry. He had not stated any such thing. What he had said was, that the exigencies of the state at this moment called for most important measures; and that no ordinary ministry could meet that task satisfactorily, which could alone be effected by a ministry so constituted as to conciliate the whole country. In the second place, he never had called on the House to turn a deaf ear to the petitioners; He had said the very reverse. He had called on the House to turn their ear to them, with the assistance of those Who possessed great influence, and who could carry such measures as they thought fit—he meant his majesty's government. Let the petition be brought up; let it be laid oh the table; and he hoped it would lead his majesty's ministers to institute an inquiry on the subject.
 Mr. H. Clive  said, he did not think there was any good ground for the complaint, and he had, under that impression, opposed the petition in the first instance.
 Mr. H. Clive  wished to offer a few words on the subject of the petition, which, he believed, was drawn up by a person of some notoriety, who came from London, and was now connected with the Manchester Observer. That individual had, he understood, felt a strong inclination to charge the military with riotous behaviour. On the 25th of April, a sort of rejoicing took place at Oldham, and at one of the public-houses, where a number of the town people were assembled, there happened also to be a few of the military. A most improper toast was given by one of the former, on which the soldiers wished to withdraw, and they were grossly insulted. On the following day, the same toast was repeated at another alehouse. The obnoxious toast was, "May the skin of every loyal man be torn from his back, in order to make a drum for the reformers to beat to arms!" Was it possible, he would ask, for any person serving the king to hear such a toast without resenting it? There were only five or six soldiers in the room, and there were twenty of the inhabitants present, who attacked the military when they remonstrated on the impropriety of their conduct. One of the soldiers went out, in consequence, and called on his comrades to come and protect their companions from being murdered. In the mean time, the House was filled with townspeople, and about ten or fifteen soldiers procured admission, by breaking the pannels of the door, for they had been barricadoed out. They met with resistance, and they gave and received blows. There the business ended; but individuals in the town made the matter of more importance than it really was, and

 General Gascoyne  contended that the hon. member, who wished too often to discuss a public question in detail, had either not heard him, or had misunderstood him. In place of sounding any alarum, he had implored the House to pause before, in the present state of the public mind, when too many were irritated without cause, it afforded any ground for increasing that agitation. What other object could these petitions all drawn up in a similar manner, and all complaining of the importation of corn have, but to raise the price of that necessary article? He had that day received a letter from a most respectable manufacturer in the neighbourhood of Manchester, requesting his opinion of the propriety of calling meetings and of petitioning, for the purpose of meeting these agricultural petitions. His answer was, that it would be better to wait until the objects of the petitioners were a little better defined.
 Mr. Lambton  concurred with the hon. baronet in stating, that the petitioners mere most respectable individuals. They principally belonged to that class of society which had not hitherto taken so great a share in the consideration of public affairs, as he was persuaded it would be highly advantageous to the country they should do—he meant the middle class.
 333
 Mr. Hume  rose to enter his protest against the proceedings of ministers. He did not do so on the grounds which the hon. baronet had stated, because he was not prepared to say, that, if the expenditure of the household for the last five years were laid before parliament, the amount would appear to have been extravagant. If any thing could induce ministers to lay full information on the table of the House, before any money was voted, the statements made by an hon. gentleman on this side of the House, and by another hon. member on that side of the House, representing the difficulties and distress of the country, ought to have that effect. Yet ministers came forward and called upon the House to vote 850,000 l. 344 l., l., 345 l.
 Mr. Hume  stated, that observing the daily increase of these petitions, he could not avoid saying, that they appeared to him calculated to aggravate the general distress, by calling at such a time for the imposition of additional restrictions on the importation of grain. Could any man acquainted with the country, propose any measure more likely to increase the notorious sufferings of the commercial and manufacturing classes? The extent of those sufferings required of that House to give the fill up to industry, by the removal of all commercial restrictions; and he was the more surprised at the course to which these petitioners manifestly inclined, when it was recollected that the late corn law had altogether failed, as a measure of relief to the body for which it was intended.
 Mr. Spooner,  in explanation, said, that he had merely alluded to the observations of the learned gentleman, with respect to the formation of an efficient administration, as a matter that had not at all entered the contemplation of the petitioners when they addressed the House.
 Mr. Spooner,  knowing the distress which the industrious manufacturers of Birmingham laboured under claimed the attention of the House while be offered a few observations. He meant when he came into the House to enter into a detailed statement of the distresses which prevailed in the country; but having heard what was said by the hon. member for Chichester, and the House appearing to feel with him the inconvenience of partial debates on such important subjects, he had come to a determination not to pursue the course he originally intended, and to that determination he would have adhered if it had not been for the most extraordinary reason which the learned member had just given to induce the House not to proceed with an inquiry. The learned gentleman had stated, that there, was not any party in that House fit to form an administration. This point, lie begged to observe, never entered the minds of the petitioners when they represented their grievances to parliament, in the only constitutional way which was open to, them. He hoped, therefore, the House would agree with him, that the reason given by the learned member was not sufficient to, induce them to refuse the prayer, of the petition—namely, to enter into full, deliberate, and solemn inquiry, as to the distressed state of the town and neighbourhood of Birmingham. He was sorry to hear the learned member say, that an inquiry so instituted would be of no use. He should feel deeply grieved if the opinion of the country agreed with that of the learned gentleman. For his own part, he relied with confidence on the wisdom of that House, and so likewise did the petitioners. They looked to parliament for assistance in this emergency, and-he trusted they

 Mr. Huskisson  deprecated the continuance of any premature discussion on a question which every member must feel to be one of peculiar delicacy. He: therefore suggested that the similar petitions which were to be presented should be allowed to be placed on the table with out discussion, particularly as an hon.; member had already given notice of a motion on these petitions for a future day.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  said, he held in his hand a petition from the merchants, bankers, and tradesmen, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in favour of parliamentary reform. The petition was signed by 3016 persons, and for the respectability of their characters he could vouch his own personal knowledge. The meeting at which the petition was agreed to was conducted with the greatest quietness and unanimity. It was the first meeting held under the restrictive laws passed by the last parliament. It sprung from that middle class of life, the respectability of whose characters and station placed their motives beyond suspicion. These petitioners looked for the correction of the evils under which the country now suffered, to a shortening of the duration Of parliaments, to the extension of the suffrage from decayed and notoriously dependent and corrupt boroughs to populous towns. The latter principle had been already acted upon, and he hailed it as a preliminary step in the successful progress of a constitutional reform in the representation. The petitioners begged not to be considered as the advocates of any mischievous doctrines—such as universal suffrage and annual parliaments.
 Sir J. Newport  considered that the gallant general had not a little contributed to that agitation which he deplored, having taken, in the earliest stage, the opportunity of giving a very decisive opinion on the object of the petitioners. He trusted the doors of that House would never be closed against any class of the people who conceived themselves aggrieved, whenever they approached it with temperate and respectful language. He deprecated the doctrine, that the agricultural body had a separate interest from the rest of the community. Believing the home market to be the most beneficial, the manufacturers had an equal interest in the prosperity of agriculture.
 Lord Milton  said, that the statement of the hon. gentleman opposite, and the sort of opposition the petition had met with, were, he conceived, most unfortunate. He could not help thinking, that those who made such statements, and offered such opposition, were consulting their feelings and passions, rather than their justice and discretion. Whether the statement of the hon. gentleman behind him, or that of the hon. secretary opposite, were the true one, mattered nothing. The complaint was of too grave and serious a nature not to call for the consideration of the House. He was surprised to hear the hon. member declare that he wished the petition to be received, with a view different from that of the hon. baronet, because it was a complaint which, when it had undergone investigation, would appear to be groundless. Investigation was all that was demanded; and he trusted it would be pursued further than a mere debate in that House. It was not the statement of one gentleman or of another—it was not what much oc-
 338
 Lord Milton  was unequivocally of opinion, that if a portion of the people had suffered any grievance for which the House could afford a remedy, it was then-duty to investigate its nature.
 Earl Temple  said, that the petitioners asked only for inquiry; they did not presume to point out the means.
 Mr. Smith  moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  remarked that the sheriffs of London were in waiting with a petition against it, and professed his own opinion that the undertaking could lead to no other end than a sacrifice of capital on the part of those who embarked in it.
 Mr. Lyttleton  condemned the proposed measure, as a gross violation of private property.
 Mr. Baring  thought generally, that such undertakings were productive of benefit to the country, and that they ought to be patronised. He could see no reason to prevent the House from considering the present measure.
 Lord F. Osborn  was of opinion that the good expected from the projected undertaking was not sufficiently extensive to induce the House to interfere with private property.
 Mr Alderman Heygate  said, that the public advantage, and not private interest
 347
 Mr. Cripps  said, it had been stated that the city of London laid out large sums of money in improving the navigation of the Thames. If so, they had ex pended it to very little purpose; for goods were now six weeks, and even two months going down to that part of the; country where he resided. He would oppose a canal projected for mere speculative purposes, but he would support a measure which was likely to be so beneficial as the present.
 Mr. Bennet  said, the city of London had not improvidently lavished their money in improving the navigation of the Thames. That part which was under their jurisdiction was very much improved.
 Mr. Hart Davies  said, the projected canal would be a work of great public benefit. If they went into the committee, it would be found that the landholders were favourable to it.
 Mr. Ascot  observed, that every person who traded between London and Bristol would be benefitted by the formation of the canal.
 Sir F. Burdett  gave notice that he should bring forward a motion for inquiry into the late transactions at Oldham.
 Mr. Philips  was of opinion, that the arguments in favour of going into the committee greatly outweighed those that were adduced against that proceeding.
 The Lord Advocate  expressed a hope, that whatever might be thought of the merit of the opinion, which appeared from him, in the paper on the table, the House would do him the justice to believe that that opinion was his genuine and conscientious impression; and he trusted that the same credit would be given to those great authorities with whom he had the honour to concur, and who were best qualified to judge upon the subject. Whether the report on the table was true or not, he was certainly responsible for it. If he erred, he erred with those who were best qualified to give a judicial opinion in that country. The opinion in that report was founded on a due consideration of the national contract at the union of the two countries—an union which had proved satisfactory to the people, and promoted the interests of that part of the country, for more than a century. That contract was not to be wantonly broken in upon. This was the substance of the report. If any change should be made, it ought to be the result of deep deliberation, and till that deliberation could be bestowed on the subject, the numbers of the judges ought not to be reduced. The appointment now in question was known to have arisen from the circumstance that one of the barons had found his duties in the court of Exchequer incompatible with his duties as chief commissioner of the jury court. The jury court had been lately introduced into Scotland. No new judges had been appointed for this court, in order that, if the experiment should be found unsatis-
 361 362 363 364 365
 The Lord Advocate  apologized for the expression, and assured the House, he had no intention of giving offence to any honourable member; he was only desirous, when he heard the name of an individual whom he so much respected called into question, that the evening of his life should close with the same consideration which his former conduct had always commanded. But he returned to the consideration of that commission to which he had principally called the attention of the House; and as to the commissioners, with all the respect and esteem which he entertained for them personally, he must say that with the exception of' the chief commissioner, he did consider them to be unqualified. One of them, after practising at the bar, went into the country and lived upon his estate, without returning to his practice; another went to India, and, after staying there for some time, returned, and lived almost entirely in the country; and a third, having also practised some time at the bar, retired to his estate, improved the country round it, but never returned to the profession. Such persons might be well qualified to report upon the fees and emoluments of the officers, but not upon the constitution of the court. But he did not rely only on the objection to the competency of these commissioners; he would appeal to the unanimous opinion of those who were most competent to decide; of the lord president, of the lord justice clerk, the lord commissioner of the jury court, above all, he relied on the authority of the lord chief baron, an individual who had gone so lately from this country, after acquiring a thorough and extensive knowledge of the whole body of the laws of these kingdoms, and whose special duty it was, if it were any one's, to say whether an appointment of this nature was or was not necessary. He did not know what authority the chief-baron's name might have there; but certain he was, that in his (the lord advocate's) part of the country, they felt grateful to his majesty's ministers for having sent among them a man whose talents as a judge were not more respected than his virtues as an individual were admired. After attaining to very high honours in his profession, he declined those highest ones to which he might reasonably and certainly have aspired, and, in the discharge of his duty, was willing, at his time of life, to undertake that duty, accompanied as it was
 367 368 369
 The Lord Advocate  remarked, that individuals were always liable to indisposition. He had felt it necessary to make the observations which he had made in justice to the character of a distinguished individual now no more.
 Lord Castlereagh  wished shortly to state the reasons which induced him to vote against the noble lord's motion. A report having been made by the commissioners appointed by parliament, that report was referred to the consideration of the chief judges of Scotland, who gave it as their decided opinion, for which opinion the grounds were distinctly stated, that the establishment of the court of exchequer ought to be kept in its full state; and now the noble lord called upon the House without previous inquiry, without any evidence, and without suggesting any facts on his own authority, to come to the conclusion that the constitution of the court of exchequer in Scotland ought to be changed—that that constitution for ages had been faulty—and that the decision of certain commissioners ought to be preferred to the deliberate judgment of the learned heads of all the different courts. Before he stated the reasons why he could not join in opinion with the noble lord, he must be allowed to say a few words (and few they should be, as he was not desirous of diverting the attention of members to any by-battle) on the conduct and motives of government. He did not complain of the hon. baronet for watching over the report, and protecting it with a sort of paternal solicitude; nor should he object to the introduction by him of any direct motion of censure upon ministers if he thought they had deserved it; but he begged the hon. baronet to observe, that if he supposed that, in times like the present, ministers had any other object in view than to redress and reform actual abuses,

 Mr. Tierney  said, that he never had entertained a doubt that this was one of the motions which ministers would meet by the previous question. What course had the noble lord pursued? He had endeavoured to make people believe that ministers were a set of very ill-used gentlemen, and giving the real point in dispute the go-by, he had maintained, that his noble friend had introduced a new fangled, or to use his lordship's own most happily applied epithet, a fantastical proposition. His lordship had warned the new members to be on their guard, for if they voted with opposition they might get into great difficulties. If they supported the noble lord, they had

 Lord A. Hamilton  observed, in reference to what a noble lord had said, that he did not intend to confine his motion to the one at present before the House. 386
 Lord A. Hamilton,  in explanation, said, that the learned lord seemed to have understood him as using the fact of the absence of the baron of the exchequer, as an "argumentum ad hominem:" but it was with quite a contrary intention. All that he meant to say was, that, judging from the absence of this gentleman for two or three years (a term which the learned lord had corrected, by substituting one year in its place), it appeared that four barons were sufficient for the business of the court.
 Lord Archibald Hamilton  rose, in pursuance of notice, to move for a. copy of the late appointment of a fourth Baron of the Exchequer in Scotland, in opposition to the recommendation of the commissioners, who recommended the abolition of the office. It was unnecessary for him, on the present occasion to make any preface on the importance of the motion with which he meant to conclude. The importance of the subject in the present condition of the country, and in the present state of public feeling, must be generally allowed. If it had been necessary to excite attention to the dis-

 Mr. C. Dundas  moved the second reading of this bill.
 Lord Nugent  was in favour of going into the committee. He did not think that the interests of the persons complaining would be materially affected by this bill; and such being the case, the House had a right to consider the public advantages that were likely to be derived from it.
 Mr. Bright  seconded the motion, and contended that it must prove eminently advantageous to the trade and navigation of the Thames, as well as to those parts of the country through which the intended canal was to flow.
 Mr. P. Moore  observed, that those who were favourable to this measure had given up the idea of making a cut to Eton; but still the canal would come within one mile of that college, and very great inconvenience would be the consequence of its approaching a place where a great number of young persons received their education. A very unpleasant intercourse, prejudicial to the morals and manners of the students, would be the result. The provost and fellows of Eton had also a wharf, which produced a considerable profit; and they were of opinion that the advantages which they derived from that wharf would be lost if the canal were formed.
 Mr. W. Dundas  opposed the motion, and defended the conduct of government in the appointment. The commissioners, he observed, had, in four short lines, without any reason assigned, decided against the appointment; but the judges, who had more experience of the business of the court, and who were men of unimpeachable integrity, had approved of it, and given their reasons for that approval.
 The Speaker  interposed. He suggested to the learned lord that no observations which might have been made by any hon. member ought to be called "an unfounded and illiberal attack," and that therefore the learned lord was not in order when he used the term.
 Sir John Newport  contended House were justified in distrust of his majesty's ministers this subject. Three cabinet ministers had voted in the first instance against the institution of a commission; but such a distrust, was further reasonable, because his majesty's ministers had done every thing in their power, first to delay, and afterwards to frustrate the objects of that commission. After the address which was voted had been carried to the foot of the throne, seven months elapsed before any thing was done in the business. At last the commission was appointed; but the learned lord had said that commission had traveled out of its jurisdiction in meddling at all with the constitution of the court, as regarded the judges. Now
 370 371 l. l., l. 372 373
 Mr. Baring  said, that a petition coming from so great and respectable a body as the Chamber of Commerce of Glasgow, deserved the most favourable attention from that House. Every efficient means ought to be taken to promote their reasonable objects; every consideration was due to their reasonable claims. When he had a few days ago presented a similar petition to that House, from the merchants and traders of London, he moved that it should he on the table, in order to see, in the mean time, what the other great commercial towns would be disposed to do. He did so, because he felt convinced that whatever might be the disposition of parliament, no great practical benefit could be accomplished without the general concurrence of the country at large. His hon. friend who had just presented the petition before them, differed from him, but in very few and inefficient points. The House, he said, must have heard with pleasure from his hon. friend, that some of the principal manufactures which had been for some time depressed, had, at least partially, revived. And he agreed with his hon. friend in thinking, that, however gloomy and unpromising appearances might be, there was yet no serious apprehension (if proper exertions were made) that the, commercial and manufacturing interests of this country would be endangered in any material degree. During the war an extraordinary impulse was given to the manufacturing interests of England—an extensive, but an artificial trade prevailed, which could not be kept up in a time of peace. That state of things must give way to one of a more moderate, but more solid and more natural kind. He concurred with his hon. friend, that if the House would encourage the commerce and manufactures of the country by good laws—by wise and liberal regulations, that they would again behold the revival of commerce and of general prosperity. But it was only by great efforts that such desirable objects could be accomplished; they were not to fall asleep over the state of the country; they were not to suppose,
 430 431
 Mr. Calcraft  said, that his hon. friend's motion had been much misrepresented by the noble lord, and that the utmost, extent of his proposition went only to show, that if the weight of expenditure which bore down the people did not admit of complete alleviation, it might at least be rendered more tolerable. But if any one had only heard the latter part of the noble lord's speech, he would be inclined to think his hon. and gallant, friend was demanding some sacrifice, attended with shame, if not with more ruinous consequences. Now, nothing was more contrary to his intention he only Called for a committee of inquiry, and that after entering into such a detail as must impress every, man with the necessity for its appointment. In one particular, he could not agree with his hon. friend; he alluded to that part of his speech, in which he proposed to lessen the number of the cavalry establishment. He thought it advisable to preserve the skeleton of this establishment by keeping up a number of dismounted cavalry, to provide for any future occasion, in which it might be necessary to recur to it. Generally, however, be, thought the House and the country were deeply indebted to his gallant friend for the laborious and useful duty he had undertaken and so very ably discharged. And if after showing even a probability pf saving several hundred thousand pounds a year to the country

 Colonel Davies  rose to direct the attention of the House to a subject at all times of the utmost importance, but. more peculiarly so at the present moment, when the country, labouring under the pressure of severe and accumulated distress, required every assistance which it was in the power of parliament to afford it. He felt that he must throw himself on the indulgence of the House, of which he certainly had need when he undertook the task of bringing under its consideration our existing military establishments, with a view to point out what might require amendment, and to suggest a remedy. He also felt, that in bringing forward this subject at the present time, he should have to encounter disadvantages and difficulties which, when he first turned his thoughts to it, he did not anticipate; for, however general the desire throughout the country might be to see some measure adopted, which should have for its object a retrenchment in the public expenditure, yet the unfortunate events which had lately occurred, had filled the minds of many with so much alarm, that however friendly they might be to the general principle of economy, he should find them at the outset, prejudiced against any proposition which could, by possibility, weaken the powers at the disposal of government. Yet, as his object was inquiry, and he should not presume to ask the House to adopt any definitive measures at his suggestion, he hoped, that all those who were friendly to economy, however much they might differ from him as to the extent of the danger by which we were threatened, would join in assisting to promote an inquiry, which could not possibly be attended with mischief, and might be productive of essential benefit to the country. Every thinking man who looked to the situation of this once flourishing country, and saw the misery which had overtaken every class of the

 Mr. Long  expressed his surprise, that the gallant officer should say, the paymaster general was no public accountant.
 Colonel Davies  denied that he had made any such statement.
 Mr. Long  observed, that if the gallant officer would take the trouble of inquiring, he would find that the paymaster general was one of the greatest public accountants in the country.
 Colonel Davies  again denied the statement imputed to him by the right hon. gentleman.
 Mr. Long  regretted his misconception of the gallant officer's words, assuring him that he had no disposition whatever to misinterpret any hon. member. But he was quite certain, that if the gallant officer would take the trouble of seeking accurate information, or would call at the office, and judge for himself, he would be convinced of his mistake in supposing that the business of the paymaster general's department could be consistently transferred to the war-office. The business of the paymaster-general's department was, indeed, of a very onerous description. The duties which were performed there were extremely various; the issue of the half-pay alone required considerable time and attention, especially in consequence of the arrangement for making that payment quarterly instead of half-yearly, as was the former custom. But the settlement of the different accounts in that department was attended with a great deal of trouble. Upon his (Mr. L.'s) introduction to this office, he found there was an arrear of unsettled accounts for no less than 25 years, nay since Mr. Burke's arrangement was adopted; and he had the satisfaction to say that all those accounts were now adjusted, and passed to the commission for auditing public accounts. This discharge of business accounted for the difference between the expence of the paymaster-general's department at the present day, compared with the period referred to by the gallant officer. But he would venture to say, that if the gallant officer would inquire and compare the present expense of this department with that incurred during the war, he would find that a greater reduction had taken place in that office since the conclusion of the peace, than in any other office concerned in the superintendence of the public expenditure. With regard to the superannuated allowances adverted to by the gallant officer, in no instance did any of those allowances exceed the amount settled by statute, while some of them fell short of that amount, as he (Mr. Long) showed by quoting the cases. When he became paymaster general, he found
 447
 Colonel Davies  thought there was cause to complain that the public accountants connected with the right hon. gentleman's department were not sufficiently under the control of that department.
 Mr. Long  observed, that the power of the office alluded to was amply sufficient for any effective purpose of control upon the conduct of every individual connected with the department.
 Colonel Davies,  in reply said that the statements he had made, and the arguments which he bad drawn from them, had been only met by the assertions of the hoble lord, which, however convincing or satisfactory to the House of Commons, could not be so to the country in general; With respect to the commission of military inquiry to which reference had been made by the noble lord, it had existed only during war. After entering into a recapitulation of the various topics he had urged in his opening speech he concluded by expressing his conviction that if the House would not be thought wholly inattentive to the interests of the country, they would promote an inquiry, which was calculated to effect so large a saving in the public expenditure.
 Colonel Grant  begged to offer some observations to the House as a military man. He objected to any decrease of the cavalry establishment, and contended that nothing was more useful than to keep up a large skeleton of officers and non-commissioned officers, who might be ready for active service upon future emergencies. In alluding to the forge-carts, which had been objected to on the ground of unnecessary expenditure, be observed, that they were on many occasions of the greatest service, and that much distress had been experienced from the want of them in the retreat of sir John Moore from Corunna. Adverting to the Tiding school, and to the number of staff employed he contended that they were both indispensable.
 Colonel Davies  rose to explain. It had never been his intention, in his allusion to the forge carts, to maintain that they were not necessary on foreign service. The gallant colonel had completely misunderstood him in supposing he considered this expense as unnecessary one on actual service.
 Mr. Ellice  said, he merely rose to state the grounds on which he meant to support the hon. member's motion for inquiry. To the various details of the question, whether regarding cavalry or infantry, he professed himself incompetent; but it was his wish to look a little beyond those details; and he thought that some inquiry ought to be made as to the necessity of keeping up the unheard-of military force now established in this country in a time of peace. He thought, too, that some
 459
 Mr. Ellice  presented a petition from certain Woollen Manufacturers of Hawick. He said, that after the discussion which had taken place on the petition presented by the member for Glasgow, and after the observations which had fallen from his hon. friend (Mr. Baring), he was induced to say one or two words on presenting the petition which he held in his hand. As an instance of the advantage which the public derived from the discussions which had taken place in that House, he had now the honour of presenting, for the first time, a petition from a numerous and respectable body of manufacturers, praying to be relieved from the general restrictions which were placed on the trade of the country; they complained of the great distress and difficulties under which they laboured; and were of opinion that the state of things was such as could not long
 432
 Mr. Finlay  said, he held in his hand a petition from the Chamber of Commerce of Glasgow, a body of gentlemen who were highly interested in the commercial prosperity of the country, praying the establishment of a free trade, and the removal of all restrictions upon commercial imports and exports. Upon a subject of such vital importance, he trusted the House would grant him its indulgence for a few moments. The presentation of a similar petition from the merchants of the city of London made it the more necessary that he should say a few words on the present occasion. The petitioners were of opinion, that the distresses of the commercial and manufacturing interests of this country were much increased, if not in a great measure caused by the various restrictions which impeded our imports from and exports to foreign countries. These restrictions having been so long continued in this country, led other nations into a belief that it was to such regulations we owed our prosperity, and thus induced them to, follow our example. The petitioners were of opinion, not only that such restrictions ought to be removed,

 Sir Henry Parnell  said, as the expenditure of the army amounted to nearly seven millions annually it became the House to consider whether or not some saving might not be effected, or, at all events, whether a committee should not be appointed to ascertain if it could be effected. An hon. friend of his had said, the noble lord was well paid for making an annual speech, but his hon. friend laid overrated the noble lord's deserts, for last year he made no speech; and on the army estimates being brought-down, referred the House merely to the dry details. The civil offices in the army department were, now in the fifth year of peace, greater than after the first four years of the last war. In the year 1792 one department cost 813 l.; l. 458 l. l.; l.; l;
 Lord Palmerston  observed, that he should not, upon the present occasion, anticipate the discussion of the army estimates which were so soon to be brought under the consideration of the House, but he thought it proper to make some remarks upon the statements or calculations of the gallant officer, in which, however, he should be as brief as possible. The gallant officer's animadversions upon the conduct of the several finance committees he should leave to other and more competent persons to answer; merely saying, that in his opinion those committees had performed their important duties with great zeal and ability. But with respect to the gallant officer's calculations upon our military expenditure, he must say, that he could not place much reliance upon their accuracy, from a recollection of the extreme erroneousness of the hon. officer's calculations on the same subject upon a former occasion. Upon the increase of our military establishment since the last year, which naturally gave vise to an increase of expenditure, he did not think it necessary to make any reply to the gallant officer, as the House and the country were fully aware of the reasons connected with our internal situation

 Mr. Hobhouse  apologized for the mistake, and fixed the motion for the 8th of June.
 Lord Castlereagh  moved the order of the day for the House to resolve itself into a committee on this bill. On the motion that the Speaker do leave the chair,
 Mr. Bennet  said, he wished, before the question was decided, to make a few observations; and, in the first place, he would state with regard to the notice he had given to move a clause in the committee for the exclusion of persons, from that House who received pensions, from the civil list, that he had abandoned that idea, and would proceed in a different way. He could not help expressing his surprise that ministers had thought proper to introduce the civil list to the House in the manner they had done; because he felt that it was neither advantageous to the Crown, nor befitting the present situation of the country. Let the House always bear it in view, that the civil list now, called for was founded on the report of a committee appointed by the ministers, of the Crown—they having, in the first; place, expressly refused the motion of his right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney), that persons, papers, and records, should be examined. The only persons, therefore, who were examined, were the ministers themselves; and now, without having any new information of any sort or kind laid before parliament, they thought fit to come down to the House and call for a civil list, exactly of the same amount, precisely in the same manner, and with the very identical machinery, as had been witnessed in 1816. He perfectly recollected the arguments used by the noble lord in 1816, and by the late Mr. Perceval in 1812. At those periods, when the different discussions on the civil list took place, ministers exclaimed, "Don't interfere with the question now; the time will come, and probably very soon, when the whole subject will be brought under the consideration of parliament." That time had come; and the way ministers now used the House was, to negative every motion for inquiry to deny every paper called for, and to refer them, forsooth, to the documents of 1816. He for one, considered the civil list as a great deal too large under any circumstances; but, under the existing circumstances of the country, it appeared to him to be so large that it must excite out of doors very unpleasant feelings. The House: would recollect that the civil list was constructed on the estimate of three of the most expensive years that had ever occurred, and

 Mr. Hobhouse,  in the absence of his hon. colleague (sit F. Burdett), wished to correct an error in the entry-book, as to a notice given: by the hon. baronet. It was supposed that he had given notice of a motion relative to the inquest at Oldham, but the intended motion would refer to the transactions at Manchester on the 16th of August last, and would be brought forward on the earliest open day after the holidays.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that, as far as; his knowledge extended, the emoluments of the office of lord-lieutenant were completely unequal to defray its necessary; expenses. One noble duke, lately deceased, who had held the situation, had crippled his fortune considerably, although the salary had been improved. Parliament, feeling that the salary was inadequate to support the dignity of the situation, had thought proper to raise it to; 30,000 l. l. l.
 Mr. C. Grant,  not having been in the House at the period alluded to by the right hon. baronet, could not express any opinion on the facts stated by him, but, from his connexion with Ireland, he felt himself called on to state, that the salary now allowed to the lord-lieutenant was not too great when they considered the dignity of the situation. It was, he believed, a well-known fact that the late duke of Richmond suffered severely in his private fortune in consequence of the smallness of his allowance. He could also state, that the late lord-lieutenant had said that the salary, though then increased to 30,000 l. 468
 Mr. Tierney  complained that they were called on to vote a sum of 850,000 l. l. l. l. 469 l. 470
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that as to the observation made, that the House had taw information; before them respecting the Irish civil list for coming to a decision, he apprehended they had. There had never been occasion to bring the civil list of Ireland before parliament with a view of calling for any supply to make up its deficiency. It had never been in debt; while the civil list of England had been several times under consideration, either with the view. Of supplying its deficiency, or with, the view of transferring some of its charges to other funds. Yet the civil list of Iceland had been brought under review. The sum of 225,000 l. 471 l. l. 472
 Mr. Tierney  said, he had never lent himself to any such proposition as that of the abolition of the office of lord lieu-
 474
 Mr. Baring  allowed, that it was not proper for an English member to interfere to propose the abolition of such an office as that of lord lieutenant of Ireland, and he thought, that whatever little pomp remained in the capital of Ireland, should not be abolished. But, he observed, in general, that propositions for the increase of the salaries of offices passed very easily in the House, and that during all the time he had sat there, he had never known any reduction of those salaries to be made. When 10,000 l. l. 475 l.
 Mr. Wellesley Pole  said, that his late right hon. friend Mr. Perceval had brought forward the motion for augmenting the salary of the lord lieutenant, after he had ascertained that no lord lieutenant could hold the office without expending double the sum allowed. The noble duke who then held the office was not aware of the investigation, and to any inquiry of the kind he would have turned a deaf ear. It was all done without his knowledge. It was thought unjust that the lord lieu-

 The Speaker,  on examining the entry-book, said, the notices appeared to be as its was now described.
 Sir George Warrender  proceeded to observe, that it was not intended to make any material difference between the vote of the last and the estimates of it was not intended to make any material difference between the vote of the last and the estimates of the present year. He believed the propriety of the addition which had been made to the marines was not likely to be called in question. On this occasion, he should only move for a vote, of the sum of 500,000 l. l. l. l. s. d. l. l. s. l. l. s. l. s. l.
 Sir Henry Parnell  contended, that the office of lord lieutenant of Ireland was al together as useless as it was expensive. He was of opinion that having separate governments for England and for Ireland, led to inconvenience and embarrassment. At present it was well known that a serious division existed between the members of the government of that country. To the present lord lieutenant and the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Grant) every thanks and gratitude were due. That right hon. gentleman had displayed both policy and liberality, integrity in his views, and conciliation in his manner; but he regretted to say that other members of the Irish government were not distinguished for similar virtues. He believed that the office1 of lord lieutenant, instead of an expence of 30,000 l, l.
 Sir H. Parnell  wished to be understood that he had not imputed the least blame to earl Talbot. As to the propriety of retaining the office of lord lieutenant, there was a difference in his opinion and that of his right hon. friend, of the view taken of that question in Ireland; and the difference was easily accounted for. His right hon. friend (Mr. W. Pole) had spent most of his time in the Castle at Dublin, where there was not a whisper, no doubt, against such an office. He (sir H. P.) on the other hand, spent most of his time in the country in Ireland, where he often heard the opinion that a change might advantageously take place in the executive government of Ireland. It was not his wish to abolish the office of lord lieutenant without finding a substitute; but he thought the business of the police of Ireland would be mach better managed by appointing lords lieutenants of counties, after the English system. Much difficulty was at present felt from the want of authorities in the different counties, to communicate with the government, as the governors of counties did not answer this purpose. Formerly there was a strong opinion in favour of the office of lord lieutenant, but at present the general opinion respecting it was much changed.
 Mr. Shaw  expressed his regret and astonishment to hear any Irish member; suggesting in that House, the policy of abolishing the office of lord lieutenant of Ireland. Dublin had suffered most severely by the Act of Union, and no saving that might follow the abolition of the office could be compared to the destruction which that measure would bring upon the citizens of Dublin. Every one at all acquainted with the state of Ireland, knew how much, and how severely she suffered by absentees, but if the office of lord lieutenant, the last remaining inducement for men of property to remain at home, was abolished, it would have the effect of banishing them altogether from Ireland.
 Sir John Newport  said, he had never entertained the idea of the abolition of the lord-lieutenancy, and begged not to be implicated in that charge.
 Sir J. Newport  said, there was not any thing like the same degree of splendor now kept up by the lord-lieutenant of Ireland as there had been at former periods when the salary was not so large. He would state further, that since the periods when the increase was granted, a great alteration had taken place in the state of the currency; so that 20,000 l. l. 467 l. l.
 Sir J. Newport  expressed a hope that some documents would be laid before the House with respect to the manner in which the civil list for Ireland was disposed of. He had called for certain  data l. l. l., l. l. 466 l.
 Mr. Curwen  said, he could not but deeply lament, that, in the present state of the country, ministers had not recommended and acted upon that system of economy, the necessity for which was so universally admitted. Instead of the measure now before them, he had hoped that ministers, on the part of the Crown, would have stated that a considerable diminution of the civil list expenditure was intended; because, however desirable it was to support the dignity of the Crown, still, at a period like the present, the sufferings and privations of the people ought to be attended to and removed as much as possible. With this feeling, he conceived the greatest ornament of the Crown at this moment would be economy and retrenchment. Everyman who felt the real state of the country must be convinced that its prosperity could alone be hoped for by considerably diminishing the public expenditure. He regretted that a proposition of that kind had not been made on the part of ministers, particularly with reference to the civil list. He conceived that a well-con-
 476
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that in 1815 a committee of the House of Commons investigated this branch of expenditure and recommended that the present allowances should be granted. That recommendation was acceded to without opposition; and the provision then suggested, and which was made on a general view of the subject, had been continued ever since. Prior to that period particular sums were granted for particular branches of expense to which our ambassadors were liable, but it was thought better to give a specific salary. He could assure the hon. member that the subject had undergone a great deal of consideration, with a view to the greatest possible economy, and at the same time to avoid impoverishing or embarrassing individuals employed as ambassadors. There were,
 477
 Mr. Philips  said, that the noble lord, in speaking of the salaries granted to our ambassadors, seemed to have forgotten the depreciated state of the currency when the last arrangement was made. The sum of 12,000 l. l. 478
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that when the arrangement was made, it was specifically agreed that our ambassadors should have a fixed salary, independent of any alteration in the currency. That salary was to cover all extraordinaries, and was not liable to be increased on account of any unfavourable fluctuation in the foreign exchanges. As to the hon. member's information relative to the payment of foreign ambassadors, he knew not the source from which he had derived it, and of course could not answer for its correctness.
 Mr. D. W. Harvey  said, the observations that had fallen from the hon. member afforded a further proof, of the necessity of that discussion and inquiry relative to the items of the civil list which had been so repeatedly called for by gentle-men on his side of the House, and as repeatedly refused by the gentlemen opposite. A committee had, it appeared, sat in 1815, and it was said that their decision proceeded on such grounds, that there could be no mistake in the correctness of their calculations. It was, however, properly replied, that the government had stripped that committee of all those powers which could alone enable them to perform their duties effectually. The hon. member for Taunton had truly stated, that ministers had prevented a. close, vigorous, and efficient investigation of every part of the civil list expenditure, and had refused to the committee those facilities by the use of which alone they could hope to arrive at a just conclusion. But, supposing, in 1815, a committee, clothed with such power as would have enabled them to have properly examined the subject, had been appointed, still a fresh inquiry was, he contended, necessary, because the two periods were wholly dissimilar, and the state of the country now was far more critical.
 Mr. Monck  observed, that the allowances granted to our ambassadors and envoys were extravagant and enormous. He did not wish the country to be niggardly towards those individuals, but he conceived that it would not be derogatory to the dignity of this government if they were put on the same footing as one of the greatest monarchs of Europe—he meant the king of France—placed the ambassadors of that nation. He was credibly Informed that there were but two classes of French ambassadors, the higher and the interior. The members of the first class were paid 6,000 l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l.
 Mr. Monck  said, he had derived his information from a French gentleman who was in the diplomatic line.
 Sir R. Wilson  said, that having had an opportunity of seeing our ambassadors in other countries, he thought it but an act of candour to say, that there were claims made on the hospitality of the English ambassadors which were not made on the ambassadors of any other court.
 Mr. Philips  expressed his satisfaction at finding that petitions of this kind were presented from such extensive manufacturing, districts as those of Manchester and its vicinity. It was a convincing proof of the progress of information on the true principle of commercial policy. It was to be lamented that, while such respectable bodies were proceeding thus, another body of persons, the agriculturists, should continue to, call for separate protection and relief. He regretted to find that the exploded doctrine of partial protection should still be adhered to by any one set of persons in the country. It was impossible that any such protection, extended exclusively to one branch of society, should not injure not only itself, but the other branches also. He was of opinion
 479
 Mr. Grenfell,  although decidedly averse to the wild theory of which so much had been lately said, and which was termed "parliamentary reform," had no hesitation in declaring his unqualified approbation of the bill, as far as it went to disfranchise the borough of Grampound; and that opinion he had stated the first moment the subject came before the House The leaning of his mind was in favour of transferring the elective right either to the
 510
 Mr. Davies Gilbert  bore testimony, from local and personal knowledge, to the respectability of the freeholders of the two hundreds to which it was proposed to extend the right of voting for the future representatives of Grampound, declaring that he had no doubt, upon such an arrangement, the members would the returned for, that district upon such an arrangement the members would be returned for that district upon as independent principles as for any county in England. He was decided advocate for the principle of representation upon property for than population; and he though that the signal merit of the representation no in that House was, that it did not amount to a, direct delegation from the people; for it would be impossible for an assembly controlled by the mass of the people to be co-existent with any other, branch of the constitution The events of the few last years had sufficiently proved
 511
 Lord Castlereagh,  in explanation, said, that he was under the necessity of pursuing the course in Ireland alluded to by the hon. baronet, in order to settle the competition between the different boroughs.
 Mr. D. Gilbert  explained. He thought that the hon. member could want no assistance from any one to understand the nature of the Cornish boroughs, because, if he was not mistaken, the hon. gentleman had first entered that House as member for Grampound.
 Lord John Russell,  in reply, observed, that he had but a very few words to offer tbthe1 House. He had heard, with great pain the declaration of the noble lord opposite, and he did hope to have heard him, in the course of the debate, retract: what he had said; but in that expectation he was disappointed. At the end of December last, the noble lord would recollect, that he (lord John Russell) had given notice of his intention to bring in a bill to transfer the right of voting from Grampound to Leeds. Not one word of objection was, upon that occasion offered by the noble lord; but he did understand
 519 l. 520
 Lord Castlereagh  rose to explain. He was fearful that some misunderstanding had occurred between himself and the noble lord: at the same time he had no wish to conceal his real sentiments upon the point to which the noble lord had alluded. He could have wished that the noble lord had felt himself at liberty to remodel his bill upon the principles observed in former cases: but he must contend that he had acted with every public and private candour towards the noble lord.
 The Attorney General  presented a petition from John Eyles, Warden of the Fleet, stating, that during the last parliament, in consequence of an order issued by the then Speaker of the House of Commons, he had liberated from confinement in the Fleet prison Robert Christie Burton, esq., claiming privilege of parliament as member for the borough of Beverley. He, the warden, had since
 521
 Mr. Hobhouse  gave notice, that on the 15th of June, he would submit to the House a resolution respecting the right assumed by judges of preventing, by imprisonment and fine, the publication of proceedings in a court of justice. He was sorry that so important a subject should be brought forward by one so little competent to recommend it to the consideration of the House; but he felt himself bound, unless some hon. member of greater weight, or more extensive legal knowledge, would undertake the task, to submit a motion on the subject to the House.
 Lord J. Russell  moved, that the order of the day for the second reading of the Grampound Disfranchisement bill be now read; which having been done, his lordship moved, "that the resolutions of that House, of the 5th of July last, be read." The clerk read the resolutions, as follow:— nem. con.
 Lord J. Russell  then said, that lie felt it necessary, in this stage of the bill which he had been instructed to bring forward, to state briefly the result of the examination which had induced the House to come to the resolutions that had just been read. Those who were in the late parliament would recollect, that a petition had been presented against the return of the members for the borough of Grampound, and that the committee to whom the petition was referred had made a report imputing gross corruption to many of the electors in that borough, and the result was, that the law officers of the Crown were ordered to institute prosecutions against those electors. Subsequently, copies of the indictments on which 23 of the voters of Grampound had been found guilty were laid before the House, together with other documents connected with the election. On these grounds he moved that the House should go into a committee on the abuse of the elective franchise in Grampound. That proposition was immediately assented to by the noble lord opposite, and the committee was appointed. On proceeding with the inquiry, it was clearly proved, by the evidence of Mr. Teed, that instructions had been given by sir Manasseh Lopez to distribute sums of money to the electors of Grampound, so as to secure a majority of them. It was also proved, by an individual who belonged to Grampound, that he had seen sir M. Lopez on this subject; and that he had informed him of his having collected together a number of voters who were ready to receive his money, and in return to give him their votes. That number, it appeared, was objected to by the agent of sir Manasseh, because it did not comprise a majority of the electors. The witness stated, that a number, constituting a majority, was afterwards collected, and that each of the parties received thirty-five pounds as the price of his vote, a sum with which several of them expressed themselves dissatisfied. It further appeared, that in consequence of this dissatisfaction they gave their votes in favour of other persons. It seemed, that one of the electors had got a list, containing the names of 62 persons who had the right to vote, and of whom 58 had voted; of these 58 no less than 47 had the sum of 35 l. 482 l. l. l. l. l., 483 l. l. 484 485 * * 486 487 488 l. 489
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that although he had no intention to oppose the second reading; he felt it due to the noble lord, and to the House, to offer some observations on the subject. Whatever steps might afterwards be taken, he thought this the convenient moment for making a few observations on the principles involved in the bill. He should endeavour to imitate the noble lord, who had in the most candid and fair manner stated his views of the question, and the object he proposed to himself in this bill; and if he could not agree entirely with the noble lord, it would be from a different view taken by him of the local circumstances of the borough of Grampound. As far as the principle of the measure was concerned, so far as it was opened by the noble lord, there was no difference of opinion between them. That was, he agreed with the noble lord, that where it was proved satisfactorily that persons having an elective franchise had abused that trust, measures should be taken to protect the security of election and purity of election against the repetition of such abuse. Any difference of opinion arose not from any alterations proposed to be made in the elective franchise in Grampound, because, after the election committee had made their report, he had concurred in promoting further inquiry, and after that inquiry he had concurred in a resolution which stood on their records without a dissentient voice—that further measures were called for by the corruption detected in the borough of Grampound. Up to this point he and the noble lord understood
 490 pro tanto; 491 492 493 494 l., 495
 Mr. Tierney  said, he heard with some surprise and great sorrow, the speech of the noble lord. When the resolutions were brought forward by his noble friend, containing a declaration of the principle on which the House would act in case of boroughs convicted of corrupt practices, viz. by transferring the right of election to populous towns, the noble lord had undoubtedly objected to the declaration of such a general principle; but he (Mr. T.) had understood the noble lord to say, that if his noble friend would confine himself to the particular case of Grampound, he should not be adverse to that mode of proceeding: and he was confirmed in his opinion, that such was the impression produced by the words of the noble lord, by a recollection of the eagerness with which he (Mr. T.) had urged his noble friend to close with the proposition of the noble lord, and to accept of a certain advantage rather than endeavour in vain to get more.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he felt it to be due to the right hon. gentleman to prevent his reasoning on a misapprehension, by reminding him that he had distinctly reserved his opinion, on the ground that he was not acquainted with the local circumstances of Grampound.
 Mr. Tierney  continued.—He certainly had understood the noble lord at first to agree to his noble friend's proposition. In two or three days, however, the noble lord came down, and in a more guarded manner reserved to himself the right of subsequently expressing it as his opinion that the proposed reform should be of a more gradual kind—that the elective franchise should be given to some of the hundreds in the vicinity of Grampound. The ground of this was, that the innocent might not be punished with the guilty. What he had wished, and he believed this was the wish and the hope of many others and a very large portion too, in the country, was, that a measure, which, at the moment it was known seemed to give general satisfaction, should be carried into effect. It would be useless to deny, that at the moment this proposition was introduced, and was supposed to have received
 496 497 498 499 500 501
 Mr. Wynn  observed, that after the gross corruption which had been-proved to exist in Grampound, he was glad there was no difference of opinion in the-House as to the necessity of some remedy, and he hoped that the present parliament
 502 503 s. s.
 Mr. Bathurst  thought that the question; had hot been placed in the true point of view. It was admitted that some measure was required in order to prevent the recurrence of those practices which had, up to a certain point, prevailed in the borough of Grampound. It was not necessary, however, for that purpose, that the borough should be disfranchised. The; ordinary practice in such cases had been to admit a certain number of new voters,

 Mr. Hobhouse  said, that although this debate had been protracted beyond the time, which, he presumed, it was originally intended to occupy, yet he would beg leave to detain the House a little longer, in order to say a few words which might explain his reasons for supporting the motion of the noble lord. As right hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House had thought it due to themselves, and due to their characters for fairness and candour, to state the reasons of their support to the measure before the House, he trusted they would allow him, in justice to his own character for fairness and candour, to make the same explanations, although they would proceed upon principles totally different from those of the right hon. gentlemen. Upon the present occasion, he thought the House did perfectly right in recognizing, as a principle, that the representation of the people wanted some reform. He should himself have taken the opportunity of submitting a similar proceeding to them before, if he had not thought that the noble lord who introduced the bill might have lost as much by his (Mr. Hobhouse's) alliance in that House as he had lost in the country by the alliance of the noble lord oppo-
 517
 Mr. A. Moore,  in contending for the propriety of this bill going to a Commit—tee, reviewed the various objections which had been taken to it by hon. gentlemen, and the propositions which had grown out of it. Some of those objections

 Lord Stanley  bore testimony to the respectability of the petitioners. He hoped that their liberal and enlightened views on the subject of our commercial policy would be acted upon. Whenever any

 Mr. Canning  said, that if the intended and avowed purpose of the bill had been merely to disfranchise the borough of Grampound, and if it had been left to be filled up in the committee by what mode the vacancy thus occasioned in the representation was to be supplied, he should not have expressed any opinion in the
 505 few 506 l. 507 508 l. l. l. l. 509
 Mr. Sumner  fully concurred in the arguments of the noble lord, and of those gentlemen who supported the bill. He thought that such a measure was absolutely necessary at present. In reply to the clamour which was so much heard out of doors, it had often been said, "Show us the particular evil or imperfection of which you complain, and; see whether we will not apply a remedy." Now Grampound was this case: here was art evil admitted on all hands to exist; and he conceived that they would be given but too just a ground for some of the charges which were made (he thought unjustly) against them, if they did not deal with the present case as it deserved.
 504
 Mr. Blackburne  presented a Petition from the merchants, manufacturers, and other inhabitants of Manchester, praying a removal of those restrictions by which our commercial intercourse with other nations was impeded.
 Mr. Warre  observed, that it required no great sagacity to foresee that the fate of this bill would be like that of many other bills of a similar nature, upon which ministers had smiled in the first instance, but from which they had afterwards withdrawn their support. The noble lord opposite would take no measure in favour of parliamentary reform, unless, driven to it by necessity. The noble lord would not agree to carry a single particle of elective franchise out of Cornwall, unless the county were so full that there was no longer room to put a member into it. He (Mr. Warre) was an enemy to all wild and sweeping plans of reform; but they who considered the present system of representation so all wise and all perfect as to admit of no improvement, erred in the other extreme, and he was anxious to avoid extremes of every kind. No one could deny that a
 513
 Mr. Beaumont,  in explanation of his proposition, stated, that the wish just expressed by the hon. member for Surrey was that which he contemplated, namely, that in order to give Yorkshire its due share in the representation, there should be two members for the West Riding, instead of those now returned for Gram-pound; and that upon the next proved case of delinquency in any other borough there should be two members also for the North and East Ridings. Hence a due share of influence on the representation would be given to the manufacturing and agricultural interests, for he had no desire to grant any undue ascendancy to either, and it was obvious that the two members for the West riding would be returned by the manufacturing interest, while it was equally obvious that the members for the other Ridings would be returned by the agricultural or landed interest.
 Mr. William Smith  rose for the purpose of calling the attention of the noble lord opposite to a point which had been urged by his hon. friend the member for Water-ford, and which the noble lord had not satisfactorily explained. In answer to his hon. friend's argument, founded on the course pursued by the noble lord at the period of the Union with Ireland, the noble lord had alleged that in that case he had been compelled to select. Some members were to be retained, others to be rejected; and population and taxation had been made the criterion; but, if that principle for selection was not the best that could be adopted, why did the noble lord then make choice of it? The noble lord had borne testimony to the soundness of that principle in a way which he would find it extremely difficult to get rid of. When he (Mr. William Smith) recollected that Cornwall at the present moment returned 44 members to that House, he could not but consider it highly objectionable that the elective privilege taken from Grampound should be retained within that
 514 l. s.
 Mr. W. Smith  allowed that he did, certainly, thirty years ago, represent a Cornish borough; and if he were to state the mode in which he had been returned for that borough, perhaps the manner of his election would not be sanctioned by the public approbation.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  obtained leave to bring in a bill to repeal so much of the 39th Elizabeth, the 21st; James 1st, the 4th and 9th George 1st, and the 5th, 6th, 8th, 26th, and 27th of George 2nd, as enacted capital punishments on crimes specified therein. Also a bill to repeal so much of the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary, the 18th Charles 2nd, the 9th George 1st, and the 12th George 2nd, chap. 29, as enacted capital punishments on the commission of certain offences specified therein.—The hon. and learned member then said, that he had on a former occasion given notice of a bill to consolidate the laws on forgery; he would now, with the leave of the House, withdraw that notice, and move for leave to bring in a bill "for mitigating the severity of punishment in certain cases of forgery and the crimes connected therewith; and also for more effectually detecting the forgery of notes or bills of the Bank of England."—The notice was withdrawn, and leave given to bring in the bill. The hon. and learned member then brought in the bill, which, with the two already mentioned, were read a first time.
 Sir John Newport  was of opinion that the concluding observations of the hon. member who last spoke, were not called for by the subject under discussion. He thought that the House was bound to examine in what part of the country the greatest portion of the people ought to be represented; and he objected to throwing the borough of Grampound into the adjoining hundreds, upon the ground that the county of Cornwall was already more than sufficiently represented. It mattered little whether the members returned were chosen by the inhabitants of Grampound or by those of the adjacent hundreds; they were still members for the county of Cornwall, and would, in the execution of their parliamentary duties, look especially to the interests of that county. In the present case, an occasion offered for letting in a part of that large portion of the people who were insufficiently represented; and he thought that the House was bound to avail itself of the opportunity. In what quarter of the kingdom did the want of adequate representation more decidedly exist than in Yorkshire? The noble lord opposite had said that he did not consider amount of numbers and contribution in the way of taxation as affording a ground for superior representation. He was surprised at hearing such a proposition from the noble lord, when the noble lord himself in the case of the Union between Ireland and this country, had acted directly upon a contrary principle. Upon that occasion it had been matter of arrangement, in selecting those places which should be struck off and those which should be represented, that the numbers

 Mr. Wynn  said, that if the House allowed in this case time for offering new securities, they must allow it in every other case, and petitions might be presented to the House on the very last day of the period described for recognizances, in order to obtain further time to substantiate securities. He knew nothing of the securities in this case, but it appeared probable, from the statement of the hon. baronet, that they would be ultimately rejected. It was fair, however, to allow further time to produce affidavits to establish the securities already offered. The hon. gentleman referred to a decision of the House in a similar case last year.
 Sir J. Stewart  was of opinion that this was a case which did not justify the introduction of a formal motion with respect to it. Neither of the individuals who had been proposed as securities were fit to be received in that capacity. One of them was in the service of an eminent distiller; and the other" was a young man, without house or property. These facts were sworn to by many respectable persons; the affidavits were on the table, and he could see no reason for re-examining those persons.
 Mr. Curwen  was of opinion that a committee should be appointed, to inquire into the state of the farmers; for if some alleviation of their burthens did not take I place, the growth of corn must be checked, and we should be left entirely at the mercy of the foreign grower. He hoped that, whenever the committee should be appointed, it would consist of both interests; for if it were confined to one, the country would look upon it as of that kind from which no benefit could be derived.
 Mr. Coke,  of Norfolk, thought that the system of taxation which had been so long pursued was the chief cause of that distress and depression which were felt by the farmers and other classes. He agreed that the farmer should be allowed a fair remunerative price for his produce;

 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that as the document now called for was a public one, he had no objection to the production of it. He trusted that no hon. member would at present enter on the subject, as it might lead to a premature discussion, which, on a question like the present, had better be avoided.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that in consequence of what had fallen from the hon. and learned gentleman who had spoken last, he thought it necessary to caution those who were not intimately acquainted with the subject against deciding rashly that the representation of Scotland must necessarily be defective, because it differed from that of England. The two systems might differ materially, and yet each be well adapted to the circumstances of the respective countries.
 Sir R. Fergusson  expressed his obligation to his noble friend for bringing forward a subject so disgraceful to Scotland. The caution of his hon. and learned friend not to consider a general reform of the representation of England as necessarily connected with an alteration of the county representation of Scotland, was highly proper; because the two systems were wholly dissimilar in principle and in practice. The other caution of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer savored too much of party principle; and he hoped the House would not, in the decision of such a question, be actuated by party views.
 Mr. Bathurst  said, that since the con stitution allowed absent persons to be elected, it would be hard to disqualify them on account of their absence, since any person who chose might insert in a petition that the person so elected was not duly qualified. He was for the original motion.
 Mr. Courtenay  said, that if the petitioner at the time of the election, had called for the production of the qualification, the present difficulty would have been avoided. [Mr. Tierney—"He could not; Mr. Antrobus was not present"] Be that as it might, the right hon. gentleman, he apprehended, was in a mistake when he said the House was called on to dispense with an act of parliament; for, as far as he recollected, the provision in question was not contained in an act, but in a resolution of that House. When a petition was offered against the return of a member, he was bound, within fifteen days, to give in the terms of his qualification, in order that the petitioner might have the best means of opposing him. Now all that was asked at present was, not that the qualifications should be withheld, but that the agent might be allowed to give in the terms of it, in the unavoidable absence of the member himself; and by that course no inconvenience could arise either to the sitting member or to the other parties, nor could he see any of those evil consequences which the right hon. gentleman apprehended.
 Mr. Calcraft  opposed the motion. If a
 542
 Mr. Robinson  said, that in the case which the hon. member had supposed, of a candidate's qualification not being satisfactory, that candidate could not be elected, and therefore the evils apprehended could not occur. The hon. gentleman seemed to anticipate that the con sequence of the House acceding to the present motion would be one seriously affecting the constitution of the House. He appeared to think that to dispense with the standing orders of the House upon the present occasion, would be to act in also lute opposition to the reluctance which they at other times manifested to permit any infringement. Thus he had instanced their determination not to permit the interference of any peer in elections; but here was the difference of the cases—that in the latter, instance, to dispense with the standing orders of the House would be to do so to their own wrong; but the question before the House at that moment was that such dispensation should be permitted in order to do right to another. He therefore, thought that as I good and as solid grounds had been laid for such a deviation from forms as could possibly be adduced.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  concurred in the opinion that this was a matter requiring attentive consideration; and therefore in order to afford members an opportunity of giving it every attention, he should move that the further consideration of the motion be adjourned until tomorrow.
 Mr. Calcraft,  although he supposed there could be no doubt that such a person as Mr. Antrobus really existed, maintained that it was clear he had been described as resident in a place where he did not reside This was a point of great importance, and he felt obliged to the right hon. gentleman who had proposed to adjourn the further consideration of the debate.
 Mr. Courtenay  begged to call the attention of the House to a singular case, and one which he considered to be much stronger than that which had just come before them. At the last election for the borough of Boston a gentleman of the name of Ellis had been returned by a considerable majority. The validity of this election was petitioned against by the other candidate, who represented that Mr. Ellis was ineligible under the Grenville act. The consideration of this petition stood for the 6th of June, but it was physically impossible for Mr. Ellis, and that without any imputation of negligence upon his part, to appear by that day. What he should wish would be, that the House should postpone the consideration to a day, the earliest at which it might be possible for Mr. Ellis to be heard. There was this difference between this case and that which had been just submitted to the House; namely, that Mr. Ellis had no agent in this country at all—no one to appear for him. By the 6th of June, there could be no person present to say who should be nominee for Mr. Ellis. It was on these grounds that he should move to postpone the hearing of this petition to some more distant day. The House were in possession of the grounds on which this gentleman's return was opposed: it was, that Mr. Ellis was supposed to have held an office under the Crown coming under the description of offices created since the statute of queen Anne, in consequence of which he was disqualified. It was not his intention to dispute this position, for he believed that that office would be held a disqualification; but at the same time he was far from believing that it was a disqualification against which there might not be good grounds of defence, and it was known that many cases where such defence had been pleaded had arisen under
 545
 Lord Archibald Hamilton  rose in pursuance of the motion of which he had given notice. As he understood that no opposition was to be made to it, he should content himself with stating the nature of the document for which he intended to move, and the reason which induced him to move for its production. The document which he wished to be laid before the House was a document containing the number of persons entitled to vote for counties in Scotland: it was annually made up, and therefore could be obtained without the slightest difficulty. The object for which he wanted it was to afford assistance to himself and to the House in the discussion of a question which he was inclined, from a sense of duty, to submit without delay to their most serious consideration. He believed that it was not generally known in the House on what the right of voting for county members rested in Scotland; and
 537
 Mr. Ricardo  said, that the object of the petitioners seemed to him to be nothing else than to get a monopoly of the English market. The consequence would be, that the price of corn would be raised, and laid generally on all the other classes. The idea which the petitioners had of protecting duties was a most erroneous one, and would, if acted upon, be destructive of all commerce. If they meant that the countervailing duties should be equal in amount to the difference between the price at which corn could be sold here and that at which it was sold in a foreign market, they went upon a most erroneous principle, and one which, he hoped, would never be introduced. Suppose corn sold here at 80 s. s. s. s.
 Mr. Sumner  said, it had not been his intention to offer any. observations on this subject, or to promote a partial de bate on its merits; but having been alluded to in the observations of the noble lord, he felt it necessary to say a few words in explanation of the object of his intended motion. His object was of a double nature. The first part of it would be exclusively applied to the protecting duty, as it was now fixed. It would be recollected that, in consequence, of an inquiry into this subject in 1815, the legislature had fixed 80 s.
 Mr. Tierney  observed, that the act of parliament explicitly declared, that no person should have a seat in that House who did not possess certain qualifications, and who did not swear to those qualifications, if called onto do so, at the time of his election. This person, it seemed, was at present in America; and if his absence were to free him from the necessity of proving his qualification, a precedent would be established by which persons in the East Indies might be elected, who might continue absent for three years. He observed that in the return this person was designated as residing at Hyde-Park-corner, and if that address were correct, it could easily be ascertained whether he was duly qualified or not. He would not state his opinion on the question at present—he only wished to show that there were difficulties on all hands. The act clearly specified that the qualification was to be given in within fifteen days after notice, and, without violating the provisions of this act, the House could not agree to the
 541
 Mr. Tierney  said, that as it had been thought proper that the other motion should be adjourned, he saw no reason why this should not take the same course.
 Mr. Fynes  stated to the House the circumstances which had given rise to the petition which he had presented on Thursday from Mr. Green, the agent of Mr. Antrobus. Mr. Antrobus, who had been returned for the borough of Aldborough, was in America on public business at the time of his election, and had not yet returned. A peti-
 540
 Mr. Fynes  remarked, that the only difficulty which occurred to him was this: the term which was limited by the standing order of the House for the consideration of these matters expired that day. It might be a question, therefore, how far such a circumstance might affect the proposition of the chancellor of the exchequer.
 Mr. Abercromby  thought that a question of greater importance to Scotland could hardly be brought before the House. The distinction which his noble friend had made, between lands held beneficially and those held by superiority, was well founded; but he thought the view which his hon. friend behind him had taken of the subject was not so important as he imagined, because his noble friend had no intention of bringing forward any motion for destroying existing rights. The object of his noble friend was, an extension of the elective franchise in Scotland; and, when the House had been informed of the actual number of voters at present, some measure, he trusted, would be proposed to them, founded on the extension of property and the diffusion of wealth. Some gentlemen might be in the habit of thinking that it was dangerous to change any part of the representative system of the country, as they imagined that the representation of England could not be altered for the better; but he would desire those persons, before they made up their minds on this subject, to consider what was the nature and the extent of representation
 539 s. l.
 Mr. Abercromby  thought that in the present case, by adhering to the standing orders of the House, they would frustrate the ends of justice. He wished that, instead of the present motion, the hon. mover had proposed that the petition should stand over to the next session, especially as the whole of the petitions could not be gone through in the course of the present. He should vote for the motion, but should have preferred the postponing of the petition altogether.
 Mr. Abercromby  observed, upon what had been just remarked by an hon. member, that it was in his power to say there was such a person as Mr. Antrobus, and that he had no doubt he usually lived at Hyde-Park-corner; and if he (Mr. Abercromby) were obliged to describe that individual's residence, he should say it was at that place; but the fact, as it was stated by every person, was this, that Mr. Antrobus was not now at Hyde-park-corner, but in America.
 Mr. Benett,  of Wiltshire, could not agree with the last speaker that it was the wish of the petitioners that an entire prohibition should be made against foreign importation. They did not think that a free importation of foreign corn should be allowed. They conceived, and it seemed to him that they were justified in thinking, that they ought to be allowed those fair protecting duties which were given to other classes; but for doing this, they were accused of illiberality and ignorance of the general principles of commerce. As far as he knew, the object of the agriculturists was not to increase corn to a great height, but to keep it at a steady remunerating price. At present the price was not sufficient to pay taxation and poor-rates. It would be idle to say that the price of corn was the cause of distress among the poor. That distress was occasioned
 536
 Mr. Hume  said, that he had himself seen a roll in which that distinction had been made.
 Mr. Hume  could not help suggesting to the noble lord, that it might greatly assist his ulterior object, if a distinction were made in the roll, between those superiorities which were mere paper supe-
 538
 Mr. P. Moore  supported the motion, and could not conceive why the inquiry should either be referred to a committee or postponed when they had all the documents before them.
 Mr. P. Moore  found many grounds for supporting the objections which had been taken upon this occasion. It was almost alleged that there was no such person in existence as Mr. Antrobus [a laugh]; there might indeed be such an individual, but on the other hand it was at least requisite, if there were, that his description should be exactly stated.
 Mr. P. Moore  presented a petition from Mr. Alderson, the agent of a number of electors of the town of Drogheda, which disclosed the following facts:—That James Sweeney, William Moore, and other voters, had, on the 8th of May, caused a petition to be presented to the House, complaining of the return of Henry Metcalfe, esq., to serve in parliament for the borough of Drogheda, and that the House had appointed Tuesday, the 6th of June, to consider the said petition. On the 8th of May, two sureties were ordered to be provided, who were to enter into recognizances for the prosecution of the said petition, in conformity with the act of the 53rd of his late majesty. On the 12th of May, the present petitioner received from Ireland the names of the proposed recognizances, which he immediately notified to the examiner. On Saturday last, he attended the said examiner according to notice, when Mr. Rowland, the agent of Mr. Metcalfe, put in several affidavits, denying the validity of the security which had been tendered. Not knowing whether the complaint extended to only one or to both of the securities, petitioner prayed for time to inquire into the fact, which was granted until this day. He now stated, that he believed the securities proffered to be good and valid; and if further time were given, and copies of the affidavits were allowed, he had no doubt that he could give a full and sufficient answer to the allegations that had been advanced against the securities. Petitioner had applied to
 531
 Mr. Denman  had one other objection to make, which, he conceived to be of considerable consequence, namely, that in case Mr. Antrobus should not come home till that time twelve months, it might happen that he would not be bound, by the
 543
 Mr. Denman  did not find that a similar proceeding had ever taken place on a former occasion, and therefore he submitted to the House whether it would not be proper to refer the matter to a committee, which should be instructed to examine into the practice of the House in the case of members being-elected in their absence from the country. If such a proceeding; as the present was not strictly examined, persons might be elected who did not possess the requisite qualifications, or who held previous appointments which disqualified them.
 Mr. W. Williams  said, he had always considered a question of this sort one of the greatest constitutional questions ever entertained in that House. It resolved itself into this—whether because Mr. Ellis had chosen to be absent from England for two or three years together, the representation of England was not, therefore, in the mean time to be filled up. He should beg to propose that this debate fee adjourned till to-morrow.
 The Speaker  said, it was perfectly true, that this was the last day which according to the standing orders, was appropriated for these petititions, but at the same time the House must be quite aware, that it was competent for them, without substantially infringing the order of the day, to remedy an inconvenience which they
 544
 The Speaker  said, that the case alluded to by the hon. member, referred only to further time for establishing the securities offered. The House were aware that the period allowed for entering into recognizances was 14 days; but in ail cases from Ireland, 14 days more were allowed
 533
 Sir G. Clerk  observed, that the scheme which had been suggested by the hon. member who had spoken last, was not practicable, because in the books in which the names of the voters were enrolled, there was nothing from which it could be determined whether the rent was reserved or not. The distinction which the hon. member wished to draw could only be obtained by the examination of every individual voter for a county in Scotland.
 Sir J. Newport  observed, that the present petition was one of considerable importance to the electors in every part of Ireland. It must be quite manifest to the House, that the elections on the other side of the channel were, in various points of view, different from what they were here. It was much more easy to know, if securities were rejected, whether the grounds of rejection were good, when individuals were on the spot, than where they came from a distant part of the empire. The petitioner in the present instance stated, that he believed, or. examination, the sureties would be found satisfactory; and he wished to introduce other affidavits, contradicting the facts stated on the other side, for the purpose of correcting the impression they, seemed to have made on the examiner; or, if that were refused, he prayed that he might be allowed to bring forward other sureties, which appeared to
 532
 Sir J. Newport  said, that the act precisely provided that the qualification should be given in within fifteen days, and therefore the petition could not be postponed without violating the spirit and letter of the act.
 Lord Milton  presented a petition from certain owners and occupiers of land in the county of York. It was, he observed, one of the numerous petitions on the part of the agriculturists complaining of the distresses and depressions tinder which they laboured, and praying for relief. He was fully aware that the complaint of distress was not only well founded, but was particular deserving the attention of the House. At the same time he admitted that any interference by the legislature in the price of human food was a subject which should be touched with great delicacy. The petitioners attributed their distresses to the competition of the foreign markets against them, and they prayed that protection from such competition which was enjoyed by the commercial and manufacturing branches. How far the inquiry, a notice of motion for which had been given by an hon. member (Mr. Sumner), was intended to go on this important subject, he was not aware—whether it was to be limited to an inquiry into the capacity of the farmer to bear those burthens to which he washable, or to go more generally into the nature of those burthens which affected all other classes, and of which the farmer, like others, felt the weight. If the object of the hon. member was the more limited one which he had mentioned, he apprehended it would only be considered by the people at large as an attempt to enhance the value of lands, and to raise the price of their produce; but if the inquiry should not only go to the agricultural distress, but to the general distress which affected the whole body of the trading part of the country, then he thought that considerable good might be
 534
 Lord Milton,  on a question so important as the present, felt it necessary to look at the objects and views of the petitioners. He had before stated, that he would not then declare whether he would or would not vote for the appointment of a committee. When that subject came before the House, the way in which he should give his vote would depend upon the nature of the objects which the movers might have in view, upon the members who were to constitute the committee into which it was proposed to enter, and upon the subjects into which the committee were to be empowered to investigate.
 Mr. Courtenay  presented a petition, signed by certain dealers and venders of newspapers. The petitioners complained that in consequence of the great increase of the Sunday newspapers, and their being exposed for sale on that day, much injury had been
 600
 Sir R. Heron  said, that the question before the House was one of the greatest importance, and one with which the House ought not to interfere upon grounds so slender as those advanced by the hon. gentleman who made the motion. The hon. gentleman principally relied on two grounds; first, the absence of Mr. Ellis; and, secondly, that the House could not anticipate a case which would come before a committee. If the last ground were tenable, the House had in fact no case before them at present. It was argued last night, and he believed it was the opinion of most members present, that if the qualification of the absent candidate were called for and not produced at the election, he could not be legally returned; but at the Boston election, the qualification of Mr. Ellis had been demanded, and the returning officer, after consulting with
 602
 Mr. Wynn  was sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but he thought he was pursuing a very extraordinary course in calling upon the House to discuss the merits of the case in the present stage. That should be the business of a committee.
 Sir R. Heron  was obliged to the hon. member for setting him right; but he conceived he was driven into the observations which he had made by the application of the hon. gentleman opposite. He thought it right to refer all to the committee. He was able to prove, by  viva voce
 Mr. Courtenay  said, that this was a petion which had been fixed for consideration on the 6th of June, and that he, in consequence of the absence of Mr. Ellis, wished to have the time enlarged to the 18th of July.
 Mr. Bernal  said, that Mr. Ellis had no authorised agent in this country.
 Mr. Bathurst  begged the House to consider that the object of the present motion was only to remove the consideration of the petition from the 6th of June to the 18th of July, a day on which another petition of a similar nature was to be taken into consideration; and it might happen, that the person complained of in that peti-
 604
 Sir R. Heron  said, he did not undertake to prove that Mr. Ellis was now in possession of the office, but that he did accept it.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he apprehended that official intelligence from the Cape would be sufficient to warrant the committee in coining to a decision on the question, but at the present moment it was quite impossible to have any intelligence of that kind. Me did not think it possible to move for a new writ, now that the case was  sub judice.
 Mr. Courtenay  admitted, that considering the office Mr. Ellis held as a notoriously new one, he was inclined to suppose him ineligible; but he had stated that there were many possible ways in which he might have become eligible.
 Mr. Macdonald  rose, not to oppose the motion, but to make a few remarks upon
 608 609
 Mr. Wilson  seconded the motion, and said, that it was necessary that a great manufacturing country should depend upon its exports, to enable it to indulge in the luxuries which were obtained from foreign countries. It appeared to be the general feeling of the House, that a more liberal system of commercial policy should be pursued, and in that feeling he was happy to find that the president of the
 617 s. d. s. d. d.
 Mr. Western  thought that the hon. member who spoke last had taken rather too much for granted. If he believed that the tax would prevent the manufacturer from going freely into foreign markets, he should concur with that hon. member in his disapprobation of it. It should not be forgotten, however, that one of the first effects of this duty had been to induce Spain to take off part of her export duty. It was a curious circumstance, that during a period of the most extensive exportation of coarse woollen manufactures, not more than half the quantity of foreign wool had found its way into this country, which came into it at present. In the year 1790, not more than 3,000,000 lbs. of wool had been imported.
 618
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that he continued in the same sentiments which he had expressed in the course of the last session, and agreed with the hon. gentleman, that whatever might be the ultimate effect of the measure, no sufficient experiment had yet been made to warrant the proposed alteration. If it was improper, generally speaking, to apply a tax to the raw material, it was a principle no less sound, that by the effect of taxation our natural produce should be supported. The noble lord had adverted in his speech to general principles, as regarded the present question, and if the ordinary rules of political economy could be dispensed with in one case they might be dispensed with in another. That noble lord had stated, that the present measure was sometimes called a measure of protection, and sometimes a measure of revenue; and he had declared, that whatever might be said in its defence upon the one ground, must necessarily operate against it upon the other. Now, he saw no such inconsistency. The article would be a fair article for the support of the revenue; if it could
 619 l. l. l. 620
 Mr. Curwen  said, he thought the woollen manufactures, above all others, demanded the peculiar protection of the House, and that a more impolitic tax than the present had never been proposed; for at the same time that it failed to assist the agriculturist, for whose benefit it was said to be laid on, it operated a direct and considerable injury to the manufacturer. Whatever tended to decrease productive labour must be injurious, and this measure was of that description; for it discouraged the woollen trade, which employed a larger proportion of people than any other. He wished that every labouring hand in the country should be productively employed; as many as possible in agriculture, and the remainder in commerce and manufactures.
 Mr. Philips  said, he must give the noble lord's motion his support, because he was of opinion that the tax was calculated to prevent exportation, and by no means adapted to relieve the distresses of the manufacturing classes.
 Mr. Barrett  opposed the motion. He did not see how this tax could have raised the price of wool, it being in operation only since October last.
 Mr. Bankes  said, as the trustees of the Museum had some time since purchased a very large library, which cost a considerable sum, they were determined, oh this occasion, to ask for such an aid as would not bear too hard on the public funds. With respect to placing the books in a more eligible situation, he was afraid it would require a large sum, because the
 627
 Mr. Littleton  bore testimony to the excellent conduct of the noble mover, throughout the whole of the investigations and discussions which had taken place upon this question. That conduct was, indeed, the subject of praise in every circle where he heard the question alluded to. He therefore hoped the noble lord would follow his own views upon the mea-
 611
 Mr. Tierney  said, that his reason for offering a word on this occasion was, that
 603
 Mr. Tierney  said, that many members did not know upon what grounds the hon. member moved.
 Mr. Bright  thought that some means should be devised to make a distinction, in the operation of the measure before the House, between the case of the honest unfortunate and that of the fraudulent debtor; for it was obviously unjust that the same measure of punishment should be inflicted alike upon all debtors before they could avail themselves of the proposed law. Some scale of imprisonment then, or some criterion of distinction, ought to be established. The cases of fraud and of suffering disclosed before the committee upon this subject forcibly called for such an arrangement. If an accusation of fraud were made by any one creditor, by the practice of the Insolvent Debtors court
 610
 Mr. Brougham  said, the House ought to hear all before they made up their minds on the present case. He would suppose this motion was never made; and if he had the same impression on his mind as the hon. gentleman opposite, he should hesitate before he would make such a motion, as the hon. gentleman seemed to be certain that the utmost delay would only tend to show that Mr. Ellis was ineligible. For his part, he thought a greater difficulty existed in point of fact than in point of law. He thought the person who proposed this measure was not a friend to Mr. Ellis. If the committee were ballotted for, and in the act of sitting, he would defy the petitioner to make out his case; and why? His hon. friend said it was an office created since 1795; yes, but it must be proved that Mr. Ellis was in possession of it on the day upon which he was elected. If any member moved for a new writ for a person to serve in the room of Mr. Ellis, it might turn out that some other person was entitled to take the seat. It appeared to him that it should be proved that Mr. Ellis actually held the office on the day of his return for Boston. He thought that could not be ascertained, except by the appearance of Mr. Ellis, or by sending out to the Cape. He did not see the possibility of proving the contents of the petition. The gentleman alluded to had left the Cape a month previous to the election; and he therefore could not say that Mr. Ellis held the office at the time of his return for Boston. It might happen, if a new writ were issued, that
 605
 Mr. Stuart Wortley  felt that both his noble friend and himself, as representatives of the county in which this great manufacture was principally carried on, would be listened to with some suspicion
 621 622
 Mr. Lambton  said, that he would not object to any set of men approaching that House in a constitutional way. At the same time he could not help expressing his extreme disgust at the hypocritical cant of the petitioners. That the circulation of Sunday newspapers was injurious to public morals, was a doctrine to which lie could not subscribe. He thought that wherever the press laboured to oppose the advances of slavery and corruption, the circulation of newspapers on any day was a moral as well as a constitutional act; but if those dealers and venders thought otherwise, if they felt those conscientious scruples, they might easily retire from a pursuit, which they considered immoral. He could not but condemn the language of the petition; he could not sit silent and hear so gross a charge brought against the Sunday newspapers. Where, he asked, was to be found an immoral of indecent, or seditious Sunday newspaper? He did not know of one. He thought, on the contrary, that the newspapers conveyed instruction, political as well as moral, to the people of England. He thought that the peti-
 601
 Mr. J. Smith  said, that in the present state of the country, he should be unwilling to vote for the repeal of any tax, unless it pressed heavily upon the people, and was peculiarly injurious to their interests. The reason for this unwillingness was the alarm he felt from the present financial state of the country. Any measure tending to lessen the means of supporting the public credit should be viewed with some degree of alarm. He did not, however, feel disposed to continue the wool tax, as he considered it liable to great objections. The cloth manufacture

 Mr. Colborne  said, that although the country had every reason to expect that a system of economy should, as much as possible, be adopted, still he would not, on an occasion of this kind, be too rigid in pursuing that system. He should be sorry that so important an establishment as the British Museum, which was indeed a national one, should be cramped for want of proper funds. He suggested the propriety of an easier and more general access to the library, which ought also to be put in better order than it was at present. Considerable public advantage had been derived from the readiness with which admission to the other parts of the Museum was allowed, and many individuals had greatly benefitted by it. He could not help regretting that the same liberality was not acted on with respect to other public buildings. He knew not why those who visited Westminster-abbey, St. Paul's, &c., should be obliged to pay for their admission.
 Mr. Huskisson  thought that the hon. gentleman who spoke last had mistaken the meaning of the chancellor of the exchequer as of the abolition of the Spanish export duty. It had merely been stated, that the tax being levied now in England, and not in Spain, went into the treasury of England, and not into the Spanish treasury. He believed it would scarcely be denied, that three-fourths of the foreign wool which was imported into this country was consumed by the population of this country; consequently, if the tax which had existed in Spain was now levied in England, that tax, as regarded the

 Mr. W. Smith  thought there never was an instance in which the trustees of any institution had more completely seconded the views of parliament than the trustees of the British Musuem had done. The improvements introduced by them, in the last 10 or 15 years, must strike every man who had visited the Museum before and since that time. He conceived it was discreditable to the country, that other public works were not equally open to inspection. Whosoever went to St. Paul's, at the present moment, must pay for admission, as if they visited an exhibition. The only point in which it differed from an exhibition was, that the public convenience was never once thought of by the persons who showed the place. They thought of nothing but the collection of a trifling tax from those who visited the
 628
 The Speaker  said, he thought the petition on the table must be disposed of before any member would be at liberty to move for a new writ. The next question was, how the petition could be withdrawn after recognizances had been entered into. By a clause in the 28th of Geo. 3rd, the House could not issue a writ unless the seat were vacated by death or some other cause, which must arise subsequently to the election; and by the 53rd of Geo. 3rd, it was lawful for the House to permit a petition to be withdrawn upon matter which might subsequently arise verified upon oath.
 Sir R. Wilson  observed, that the doors of St. Paul's were almost constantly closed. In fact, it was neither ventilated by the air, nor visited by the rays of the sun.
 Lord Althorp  thanked the hon. gentleman for the compliment which he had thought proper to bestow upon his labours; but he begged it to be understood that whatever he had been enabled to do was owing to the assistance of the very intelligent committee with which he had had the honour to co-operate. He indeed went into that committee comparatively unacquainted with the subject, but he found himself enlightened in the progress of the inquiry, both as to principles and details, by the information and judgment of his able colleagues. He agreed entirely with the hon. member for Bristol, that Crown debtors ought not to be exempted from the operation of the proposed law. But when he mentioned his wish upon the subject in the committee, he found the attorney-general's objections were such that he was afraid of pressing the proposition in that House, lest he should hazard the fate of the bill. With regard to the hon. member's suggestion to authorise the appointment of a jury in certain cases, it was to be recollected that a jury could not be impanelled without expense, and that the petitioners to the Insolvent Debtors' court were generally mere paupers, who had not the means of defraying any expense. Again, it might be apprehended, that if a judge of this court were allowed to call in the aid of a jury, he might feel too much disposed to throw the responsibility, in certain cases, from his own shoulders. Besides, it was to be remembered, that the court alluded to was appointed not so much to, try matters of fact as to decide upon cases or equity. On these grounds he found the objections to the impanelling of a jury in this court so very strong, that he could not persuade himself to make the proposition, notwithstanding his reverence for that noble institution the trial by jury. The appointment of three judges he had been induced to propose from a variety of reasons which to his mind were quite satisfactory, and among others from the experience of the commissioners in bankrupt cases, which cases were so very analogous to those usually brought under the consideration of the Insolvent Debtors' court. When, indeed, the advantages likely to result from the proposed appointments were taken into consideration, be could not

 Lord Althorp  proceeded to describe the principal provisions of the Insolvent Debtors' bill, the seond reading of which he was about to move. In consequence of what had passed with regard to this measure upon a former evening, he felt it necessary to preface his motion with a few observations. It was now universally admitted among candid and considerate men, that the imprisonment of a debtor should not be continued at the will of a creditor, in other words, that a creditor

 Lord Milton,  on rising to submit the motion of which he had given notice, said he felt the difficulty as well as the importance of the duty he had undertaken, from the particular relation in which he stood to the petitioners, and from the great interest which a large body of his constituents had at stake. He might, however, say, with truth, that he was not swayed by the opinion of his constituents, for, whatever had been their sentiments, he should have entertained the same opinions that he now held. Those opinions were not new or speculative, but were founded on principles that appeared to be as immutable as truth itself. It had invariably been our policy to import the raw material of our manufactures at as cheap a price as possible; for he would not admit, that in particular instances, such as in the importation of cotton wool or raw silk, a contrary principle had been acted on: and if, as in the case of cotton a different policy had been pursued, it was only where the particular article of trade could bear an increase of price. It was during the last session, that that principle had, for the first time, with respect to the importation of wool, been departed from; and here he would observe, that there was considerable difficulty in dealing with the question, on account of the different appearances which it assumed; it was a sort of Proteus that changed its face as arguments were addressed to it. He did not mean to say that it had been so stated in that House; but he had seen many persons to whom it had been represented as a measure intended for very different and very opposite purposes; for to some it had been represented as a duty imposed merely for the purpose of assisting the revenue, and to others as a protection to the agriculturists. Now, it was impossible that it could be viewed in both these lights. As a measure of revenue it must necessarily be ineffectual, because at the time this duty was laid on, a greater revenue was derived from the importation of wool than had since been produced. Those who supported the tax might say, that it had not yet had time to be productive;

 Mr. Coke  said, that representing as he did a great agricultural county, from which many petitions had been presented, complaining of distress, and differing, as he happened to do upon this occasion, from many persons whom he highly esteemed, he could not help expressing his regret that this question had been agitated, as he felt it an imperative duty to declare his disapproval of the motion. Every one who knew him must be aware that he was delighted with agriculture, in the practice of which he had spent nearly the whole of his life; and that he was peculiarly attached to those by whom its interest was

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the proposed grant was to repay monies already advanced by the company, in consequence of a proposition adopted by that House upon the recommendation of a committee, as well as upon the report of our admiral on the station. This, he hoped, would be the last year in which any proposition of this nature would be submitted to the House, and it would be satisfactory to the hon. gentleman to learn that all those British colonies or [settlements on the coast of Africa were immediately to be

 Mr. Robinson  expressed himself extremely sorry to be compelled to address the House on a subject of such importance, at a time when he was labouring under a degree of indisposition that he was apprehensive would prevent him from making his statement so clear as he wished to make it; and he felt that on that account he must request the idulgence of the House, should he not be so explicit as he could assure them it was his earnest desire to be. Among the various subjects to which the attention of parliament was from time to time directed, there never in his opinion was one which required to be treated with more reserve, and more caution, and he would add, with less frequency than the question which his hon. friend the member for Surrey had just brought under the consideration of the House. On all topics connected with the subsistence of the people, there necessarily prevailed so much apprehension, and he was by no means disposed to deny, so much prejudice, that at all times and in all countries, such topics had been considered as involving matters of peculiar delicacy. So much was he impressed with this opinion that he confessed he felt great regret that the present discussion had taken place. When, at the commencement of last year, an expectation appeared to be entertained that the attention of parliament would be called to the revision of the corn laws, he and his colleagues had felt it to be their duty to state unequivocally their decided conviction that it was not expedient to alter the existing law. In communicating that opinion he had endeavoured to be as explicit as possible, not merely because he thought it his duty to be so, but because he flattered himself that so unequivocal a declaration might lead to the result that

 Mr. Western  thought it was impossible the House could reject his hon. friend's motion. He had the honour to represent a county which was as capable of sustaining the existing pressure as any county in the kingdom, but which was nevertheless exhibiting a declining capital, and other circumstances indicative of much distress. The petitioners to the House did certainly expect some legislative measure more protecting than the act of 1815. For himself, he absolutely disclaimed any intention by legislative enactments to bolster up the value of corn, for the purpose of securing a remunerating price to the farmer. The object which he had always had in view, was to render this country independent of a foreign supply. For the expediency of that policy he had always contended. In 1815, he had maintained that the bill then passed was not sufficient. And so it had proved. The British farmer had not sufficient security and encouragement, or he would, fertilize every acre in the kingdom. In all our former corn laws, the price at which importation had been allowed was always greater than the average price in

 Mr. Baring  expressed the satisfaction with which he had heard the speech of I the right hon. the president of the board I of trade. Notwithstanding the want of temper which had been charged upon him on this occasion, he could assure the I House that he would view this question with as much calmness and temper as any member, even the hon. mover, who was so distinguished for coolness and patience, could possibly do. So convinced was he of the impolicy of bringing forward any question which could agitate the public mind, that he felt great reluctance to enter on the subject. He had opposed the Corn bill in the first instance, and he had since had no reason to change the opinions he had then stated. At the same time he was convinced of the general impolicy of disturbing the system on which a great country moved and acted, and which it was highly important that the inhabitants of that great country should think solid and permanent. This consideration had deterred him from saying any thing upon the subject from the passing of the bill to the present time, though it had confessedly turned out, as was predicted to be totally inadequate to give those whose interests it was meant to serve that protection they required; the result had also

 Mr. Frankand Lewis  agreed, that it was above all things desirable that the law should be made permanent on this subject. He wished for an extended inquiry with a view to some measure that should relieve the farmer from that state of feverish anxiety in which he was kept by a perpetual attention to average and importing prices. A refusal to inquire he did not think the best means of tranquillising the public mind. Some of the petitions prayed for a change in, the general policy of our system, not for immediate relief, under the pressure of difficulty and distress. They claimed only that sort of protection which bad been afforded, in an almost boundless measure, to every branch of our manufactures. They stated that it would be wise, just, and equitable, to extend the same principle to land; and upon their making out this proposition before a committee, they rested their title to the consideration of parliament. If their views and arguments were erroneous, it would be an easy matter to refute them. Unquestionably the same principles of encouragement which applied to manufactures did not apply to agriculture, because the former were susceptible of the highest degree of improvement, and the utmost degree of cheapness; but the latter, when extended, must, by being driven to inferior land, have its produce deteriorated in quality, and raised in price. Unfortunately no interests were more at variance than those of the owner and occupier of land. The landlord had but one object, that of obtaining the highest rent; but the tenant, whatever might be his interest under an existing lease, could derive no advantage from protecting prices when that lease expired. As a permanent system he must lose rather than gain by it, because whatever tended to raise the price of labour must diminish the profits of stock. The present system was evidently injurious to him; for, in the event of an excess or more than an average crop, he could not export to a foreign place, where there might happen to be a demand, till the price fell below the average, not of this country merely, but of that to which he exported. It operated, therefore, as a prohibition on the export
 662 s. 663 s. 664 665
 Lord Castlereagh  rose, not for the purpose of entering into any further discussion, but to call the attention of the House to the question which now stood before them. The member for Surrey had proposed to refer all the petitions to the consideration of a select committee, with a view of entering into the whole subject, and effecting a complete alteration of the scale of protection settled in 1815. Agreeing as he did with his right hon. friend the president of the board of trade, and with his right hon. friend on his left, it was immaterial, in his view, whether the proposition of the member for Surrey were got rid of by a direct negative, or by the previous question. Either of these courses would equally effect his object of not going into a general view of the agricultural state of the country. At the same time he did not wish to preclude any other hon. member from adopting the suggestion of his right hon. friend, the president of the board of trade: he was ready to give his support to a motion for a committee, not to enter into so large a field of inquiry as would tend to alter the scale of protection adopted in 1815, but to inquire whether, by fraud or evasion in the mode of striking the averages, the provisions of the Corn bill had been defeated. The suggestion of the hon. and learned gentleman would open the whole question of the scale of protection, and if the averages were taken upon a survey of the whole surface of the united kingdom, an alteration of 6 s. s.
 Mr. Alderman Heygate  thought that the Corn laws required to be reconsidered, agriculture having been much affected by the bullion question. He would, however, oppose any rise in the average price of corn, or any tax on capital in trade, which was equally depressed with agriculture, and in his opinion from the same cause.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald,  as a member from Ireland, wished to say a few words in favour of the agricultural interests of a country which appeared to be neglected. He thought that the distresses of the people merited the serious attention of the House.
 Mr. Having  expressed his apprehension that the decision of the House that night would tend to show the people the perilous state they were in, and produce the greatest dissatisfaction. The House having come to this unexpected, and, in his mind, lamentable decision, he thought a fitter time than the present should be appointed for choosing the members of a committee upon which so much would depend. He therefore proposed that the further consideration of the subject should be adjourned till to-morrow. He trusted the decision of that night would convince those whose opinions agreed with his own of the necessity of watching this proceeding strictly; and, for his own part, he pledged himself to oppose it in every stage.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he had intended himself to make the motion which the hon. gentleman had just made. He deplored and lamented from the bottom of his heart the decision of the House. So-little had he anticipated such a result, that, being asked by several persons whether he thought there was such a difference of opinion as would make it necessary for them to remain in the House till-the division, he had told them that nothing was so unlikely, from the temper which the House had evinced during the debate, as an effective support of the motion. If he had thought that it would have had so many supporters, there would have been a very different attendance of members, and a very different result.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that when the hon. gentleman showed him his list, he compared it with the list which his right hon. friend had prepared, with the view of adopting the measure for a limited inquiry, thinking that only such an inquiry would be granted, he had paid little attention to the list.
 Mr. Gordon  expressed himself satisfied with the explanation of the right hon. gentleman, but declared his wish to have the report of our admiral on the station laid before the House.
 Mr. Gordon  expressed a hope that the prayer of this petition would not be acceded to until the establishments of the company from whom it proceeded should be inquired into by the House. These establishments were professedly instituted, in the first instance, with a view to the civilization of the inhabitants of Africa; but it was known that they were become mere commercial speculations, in which the interest of each of the speculators was much more consulted than the civilization of the negro. These institutions were, besides, not at all under the control of the British government; and under these circumstances, they formed an anomaly which called for investigation, before any of the public money was voted for their use.
 Mr. Ricardo  said, that there was one sentiment delivered by an hon. gentleman in the early part of the debate, in which he cordially concurred, namely, that in legislative enactments, the interest of one body of men ought not to be consulted at the expense of others, but that each should receive corresponding consideration in proportion to its importance. He (Mr. Ricardo) would wish to act up to this maxim, and, because he consulted the interests of the whole community, he would oppose the corn-laws. In many of the observations which he intended to make he had been anticipated by his hon. friend the member for Taunton. The agriculturists had contended that they had a right to be protected in a remunerating price for their produce, but they forget that no remunerating price could be fixed. It was in vain to talk of fixing a remunerating price, which must necessarily change with circumstances. If by preventing importation the farmer was compelled, for the national supply, to expend his capital on poor or unprofitable soils, the remunerating price at which he could keep this land in cultivation must be very high, as compared with the price of grain in other countries, where the soil was better, and less labour was required. Open the ports, admit foreign grain, and you drive this land out of cultivation; a less remunerating price would then do for the more productive lands. You might thus have fifty remunerating prices according as your capital was employed on productive or unproductive lands. It became the legislature, however, not to look at the partial losses which would be endured by a few, who could not cultivate their land profitably, at a diminished remunerative price, but to the general interests of the nation; and, connected with this, he would look to the profits of capital. In his opinion a remunerating price might have been so fixed, that 50 s. 672 s. 673 l., 674 675 s. 676
 Mr. Ellice  asked the hon. mover whether he meant to press his motion to a division? He put this question because he understood that some compromise was proposed to the hon. gentleman; and if he did not mean to agree to that proposition he (Mr. E.) should feel it his duty to move the previous question, as it was now evidently the object of those who supported the motion before the House to produce an aggravation of the evils under which the country laboured, in consequence of the system of the corn laws.
 Mr. Ellice  then moved the previous question.
 Mr. Ellice  said, the reason why he moved the previous question was, that a member who had followed the hon. mover, had, as he thought, laid before the House a motion not consistent with the views of the hon. member for Surrey. He therefore proposed the previous question; but he was far from wishing that the prayers of a suffering people should not be attended to. He would therefore, with the permission of the House, withdraw the motion for the previous question.
 Mr. Gipps  said, he held in his hand an amendment, which was to the effect, that a select committee be appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the mode best fitted for ascertaining the average price of corn. He should think it his duty to put this, unless the hon. member withdrew his motion for the previous question.
 Mr. Sumner  said, that the decision of the House had taken him as much by surprise as it seemed to have taken others; for, however convinced he was of the propriety of the measure be proposed, he had not thought that any proposal he could make to the House would have been so favourably received. As to the nomination of the committee, he had before the division communicated, with the noble lord, and they had showed each other their committees, in which there was only a difference of three names.
 Mr. Sumner  observed, that he could not see that any good result would be produced by any such compromise as the hon. gentleman had alluded to.
 Mr. Holme Sumner,  in rising to introduce to the consideration of the House the agricultural distresses of the country, regretted that the subject had not been brought forward by some gentleman more intimately acquainted with its details, and more frequently in the habit of addressing the House. He regretted more particularly that his hon. friend the member for Essex, whose great knowledge upon all questions connected with the agriculture of the country was universally acknowledged, had been prevented by the state of his health from bringing forward this motion, for he was sure it would have been matter of infinite satisfaction to the House, if that gentleman had been able to take the lead on this occasion. It was most necessary, however, that the subject should be brought forward, and he felt persuaded that the agriculture of the country was so rapidly advancing to a state of decay, that unless some measures were taken to stop the total exhaustion of capital embarked in it, ruin of an irretrievable character must fall upon that class of the community who were connected with it. He could not but regret that whenever the agriculturists approached that House to complain of grievances, or petition for relief, the members of the House connected with the manufacturing and commercial interests seemed to think that the gauntlet was thrown down, and that it was necessary to meet any measure which might be proposed for the relief of the agriculturists with the most active opposition. The agricultural petitioners did not come before the House to attack the mercantile or manufacturing interests. He felt that the interests of these three classes were intimately and inseparably connected, and that one of them could not fall into a state of decay without entailing the inevitable ruin of the other. The agriculturists did not come forward to encroach upon the commercial or manufacturing interests, but to claim that protection which the legislature had al-

 Mr. Brougham  apologised to the House for rising at that late hour, but he could not, consistently with the duty which he owed his country—consistently with the respect due to the agricultural interest, and to the numerous body of persons whose petitions crowded from every quarter, and covered the table of the House, give a silent vote on the present motion, after hearing the very extraordinary motion of the previous question made by the hon. member for Coventry. He could conceive the reasons why some gentlemen, after gravely weighing the question, and yielding to the subtleties of the hon. member for Portarlington, or to the ingenuity of the hon. member for Taunton, should determine to meet it on its merits, and to decide manfully upon it; but of all the ways which he could possibly imagine of getting rid of the question, he should least think of that proposed by the hon. mem-
 684 685 l. l., 686 687 s. s. 688 689 s.;
 Mr. Brougham  lamented the necessity of differing from his gallant friend on any subject, but more especially on a subject so delicate as the present. He did not say it was so in itself, but the hon. gentlemen made it delicate by the manner in which they treated it. He would ask if any thing had fallen from the hon. mover, or from any of those who had supported his motion, that could warrant the belief that they wished to introduce a new system of corn laws? for it had been held out to every man in England, Scotland, and Ireland, that the object of this committee was, to raise the price of bread. He himself had said over and over again, till he had nauseated the House with the repetition of the argument, that he was, in the first instance, for granting no farther assistance to the agriculturists than they had been formerly acknowledged by the legislature to be entitled to.
 General Gascoyne  said, that there was scarcely a member present who" was not aware, before he entered the House that evening, that he intended to move the previous question. So strongly was he opposed to the appointment of a committee for the purposes intended by the hon. mover, that if such committee should be appointed, and any measure be carried upon its recommendation, he should feel himself bound to make an attempt to repeal that measure, or at least to bring the subject again under the consideration of the House. After this explanation, the House would not be surprised at his objecting to the motion for the previous question being withdrawn.
 Mr. Benett,  of Wiltshire, said the hon. member who had preceded him, had told the House that this country would arrive at a degree of prosperity almost beyond imagination if it could get rid of the National Debt, and the Corn laws. By putting the National Debt first, the hon. member had seemed to admit that it was necessary to get rid of the National Debt before the Corn law could be put an end to. He (Mr. Benett) should not detain the House by entering into any discussion of political economy, because he presumed every member was acquainted with the principles of Adam Smith, which continued the foundation of all political economy to the present day. If we had no National Debt we should certainly want no Corn laws, but while we had debt and taxes, we could not manufacture corn as cheaply as those who were not similarly burthened. They were told that this was not the time to agitate the question of the Corn laws. Every time was, in his opinion, fit to agitate the causes of the national distress, and to perform an important duty to the country, unbiassed by the clamour of any class of the people. He did not advocate, however, the present Corn law, which had thrown odium on the agriculturist, without affording him protection, and he should wish it to be repealed, parliament granting some more efficient protection. The mode of taking the averages was bad; the law left an opening for bribery (that

 Mr. Mansfield  maintained, that the object of the motion was, to raise the present protecting duties on corn. Agreeing with the hon. member for Coventry, he should very cordially second the motion for the previous question. Being the representative of a place of large manufactures, he felt it his duty to state, that however great the distress of the agriculturists, the distress of the manufacturers was much greater. He regretted that the hon. member had not also moved for a committee to take the situation of the manufacturers into consideration, for he would then have given him his entire support.

 Lord Milton  lamented the decision the House had come to, and entreated them to defer the nomination of the committee on account of the lateness of the hour.
 Mr. Bennet  bore testimony to the severe suffering of many persons confined for contempt of the court of Chancery. He had known instances in which the parties had, after long imprisonment, endeavoured to purge themselves from contempt, but had no means of doing so, the parties being all dead, and the cause quite forgotten. The best mode of preventing this unjust suffering, would be that the noble lord at the head of the court, should bring all the cases under his review once or twice every year.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that it was usual, when any bargain had been concluded between the Treasury and the monied interest, that he should take the earliest opportunity of stating the terms of it to the House. He therefore wished it to be suffered that the committee of ways and means should have precedence, that he might now state the terms of a bargain which he had concluded.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, it was necessary for him to explain the reason why he had thus suddenly, without previous notice, risen to state the terms of the bargain which he had concluded on the part of the public. He had allowed three days for the operation of funding exchequer bills under the terms of his offer; and he thought he should have been enabled, before the conclusion of it, to give notice that he should state the terms of his bargain on Friday. But the whole business for which he had allowed three days had been transacted in half an hour; and as it was the invariable practice to take the earliest opportunity of stating the terms of such bargains, he had preferred doing so without notice, to the delay which a notice would have Occasioned. He did so with the more satisfaction, because he could recommend the bargain as one evidently advantageous to the public. It differed in one circumstance, indeed, from any similar bargain which the public had ever concluded, viz. in this—that the stock to be created was less than the actual sum of capital debt to be extinguished. He had a few days ago issued a notice, that a subscription would be opened for funding seven millions of exchequer bills. Oil the 1st of January the outstanding Exchequer bills had amounted to 35 or 36 millions, and four millions of Irish Treasury bills, making 39 millions of unfunded debt, which was ten millions less than the unfunded debt at the same period last year. Of those 39 millions, about 14; millions in Exchequer bills were in the hands of the Bank of England, and all the Irish Treasury bills were in the hands of the Bank of England and the Bank of

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that with respect to the first point to which the hon. gentleman had spoken, there would have been much complaint it previous notice had not been given for some time. The right hon gentleman then spoke of a different mode of managing the business, which would ensure perfect quiet and prevent any crush, by omitting a long previous notice, and thereby preventing a fair competition; but that plan would not have answered. He hoped, however, nothing of the kind alluded to would again occur. It was certainly desirable to obviate any crush or personal inconvenience. With respect to the second point, and the most important, he conceived that the hon. gentleman had not understood him. He had distinctly stated that the unfunded debt on the 5th of January last was 39,000,000 l. l. l. l.
 Mr. Maberly  bad no intention of making any comments upon the bargain which had taken place that morning, but could not help observing that he did not understand the statement made by the right hon. gentleman, that the whole amount of the unfunded debt on the 5th of January, 1820, did not exceed 39,000,000 l. 697 l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. 698
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  asserted, that no preference had been shown to any individuals, and argued, that the long notice which had been given of the terms of this loan was a proof that no partiality had been exercised in any quarter. Since Friday last, every man in London knew how this loan was to be effected; and the conducting of the preparatory steps to it had been intrusted to the Bank directors, whose upright and impartial conduct upon all occasions nobody would dispute. He then proceeded to state, that he had no doubt but that the hon. gentleman would perceive that the transaction of transferring the supplies for the service of the year 1819, to the service of' the year 1820 could give no assistance to the general finances of the year, inasmuch as it could give the government no power to create fresh exchequer-bills. A reduction of 10 or 11 millions of exchequer-bills, from 39 to 28 millions and a half, had certainly been made; and if the hon. gentleman looked again into the papers presented to the House, he would find the statement which he had made to be perfectly correct.
 Mr. Maberly  said, that he supposed the chancellor of the exchequer had declined to give an answer to his question, because it had not been worded with all the nicety and exactness of a special pleader. He was no lawyer, but still he would endeavour to put his question for once with special pleading accuracy. He therefore

 Mr. Peirce  vindicated the conduct of the Bank, and its agent, with regard to the transaction of this morning.
 Mr. Maberly  repeated his question respecting the amount of exchequer bills remaining unsold in January last; stating his intention, if not distinctly answered, to bring forward a distinct motion upon the subject.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the exchequer bills voted in 1819, were issued to replace those of 1818; so that this issue formed no addition whatever to the unfunded debt.
 Mr. Maberly  asked, why did not the right hon. gentleman give a plain answer to a plain question, as to the amount, of the exchequer bills unsold in January last, whether issued to replace those of IS 18 or not? The right hon. gentleman's mode of answering was indeed complete special pleading.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  declared, that the only answer which he could give to the hon. member's question, whether it was special pleading or not, was simply this, that it was not in his power distinctly to answer it, because be did not recollect the precise amount of the bills alluded to.
 Mr. Baring  asked when it was intended by the Bank to issue the new notes which had been so long looked for, or whether the sort of note to be manufactured was yet determined upon?
 Mr. Courtenay,  as one of the committee upon this subject stated, that the machinery for executing the notes alluded to, was constructed in the Bank, and that every practicable expedition was using to prepare the notes. He added that there was now no uncertainty whatever with respect to the sort of note to be issued.
 Mr. Peirce  said, that some of the new notes would be struck off in a few days, but as a great quantity must obviously be manufactured before any were issued, it was impossible to say at what time their issue would commence.
 Mr. Baring  did not at all doubt the diligence of the Bank upon this subject, but he could not see the propriety of the delay contemplated before any of the new notes were issued, as it did not appear to his mind necessary to provide at once for the exchange of all the old notes.
 Mr. Grenfell  perfectly agreed with his hon. friend as to the necessity of keeping up the consolidated fund, and not suffering it to go into arrears of seven millions and a half annually, to cover deficiencies of loans and exchequer bills. He thought there was something extremely unintelligible in the plans of the right hon. gentleman. All he understood of those plans in effect, was, that each quarter there were certain sums advanced by the bank, for which they were allowed to take possession of the growing produce of the revenue.
 Mr. Bennet  said, there was no law by which a man could be compelled to work even after sentence, unless for certain crimes, or when that sentence was expressly awarded. Then, as to wearing gaol liveries, every one knew the main object of wearing such clothes was, to prevent disguise, and therefore to narrow the facilities for escape. But for this there was also no law. What would any gentleman committed on a criminal charge think of being obliged before trial to wear a felon's dress? And no one could say when it might be his case—in a case of duelling for example. But such might be the case if they were confined in certain gaols throughout the country, He
 703
 Dr. Lushington  considered the statement of the noble lord to be an aggravation rather than an extenuation of the wrongs complained of by the petitioner; and he further considered the magistrates who had issued such an order as that under which he was rendered liable to their infliction, as principal parties included in the charge. So much had the question of imprisonment been discussed within the House, that he was astonished the magistrates had taken so much upon them. He might be excused if, on this subject, he expressed himself with some little warmth; but he asked his noble friend what justification he set up for the conduct pursued towards the petitioner? Why, forsooth, the petitioner had refused to wear the livery of the gaol, and the order under which the gaoler acted gave him a power of punishing the offender, and why?—"for setting a bad example." Well, and was the petitioner guilty of any offence? No. He was as yet untried, when he was forced to hard labour, and to the wearing of a gaol livery; he was in that situation in which the law pronounces every man to be innocent. But such were the circumstances under which not only the petitioner, but every other person committed to the gaol of Lancaster might be subject to such arbitrary indignities. When parties were found guilty of a crime of magnitude, it might be proper to oblige them to labour; but when they considered that for an imputed crime, any hon. member might be sent to gaol, ought they not to look to the manner in which magistrates exercised the almost boundless power which was vested in them Did any man in the present day mean to say, that he might not be committed to a gaol where such orders were enforced, and be committed for no offence whatsoever? Let them look at the discretion vested in the gaoler, so powerful an officer in the present day, and they would find how much was committed to him. Either before or after trial he could enforce hard labour and the gaol livery on any prisoner. After what he had said, he wished to guard himself against the possibility of that misrepresentation. He wished generally that the prisoners should

 Lord Folkestone  said, that general testimony respecting the character of an individual could not prevail over the evidence of particular facts. He hoped the petition would be printed, not solely on account of the treatment which the petitioner had suffered while in confinement, but because he had been committed by the magistrates, and detained in prison for two months, on a charge of high treason, after which notice had been given to him, that he was to be tried for a misdemeanor only. His prison dress had then been changed, and he had been put into a different yard. But the object to which he wished particularly to advert was, the wish
 705
 The Attorney General  was astonished to hear the noble lord make such an assertion as that magistrates or justices of the peace had not the power to commit for high treason, because, on former occasions, he had heard the noble lord, in discussing questions connected with the laws of the country, evince a degree of legal knowledge which he should have thought would have prevented him from falling into such a mistake. The learned gentleman said it was distinctly laid down in Bum's Justice that a magistrate had the power of committing for high treason.
 Lord Folkestone  would not dispute on legal points with the learned gentleman, but he had thought it was explicitly declared in the book to which the learned gentleman had referred, that a magistrate or justice could not commit for high treason, and that felony was the highest crime within the commission of the peace.
 Mr. Baring  rose, and observed, that he could not allow even the reading of the names to be concluded without expressing his decided opinion that a committee so formed could not leave a moment's doubt
 706
 Mr. Calcraft  said, that when he had voted against the appointment of a committee, he was aware that a certain degree of distress prevailed among the agriculturists, but he could not conscientiously consent to inquiry, when he heard its advocates talk of nothing but relieving the country at large by increasing the price of corn. He had, in fact, refused it entirely on this ground. When, too, the hon. member for Surrey, by gaining a majority, had become, as it were, in his own person the government of the country, and had taken upon himself to name his own committee for his own purposes, he took it for granted that he would appoint such gentlemen as were favourable to his views: on that very ground he had felt alarm, and on that ground he thought that alarm would be felt throughout the country. As to the distress of the agriculturists, though he was convinced that it existed, he was convinced also that it had been extremely exaggerated. He had gone through various parts of the country, and he had had intercourse with gentlemen largely concerned; and from all he could see and hear he was satisfied that this extreme agricultural distress was never heard of but within the walls of the House [Hear, hear!]. He used the words "extreme distress" purposely, for he remembered that the hon. member for Essex (Mr. Western) four or rive years ago, had made an admirable speech upon the subject, had given details from different parts of the country, had dwelt upon the number of farms that were unlet, upon the executions in the houses of broken agriculturists, and of the amount of rent remaining in arrear; but where were such statements to be found, on the present occasion? He must say, that he had never heard a case more partially stated; nothing but corn was talked of, though he should like to know whether the stock-farmer had not been prosperous: if the grower of grain had been unfortunate, what was the state of the breeder of cattle; and had he been an equal sufferer? He would only add, that, though he would not turn a deaf ear to the number of respectable petitioners who presented themselves, yet he thought it was matter of alarm to the nation that such a vote had been passed as that of last night.
 Mr. Bankes  objected to wandering from the simple point at issue, and expressed his approval of the nomination of Mr. C Dundas.
 Mr. Maxwell  said:—It would be unfair to the hon. mover, if I did not state that one of the members of the manufacturing counties was nominated in his committee, before I requested that my name might be erased. Feeling, as I do, that no method is fair, just, or efficacious, but that obtained by a protecting duty, I thought myself unfit to be a member of a committee, whose avowed object was, to adhere to the principle of prohibition. No wish to avoid the unpopularity which it might have given me, would have had the smallest influence in leading me to this resolution, because I am confident, that the petitions of the agricultural classes particularly demand our consideration and our regard, these constituting the great market for manu-
 711 712
 Mr. Baring,  in explanation, said, he wished to avoid giving any unnecessary alarm; but the great evil was, that the alarm might, as in this case, be so well founded, as to show that the thing which created it was prejudicial to the best interests of the country.
 Mr. Robinson,  without renewing the discussion which had taken place upon the preceding evening, would simply explain to the House why he now took a course which he had not then adopted. He objected to the principle upon which the motion of the hon. member for Surrey had been brought forward. Those particular circumstances as to which, in his opinion, inquiry might have been beneficial, did not, he thought, afford ground for the appointment of a committee; and therefore, although he should not have objected to an amendment, he did not propose one. An hon. friend of his had proposed an amendment, and the House had only been prevented from coming to a decision upon it by a point of form: it appeared that the hon. member who moved the previous question could not withdraw it without the unanimous consent of the House. He thought it his duty, however, since the House had determined that inquiry should take place, to limit that inquiry within the narrowest possible bounds; at least, within those bounds which he believed could alone lead to any practical advantage. The right hon. member then moved, "That it be an instruction to the said committee, to confine their inquiry to the mode of ascertaining, returning, and calculating the average prices of corn in the twelve
 715
 Mr. Wodehouse  did not last night wish to obtrude himself on the House. He was most anxious, however, that measures should be taken to suppress that dreadful system of gambling to which the corn trade at present was so peculiarly liable. Serious disadvantage resulted from the difficulty which existed in getting fair returns of the inferior sorts of corn. His right hon. friend, the president of the board of trade, thought that much of this inconvenience might be remedied by the interference of magistrates; but he (Mr. Wodehouse) was persuaded that magistrates would, in such a situation, be exposed to considerable difficulties. He knew of no act giving magistrates a controlling power in this respect, except the 31st of king George 3rd. This gave the magistrates an opportunity of checking the average, if the inspector were incorrect by the official corn returns; but that was insufficient. An hon. gentleman who sat near him felt somewhat incredulous as to the frauds committed in the corn trade; and he had himself, at one time, been nearly as incredulous as that hon. gentleman; for, though he certainly believed that frauds were practised, yet he had, as certainly, no conception of their importance, and of their extent. He was far from intending to raise a hue and cry against any trade; but he had received information from a quarter which he could not doubt, although he was unwilling to disclose it, of a fraud which had been committed, doubtless unintentionally, by one of the very first houses in Hamburgh. One of the principal dealers at Hamburgh had shipped a considerable quantity of wheat to this country, of a very superior quality. From the peculiar quality of this grain, the shipper was desirous to see it after it was warehoused; but, on inquiring at the warehouse, he was told that he could not see it; it was gone. He (Mr. Wodehouse) did not know that his credulity might not have been imposed upon; but it was important that the public mind should be set at rest. There was considerable difficulty in procuring, under the existing regulations, correct returns of the quantity of corn grown in large districts. To show the uncertainty of any average prices, founded upon the general returns, he would mention a

 Mr. Stuart Worthy  admitted, that indeed it was high time to speak out when such doctrines as the House had just heard were gravely laid down. He then, for one, must fairly say, that the country was not at this moment in a situation to bear a higher price of corn. He admitted, with the supporters of this motion, that the agriculturists were entitled to every protection which could be consistently extended to them; but he was convinced, that of all classes they were suffering the least, and that their distress bore no pro-
 717
 Mr. Benelt,  of Wiltshire, denied that he had ever been an advocate for high prices, and said he looked on the appointment of the committee as one step to their permanent reduction. Could it be supposed, that if the whole land were thrown out of cultivation, and we depended on foreign supplies alone, that the price of corn would be low in this country? Surety not; and whatever therefore tended to the protection of our agriculture, and to preserve us from foreign dependence, must have a tendency to avert the evil of high and fluctuating prices. It had been shown, in Mr. Colquhoun's book, that, in those years when we were under the necessity of importing corn in the greatest quantities, we never received a supply from abroad more than sufficient for 39 days consumption in the year. A good deal had been said with regard to the high price of cattle during the last year; but the fact was, that about four years ago that pi ice was so low as very materially to check the propagation, and the present rise was but a reaction from the scarcity so produced. The great mischief of the corn laws, as now framed, was, that they kept alive a constant anxiety in the minds both of the farmers and merchants. He had not the honour of a seat in the House when the measure of 1815 was adopted, or he should have stated this objection, for at that time he clearly foresaw the evil to which he was adverting. He wished to see another system substituted, and a direct duty imposed on foreign corn, equivalent to the superior taxation which we had to support. It had been truly said by a great authority on subjects of political economy, that, were it not for our immense debt and taxation, no protection would be wanted; the land, as well as the manufactures, would then be able to maintain itself; but
 718
 Mr. Baring  was free to declare it to be his opinion, that if the House evinced any disposition to follow the course indicated by the gentleman who had moved and supported the motion, there would be ample ground for alarm, and he, for one, would be ready to pull the tocsin with all his might. If the House was determined to take such measures, the country could not take the alarm too generally nor too immediately. He trusted that he should not be misunderstood, and that no one would suppose that he could wish to favour the promotion of irritation, or hold that such measures ought to be opposed by tumult or commotion. Gentlemen who were members of that House at the time when the last Corn bill was passed, might remember that it was, at last, owing to such commotions that the bill was carried—[No, no!]. Certainty, whatever might be the opinion of gentlemen, the opposition of the House to that measure had rather been weakened than strengthened by the popular clamour. He was, however, of opinion, that if the House did propose to take the course to which he had alluded, the country could not too soon feel that alarm which should induce them to oppose it by constitutional measures. To use the language of one of the greatest and most eloquent men who ever sat in that House, "the alarm-bell at midnight, which disturbs our rest, may perhaps prevent us from being burnt in our beds."
 Mr. Bankes  apprehended, that the hon. gentleman who spoke last had assumedtoo much when he stated to the Housethat there was but one remedy for the distress under which the agriculturists laboured. He (Mr. Bankes) approached the subject with great hesitation and doubt, but not without hope that some benefit might result from inquiry—that some relief to the agricultural interest might be found practicable, without injury to any other. Unquestionably that interest was intimately blended with the commercial and manufacturing, and the last twenty years had furnished various examples that the difficulties of one were sure to extend themselves to all. As to what had been said with regard to this being a time for speaking out, he feared that more indiscretion than sound sense had been manifested

 Lord Castlereagh  said, he was anxious to rise after his hon. friend. His hon. friend, by taking the narrow ground, had

 Mr. Robinson  said, that of all the extraordinary instances of forgetfulness that he had ever witnessed was that displayed in the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman. He appealed to the House whether the hon. and learned gentleman had not expressed his regret last night that the forms of the House did not allow an amendment to be put, which was the same as the motion which he (.Mr. R.) had that night proposed. The amendment had been read by his hon. colleague, the member for Ripon, in the very terms in which the motion was now put, and it was stated distinctly by the hon. and learned gentleman, that he lamented that the motion of the hon. member for Coventry precluded that amendment from being put [No, no! from Mr. Brougham]. What then was it that the hon. and learned gentleman did regret? It was plain he wished the motion to be narrowed in some way; but if he thought fit to narrow it, were other members to be bound to do so precisely in the same manner as the hon. gentleman? With what fairness could the hon. and learned gentleman apply the word trick, for that, no doubt, was the word hinted at, to any such proposition? He hoped he should be incapable of any such miserable trick, as to attempt, by any indirect means, to get rid of what the House had decided upon.
 Mr. C. Dundas  declared, that if he did not consider that the interests of the agriculturist and the interests of the manufacturer were inseparable, he would not consent to act as a member of the committee.
 Mr. Bootle Wilbraham  said, that of the existence of this order he had been perfectly ignorant till the present moment. From its date it appeared to have been made in the year 1800; and he had no hesitation in saying that he disapproved of it. At the same time there could not be a stronger proof that it had not been much acted on, than the circumstance of this being the first time that it had been complained of, or that the House had heard of its existence.
 Mr. Ellice  observed that if he understood the remarks of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, his object

 Lord Stanley  said, he did not rise to offer any opposition to the motion for laying the petition on the table, but to defend the character of the person who had the charge of the castle of Lancaster. The noble lord proceeded to remark on the humanity of that individual, and read a copy of an order issued by the magistrates of the county, by which a discretionary power was given to the gaoler of imposing solitary confinement, and other restrictions, on those prisoners who refused to work, or to comply with the other regulations of the prison.
 Mr. Gipps  said, that the amendment which he had last night moved, was, at the beginning, in words the same as the motion made by the president of the board of trade that evening; in the latter part the motion was more limited than his amendment had been. The support of the hon. and learned gentleman had encouraged him to offer his amendment,
 741
 Mr. Sumner  said, the noble lord had accused him of imprudence, because he brought forward this motion, when the times were in so ticklish a state, and the public mind was likely to be agitated by it. The noble lord appeared, however, to have forgotten the disturbed state of the agricultural mind, although he had considered the feelings by which all other parties were agitated. It was that agitation of mind which caused such a number of petitions to be laid on their table—petitions from that class of people who formed the great source of our wealth, and who were, therefore, the first in importance. He did not mean to speak invidiously of the other classes. He looked on agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, to be the first pillars of the state. But, considering agriculture as the

 Mr. Sumner  declared, that in the expression that he had secured a majority in

 Mr. Sumner,  adverting to the wish expressed by that hon. gentleman to be excused from the committee, observed, that he had not the honour of knowing him, but that he had named him because he understood he was a man of talents, and because he was a member for Bristol. On the same principle he had nominated Mr. Canning and the Lord Mayor. He repeated his explanation, that in using the word "majority," he had merely meant a majority of persons disposed to inquire into the subject.
 Mr. Sumner  complained that he had not been quite fairly dealt with. The hon. member had desired time last night for the choice of the names to which he intimated that he should not object, under these circumstances an objection from him came rather ungraciously. Besides he had no right whatever to stigmatise the supporters of the inquiry, and to hold them up to the country as a source of alarm. He believed the members he had selected; for the committee were as fair and honourable men as could be chosen, and were as little calculated to excite public alarm as the hon. gentleman himself. He could only say, that it was impossible for him to know with any precision the sentiments of others; but as far, as he had been able to arrive at any degree of certainty upon the subject, he could assert that he had only done what it would have been absolutely foolish in him not to have done in the situation in which he stood; that is, he had procured for himself a fair majority [a laugh]. Was it to be supposed that he should propose a committee with a majority against himself?
 707
 Mr. Tierney  stated, that as he intended to vote for the proposition of the right hon. gentleman, and as his learned friend had imputed to that right hon. gentleman an attempt to play off a trick on the House, he was anxious to exculpate himself from being party to any trick, or from voting for the proposition on any such grounds. He could not but consider the debate of tonight as a continuation of that of the night before, and that the proposition now made had only not been made on the preceding evening, because the debate had been prolonged to too late an hour. He indeed understood the question of adjournment to be moved entirely with a view of giving an opportunity for the introduction of this proposition, which the forms of the House had then excluded from discussion. He was ready to admit, that if this proposition had been deferred until after the committee had sat some time, it would be open to the objections which had been made to it by his learned friend; but having been brought forward as a part of the preceding debate, as the condition under which the committee had been acceded to, he saw nothing in the course now pursued that was not consistent with the usual and fair parliamentary practice. With respect to the interests of the agriculturists, he could only say, that he had never heard of that degree of distress which had been pleaded in their behalf—that he had not heard of rents unpaid, or executions, or other symptoms of distress in an aggravated degree, nor did he believe them to exist. His great motive,

 Mr. Bright,  in explanation, said, he waved his objection to serve on the committee.
 Mr. Bright  observed, that he found his name among those whom it was proposed to appoint on the committee. If it were imperative on him to attend, he would certainly do so; but after the declaration of the hon. member for Surrey, that he had secured a majority, if be could by any possibility decline being on the committee he would; and he therefore put it to the courtesy of the hon. gentleman to excuse him. It appeared to him that the hon. gentleman had let out the whole mystery of appointing committees; and, as a young member, he had received a lesson that night which he should not readily forget.
 Mr. Brougham  explained, that he had last night copied what he understood to be the substance of the amendment of the hon. member for Ripon (Mr. Gipps), and had given it to the hon. member for Sussex, to whom he appealed, whether such had not been his understanding at the time.
 Mr. Brougham  saw some little inconsistency in the feeling of the hon. member, who, while he deprecated alarm as one of the worst effects likely to be produced by the appointment of the committee, proposed to be the first who should pull,
 714
 Mr. Brougham  observed, that he was unwilling to intrude himself on the patience and attention of the House, when he knew that the natural desire of gentlemen was, to conclude this discussion as soon as possible. After having stated his opinion perhaps at too great length on the preceding night, on the general merits of this question, it would not be necessary for him to enter minutely into the subject on this occasion. But they were now placed in a most peculiar situation, in consequence of the conduct adopted by his majesty's ministers, and he was bound to state the grounds on which his vote should be given. He felt almost precluded from entering into the merits of the question, even if he had more to answer than was advanced this night, for how did they find themselves placed with regard to those proceedings? A notice was solemnly given—a proper length of time was allowed to elapse—an opportunity was afforded by the hon. mover, for all gentlemen to consider the subject so that they might speak their sentiments deliberately and fully. He brought forward his proposition, and, after a debate—by no means a short one, and not confined to one branch of the question, but in the course of which every branch connected with it was presented to the House—at the mature hour of between three and four in the morning the House felt itself ripe for a division; and on what point? The question was this—whether or not they should refer the petitions to a select committee, who were to report their opinions to that House? On what were they now to be instructed to report? On something different from the contents of the petitions; on something not contemplated by the petitioners; on something not to be found in any one of those petitions. He had read the petitions down to the 26th day of May, which was the last he had printed before him. The petitions were numerous; they were various in their views, and different in their plans; but the one thing omitted in them all was this question of averages, which it appeared was the only
 736 737 "Apparent dirae facies, inimicaque Trojae "Numina magna—" 738 739 740
 Mr. Brougham  suggested, that it might be convenient if hon. gentlemen would confine themselves to the question really before the House. This was not the ordinary case, where form was of no importance, and substance every thing: the substantial question regarding the instruction to the committee would presently be introduced; for he now learnt with surprise, that the vote of last night was to go for nothing, and that a new discussion of the whole subject was to be invited: if the division and majority were indeed to be passed over he could not help it; he was ready to debate again, and to divide again only he sincerely hoped that the result would be the same. He trusted that gentlemen would so far consult the convenience of proceeding as to confine their remarks to the point of nomination; to the formation of the committee merely, for that was all that was now before the House. In his opinion, it was a great mistake to assert that eleven or even ten of the members selected, were in favour of extended relief: he had looked over the list, and could assert that there was a bare majority of those who were disposed only to inquire. The hon. members for Devonshire and for Waterford and himself were pledged only to the extent of inquiry in deference to the claims and great interests of the petitioners. They were by no means sure that any relief ought to be granted; and he mentioned this fact only to show how erroneous the impression was that the majority of the committee had pledged itself to raise the price of corn. He had been astonished at the merriment excited because the hon. member for Surrey wished to secure a majority. Suppose he were in a minority, the result would be, that on the first meeting of the committee, the chairman would be directed to report progress, and not to ask leave to sit again; or even if the numbers were equally balanced, nothing could be done, and the matter must be left in a state of neutrality and inaction. A majority was thus absolutely necessary. He pledged himself that nine gentlemen of the committee were absolutely opposed even to inquiry, and such being the fact, could any man assert that a fairer committee had been ever struck?
 Mr. Brougham  explained, that he had consented last night that some limitation should be made to the motion. What he understood that limitation to be, he had stated to the hon. member for Sussex, by whom it had been put as the amendment now before the House.
 General Gascoyne  said, there was no member of that House to whom, individually, as a member of the committee, he should object. His objection was to the constitution of the committee altogether. It was of the highest importance for the public to be convinced that the committee was selected in the most impartial way; and the mode he proposed was by ballot [cries of No, no]. Gentlemen might say "No, no;" but let the question be put, and they would then have an opportunity or supporting their negative. The feelings and even the prejudices of the public must be consulted [A laugh]. Gentlemen might laugh; but that laugh proceeded in some degree from want of reading, for it was at variance with the opinion of every author who ever wrote upon political economy. The hon. member concluded by moving, as an amendment, that the committee be chosen by ballot.
 Mr. Blackburne  begged to add his testimony to the exemplary character of the gaoler.
 Mr. Lockhart  observed, that there would be an anomaly in bringing the persons committed for a contempt of a superior court under the review of an inferior judge; and this would be the case, if the persons thus confined were put in the situation of insolvent debtors. Some of the prisoners, too, were committed, not for non-payment of money, but for re-

 Mr. Monck  thought it but just to recollect that the question related not only to the price at which the farmer could grow his corn, but to what the poor man could afford to pay for it. The great objection to the corn-laws was, that they affected the poor in a cruel and disproportionate manner. It appeared that we might now, if there was no restriction, import corn at 50 s. s. s. l. l. 719
 Mr. J. Smith  disclaimed any intention of casting the slightest reflection upon the Bank. He recollected a similar confusion some years ago, and from a suspicion of unfair practices, the transaction was referred to the examination of a committee, one of whom he happened to be, and the committee found that there was nothing of unfair preference. The confusion, indeed, arose from a trial of physical strength to get in, which, of course, respectable men would avoid; and therefore some measure should be taken, on a future occasion, to guard against such conduct.
 Mr. John Smith  did not understand that any answer had been given by the right hon. gentleman opposite to the question asked by the hon. member for Penrhyn, whether 7,000,000 l. 699 l.
 Mr. Spooner  felt a strong objection to the composition of the committee, as on looking over the list of names he found that not one member from the great manufacturing counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, or Lancashire, had been included. If any good were to be derived from the inquiry, which he greatly doubted, it must be accomplished by conveying to the public, that it had been conducted by those who were most competent to give the great subject a fair, full, and dispassionate investigation. Two points were to be considered; first, if relief were necessary, and next if that relief could be supported by the manufacturing interest. If the committee came to the conclusion that a high price for grain would relieve the manufacturers, he hoped it would not be done without at least the show of justice, by adding some members connected with the great counties he had mentioned.
 Mr. Whitbread  presented a petition from George Dewhurst, now a prisoner in the Castle of Lancaster, complaining that he had been confined for two months upon a charge of high treason, and during that time confined to hard labour, and compelled to wear the felon's dress. The charge of high treason, was afterwards abandoned, and he was subsequently tried and convicted of a misdemeanor. The petitioner further complained, that he had not been permitted to give bail upon the charge of misdemeanor, and alleged that he had been innocently led into attending a meeting on the 15th of November, 1819, which was the charge upon which he was convicted.
 Mr. Walter Burrell  remarked, that it was evidently the intention of his majesty's ministers to fritter away every power and important function of the committee. He was sorry to find that an inquiry into the distresses under which agriculturists laboured should be so strenuously opposed. On the subject of averages great abuse existed. The county of Sussex, for instance, sent its corn to the London market, and therefore the averages were taken from the latter place, where the increased charges were added, and not from the place where the corn was grown. It was high time to speak out. He was decidedly of opinion that the agriculturist must be supported, or else he could not pay his taxes. The landholder wished not for monopoly, but for justice; he wished to be enabled to pay the fundholder his dividends. It was most unfair to charge him with being the cause of those public burthens, which, in fact, were imposed by the expenditure and taxation of the country. Unaccustomed as he was to address the House, he should say no more, but conclude by moving, as an amendment, "That it be an instruction to the committee to inquire whether the present mode of taking the averages ascertains the actual market-prices of grain throughout the United Kingdom, or whether any other method may be better adapted to accomplish that purpose."
 Mr. W. Burrell  confirmed the statement of Mr. Brougham.
 Mr. Huskisson  said, he could retort on the hon. and learned gentleman the charge he had made on others of neglecting the debate; for he contended, that the amendment proposed, but not put, last night, and the motion now before the House, were in substance the same. It was quite usual for the House to restrict committees by instructions.
 Mr. W. Smith  said, that when he voted last night in favour of the committee, all he meant was, that he could not reconcile to his judgment or to his feelings to refuse to so large a proportion of the inhabitants of the country an inquiry into a subject which appeared to them to be of so much importance. He did not know how to say to the agriculturists, who stated themselves to be starving, "we will refuse to take your case into consideration." He had never intended by his vote to hold out an expectation that the committee would be able to grant a partial relief beyond what the agriculturists at present enjoyed. If the cultivators of the soil could make out a case, he did not wish to deny them the opportunity; but when the hon. member for Surrey mentioned, that he had taken care to appoint a committee which would give him a decided majority, he went a little farther than he (Mr. Smith) intended to proceed. There were two questions; first, whether the case should be taken into consideration—and upon that point the hon. gentleman was undoubtedly in the right to make out a list of members who would entertain the subject; but if he endeavoured on the second question, the relief that ought to be granted, to secure a majority for the purpose of changing the present system, and rendering it more favourable to the landed interest, then he contended, it was not such a committee as the House ought to appoint. The right hon. baronet had insisted that the members were as fair and impartial as any that could be selected. He did not mean to say that any gentleman would act unfairly according to his own views of fairness; but if 12, or 13, or even if 11 gentlemen out of 21 entered upon the inquiry with a full conviction that more relief ought to be granted to the farmers, the report would, of course, be accommodated to their views of justice and propriety.
 Mr. Wilmot  thought it was paltering with the agriculturists to grant a committee, if there was not an intention to support remedial measures in their favour. It would have been better to oppose the appointment of a committee than to resist all practical measures which it might recommend. He could not conceive any thing more futile than to agree to a motion, and then set one's face against the objects proposed. On the Catholic question, for instance, a subject which was to be shortly submitted to them, if any member were to say that he supported going into a committee, but at the same time stated his determination to oppose every object of that committee, what could be more contradictory? His own belief
 720
 Mr. Scarlett  said, he had reason to believed, from what he knew of the individual who had the charge of the castle of Lancaster, that there did not exist in the kingdom a man in the situation of gaoler who deserved more praise for the manner in which he treated the prisoners under his charge. This petitioner had been convicted of attending an unlawful meeting; and he was surprised to see it stated in the petition that the meeting had been quiet, and peaceable. It had on the contrary, been proved that many of the persons who attended it had arms with them, and that when the soldiers appeared they took off the pikes which they had before fixed on their staves.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  thought it extremely fortunate that no one had seconded the hon. general's amendment. He certainly regretted the decision which the House had come to on the preceding evening; but he trusted that the House would now take a course which should completely dissipate the alarm which, in certain quarters, that decision had excited. The country had little to fear from the committee, as proposed by the hon. member for Surrey: the members for Liverpool, London, and Bristol, afforded sufficient
 713
 Sir J. Newport  did not think the hon. member at all justified by the fact in the remarks he had made: if he (sir J. N.) entertained the same opinion of the committee, he would unquestionably refuse to belong to it. He should enter upon the inquiry with a firm conviction that it was his duty to point out such measures as, while they relieved the agriculturists, would not only not injure but advantage, every other class; and if he thought that the other gentlemen named would not commence the subject with the same disposition, he would not act with them.
 Lord Althorp  presented a petition from several persons who were confined in the prison of the Fleet for contempt of the court of chancery. One of these persons was a woman 81 years old, who had been confined for contempt 31 years. Another person was 64 years old, and had been confined 19 years; another was 60, and had been confined eight years. There was another person who would have signed the petition, but he was in a dying condition, partly, it was supposed, on account of his confinement. He presented this petition the more willingly, in order to show the necessity of extending the provisions of the Insolvent Debtors act to persons confined under contempt.
 Lord Milton,  in adverting to the arbitrary and degrading treatment to which the prisoners were subjected by this order, expressed a wish that his noble friend had been in that situation, which would have given him a control over the magistrates at the time this order was made, for in that ease he was sure that such a proceeding would never have taken place.
 Earl Temple  entertained a hope that, as the committee was appointed, its inquiries might be productive of advantage; but at the same time he took this occasion of stating, that he for one would resist any measure that might be introduced, the object of which was to add to the price to be paid by the labouring classes for their corn or bread. They ought to be cautious how they raised the provisions beyond the ability of the people to purchase. Had he been present on the preceding night, he should indeed have felt inclined to oppose the appointment of a committee on the subject. He was certainly not prepared to name any specific remedy for the distresses of the agriculturists; but he thought it clear that these were not times for tampering with the feelings of the community. They were not times for legislating on the price of an article necessary to the existence of all. He did not mean, however, to say, that he regretted the appointment of a committee, because he trusted some good might arise from it; and with this impression he should vote for the original motion.
 Mr. Maxwell  rose to present a petition from the distressed mechanics of the town of Paisley, who prayed the House to afford them the means of emigration to one of the colonies. The petitioners preferred Canada. One observation suggested by the petitioners was well worthy of the attention of the House. They deprecated poor-rates as degrading to themselves, and an evil to their country. It was manifest that what was given to support the poor, who had no employment was taken from the capital of the country. If they were not employed, they consumed without re-producing, and were thus useless in the community. They increased, therefore, the proportion of population beyond the proportion of produce. He was sorry that his majesty's ministers had not applied to that House for means of giving effectual support to emigration. The distress of the petitioners, like that of many others, was not owing to variations of the market, but to the annihilation of their trade. When England had been the only country which afforded security for the employment of capital, and when the decrees of Milan and the orders in council had put an end to all neutral commerce, the natural consequence had been, that those who felt no security for capital, and found no scope for their industry and skill elsewhere, should come to this country, and employ here their capital and their skill; but when this state of things was entirely changed, those who had come to this country became unprovided for. They, therefore, set up or revived manufactures in their own country. When he heard particular cases of distress urged upon the attention of the House; when he heard the distresses of agriculturists discussed, as they had been last night, he thought some alleviation might be provided. But it was impossible to give
 745
 Mr. Frederick Campbell  rose, in pursuance of the notice which he had given of a motion relative to the situation of the Welsh Judges, and the regulation of the court of judicature in Wales. The subject, in his opinion, deserved the most serious consideration of the House, as it was an attempt to remedy some of the defects, as he must term them, of the court of judicature in Wales. The remedy which he should propose for those defects was not founded on any newfangled theory, but on the opinions of men who could only desire change, because in their consciences they believed change to be necessary. Indeed, one of them, lord Colchester, whilst practising as a barrister on the Chester circuit, had pointed out
 746 747 concedit solvere, capias 748 certiorari 749 750
 Mr. F. Campbell  denied having made any personal observations.
 Lord John Russell  disclaimed the tirade attributed to him by the hon. and learned gentleman. He indeed recollected to have seen such a tirade ascribed to him, in what purported to be a report of his speech, in one of the newspapers usually devoted to the service of administration, namely, that the hon. and learned gentleman was always ready to support the unconstitutional measures of his majesty's ministers. What could induce the reporter to ascribe these words to him, or the learned gentleman to conclude that he uttered them, he could not pretend to say. But he certainly had never said any thing of the kind. What he really had said on the occasion alluded to was this, that the judgeship which the learned gentleman occupied was usually granted as a reward or retainer for the support of ministerial measures, while that judgeship was generally a step towards other offices, the holders of which were always the supporters of the minister of the day—that is, that the chief justice ship of Chester was usually a step towards the offices of either attorney or solicitor general, which was an observation fully justified by experience. It was well known that the act which rendered the English judges independent of the Crown had given universal satisfaction; and looking to the principle and purpose of that act, he was at a loss to imagine any defence that could be framed for placing the Welsh judges in a dif-
 755
 Mr. Wynn  regretted the personalities that had been indulged in. When the former report was made, the present chief justice of Chester was not a member of that House. The committee of 1817 did much; but in the absence of so many members, they did not give any positive opinion as to the Welsh judges. With respect to the motion, he felt some difficulty. His own opinion always was, that the abolition of the present system of Welsh judicature could not all at once be effected, or effected with immediate advantage. At the same time, he
 756
 Colonel Wood,  who had also been a member of that committee, said, that the opinion of Mr. Ponsonby, whose name would always be looked up to with respect, had at one time been strongly in favour of abolishing the Welsh system of judicature altogether; and it was but fair to state the manly and candid manner in which that lamented individual acted as chairman. He did distinctly understand Mr. Ponsonby's opinion to have been completely changed by the evidence laid before the committee, and that he thought, on examination into the subject, that the Welsh judicature: possessed many advantages, and should not be done away with altogether.—Among all the witnesses examined before; the committee, there was only one, a; Mr. Owen, who wished the system to be abolished. No question had been put to any of the witnesses, as to the propriety of these judges sitting in that House; nor was there any occasion for hearing evidence on that point before a committee, because it was a question on which the House was able to judge without any such inquiry. One ground of complaint had been, that in consequence of the ambulatory habits of the equity barristers who attended the circuits, the suitors in the courts of equity; in Wales could not sometimes get their causes heard for six months. This he I thought a less hardship than it had been represented; for he believed that many; of the suitors in the equity courts of England would be very well satisfied if they could obtain a hearing in six years. The hon. gentleman proceeded to state various arguments against; the abolition of the present system. One: reason for not including Wales in the circuits was, that many of the witnesses I could not speak a word of English. But
 757
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that the hon. gentleman who had just spoken had done no more than justice to his majesty's ministers in supposing that they neither had nor could have any other object, upon this question, than that that should be done which was best calculated to render justice to so large a class of his majesty's subjects. For himself he had no difficulty in saying, that he had come into that House under this general impression upon the subject—that it had already undergone, the most elaborate examination—that every possible inquiry had been made, and every possible evidence obtained from the most able and intelligent persons; and therefore he had conceived that all topics which could now be proposed to be submitted to a com-
 762 763 764 765
 Mr. Bathurst  defended the character of the Welsh judges from the imputations which he conceived had been unjustly thrown upon them. It was true that A or B might have received an opinion from one of those judges in his capacity of barrister, but was that judge to be taunted with having held a different opinion on a subsequent occasion on the bench? It was known that the great lord Mansfield had, when a barrister, held opinions which he had subsequently found it necessary to change. But surely that learned judge did not deserve to have this alteration of opinion held up as a reproach against him. He supported the amendment of his noble friend.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that his early recollections impelled him to do justice to the Welsh bar and bench. Unless a great change had taken place in the judicature of that part of the country within the last twenty years, which he believed was not the case, both the bench and bar were entitled to the greatest respect. He recollected when he had the honour of practising at the Welsh bar that the bench was filled by men of the highest respectability and talent. Mr. Lloyd,
 767
 Mr. Campbell  addressed the House in reply. After some allusions to the salaries of Welsh judges, and to the opinion given by lord Bulkeley before the last committee, he observed, that he had no personal enmity to any of those gentlemen; on the contrary, he had the highest respect for many of them. There was one for instance, Mr. Heywood, for whom he had the highest esteem and friendship. There was no man more respectable in his profession—there was no man whose character was more strikingly contrasted with that of another individual spoken of that evening. He had accepted his situation without any compromise of principle; he had never held a seat in that House. He had no objection to accede to the amendment of the noble lord.
 Mr. Robinson  entertained great doubts as to the beneficial tendency or good policy of legislative interference in the agreements between master and workmen. Restrictions of the kind now proposed had existed for a long time, and it might be a delicate question, whether they ought immediately to be abolished; but he had no difficulty in saying that if we had to begin again, he would not countenance such a policy. He would not oppose the introduction of the bill, but neither would he pledge himself to its future support.
 Colonel Wood  hoped that time would be allowed to spread the knowledge of the measure throughout the country before the bill passed into a law, as he had received notice from Wales that there would be petitions against it from those connected with the iron-works in that quarter.
 Mr. Baring  regretted that such a motion should have been made. He was aware of the good intentions of the hon. mover, but he thought the question of such importance, that a committee ought to be appointed upon it. He hoped the hon. mover would see the propriety of altering his motion to that effect.
 Mr. Maberly  rose, pursuant to notice, to bring under the consideration of the House the propriety of continuing the Bounties on the Exportation of British and Irish Linens, and with this view, he moved, that the 29 Geo. 2nd, c. 15, the 3 Geo. 3rd, c. 12, the 23 Geo. 3rd. c. 14, the 46 Geo. 3rd, c. 29, and the 51 Geo. 3rd, c. 14, be read. The said acts being accordingly entered as read, the hon. member moved,—"That this House will to-morrow resolve itself into a committee of the whole House, to consider of the said acts."
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  was of opinion that it would be better if this question were brought forward by some member of the executive government, but, at all events, it was not necessary to introduce it now, because the acts providing for those bounties would not expire till next year. The intermediate period would allow the executive government to determine whether they would or would not continue them. He was anxious that the different parts of the United Kingdom should be placed as nearly as possible on the same level with respect to trade, but he was the more ready to put off the consideration of this question, because he thought the whole subject of the encouragement of trade was likely at an early period to come under the consideration of parliament. He would therefore take the liberty of moving the previous question.
 Mr. Maberly  expressed great surprise at the manner in which his motion had been treated. After he was given to un-
 772
 Mr. Robinson  expressed regret at any misunderstanding to which he unintentionally had given rise. He certainly stated, in answer to a noble lord opposite (Milton), that it was but just and expedient that the bounty enjoyed by the Irish manufacturer should be extended to the Scotch and the English, but he did not pledge himself to any continuance of the bounty. Scotland and England had the same right to bounty for the exportation, of linen as Ireland; but as the act would expire in 1821, none of the three kingdoms could claim its continuance beyond that time. He had, in fact, declined giving any assurance to the hon. gentleman on the subject till the period when the bounties should expire, which would be in March 1821. When the hon. gentleman stated his determination to bring it forward immediately, he had replied, that the hon. gentleman was master of his own-conduct, and would of course exercise his own discretion; but he was not surprised that his right hon. friend should deem the motion premature. He was no great authority on the construction of acts of parliament, but it was well understood, that when a law was passed for continuing a former law, its operation reverted to the period when the former law ceased to exist. He certainly had, upon communication with the parties, admitted that, in fairness and justice, they were entitled to the same advantage as the manufacturers of Ireland. Although he thought the mo-
 773
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  expressed his regret at having misconceived the understanding which it now appeared had been come to between the hon. gentleman and his right hon. friend. With the permission of the House, he would withdraw, under these circumstances, his motion for the previous question.
 Mr. Maberly  observed, that nothing could be more distinct than the communication which had passed between Mr. Robinson and himself. He had shown to the right hon. gentleman the paper, which he intended to submit to the committee, nor had the slightest intention of apposing the bill which he was desirous of introducing, been signified. Pie thought himself therefore warranted in the observations which he had made, and he hoped he should not be excluded from resuming those observations as far as they related to the act of union.
 Mr. Robinson  thought it would be an extraordinary proceeding to send such an instruction as this to a committee of the whole House. It was the addition of a matter that had no connexion with the subject into which the committee was appointed to inquire. The first object that
 774
 Mr. Bankes,  conceived that the terms of the instruction being in some degree imperative, brought the whole question now before the House.
 Mr. Maberly  declared himself quite willing to defer to the sense of the House, or the opinion of the Chair.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose, pursuant to the notice he had given, to move for leave to bring in a Bill to continue the Alien act, and to abolish naturalization, arising from the purchase of stock in Scotland. The bill intended to continue the act for the same period during which it had been lately in force namely, two years. This was the fifth time which this question had been brought under the consideration of parliament.
 775 776 777 778 779 780
 The Solicitor General  begged leave to say, that Mr. Capper apprized general Gourgaud of the nature of his business before he arrested him.
 Lord Castlereagh,  in reply, said, that he did not recollect the case with the government of the Netherlands to which the hon. member for Durham alluded. When Las Casas was sent out of this country, it was not with any view that he was to be taken into custody on his arrival in the Netherlands. As to the Holy Alliance, he denied that this country was a party to it in any diplomatic sense of the word. There was no understanding connected with it by which we were to send obnoxious foreigners out of the country. On the contrary, he thought that other countries had a right to complain of the indulgence shown to foreigners, considering the powers which this law placed in our hands. He never heard any government complain of the act, or adopt any measures hostile to the passages of Englishmen through their kingdom in consequence of it. Cer-
 798
 The Solicitor General  said, he should rot have risen upon the present occasion were ft not for some observations that had fallen from the gallant general, and the statement made by him with respect to the abuse of the law. Had it been abused, as the gallant general said, there would certainly be a strong ground for opposing the motion; but the charges brought forward had not the slightest foundation in truth. With respect to the case of general Gourgaud, it was, on a former occasion, brought before the House in the shape of a petition. All the statements now made by the gallant officer were then advanced, and they were every one contradicted. No answer was given to that contradiction. If the charges could have been made out, it was the duty of those who brought them forward to appoint a day for taking the allegations of the petition into consideration. That not being done, was sufficient evidence that those allegations could not be supported by proof. The gallant officer himself, took great pains to ascertain the truth. He wrote to a person at Harwich, and put various questions a3 to the treatment of general Gourgaud. These questions were all answered, but the answers were never brought under the consideration of the House. General Gourgaud was allowed to go before a magistrate at Harwich. Gentlemen were permitted to visit him while there; and if he had any ground for complaint, he had full opportunity of proving it.—It was not true that he paid the expenses of the officers who attended him: he paid his own expenses, but he insisted on doing so; and he had instituted no complaint of improper conduct on the part of the officers. Yet, when the case was before the House, the gallant general had not had the candour to state what he had done, or what had resulted from his inquiries. Had the charges in the petition been brought forward, they could have been most triumphantly refuted. He would undertake to say, that every statement in the petition was a falsehood. When Mr. Capper, with his assistants, entered the general's lodgings, and was proceeding to the performance of his duty with propriety, he perceived him endeavouring, to get hold of a case of pitols on his chimney-piece. Some force then became necessary. He insisted upon having his papers. They were given to him, and he put his seal on
 788 789 790
 Mr. C. B. Wall  said, that in the year 1715 aliens were protected by a commercial treaty. It had been observed, that there had been no abuse of the powers conferred by this measure, and it
 786
 Mr. Warren  resumed. The hon. gentleman had certainly said that all were obscure and all were ignorant. The hon. gentleman, living in the part of the country in which he did, could not but know that there were persons who filled situations of as high honour and integrity, and as much professional knowledge as ever presided over any court of justice. One of them was a friend of the hon. gentleman, a most esteemed friend of the late Mr. Fox, and appointed by Mr. Fox to the situation. Nothing but the desire of sinking Welsh judges to the lowest abyss of infamy, could have induced the hon. gentleman to assert, not only that all who now existed, but that all who ever had existed, were corrupt. Did the hon. gentleman ever hear of sir William Grant? He thought not. Of lord Kenyon, of lord Redesdale, of sir Vicary Gibbs, of the present lord chief justice of the Common Pleas? He thought not. If the hon. gentleman had recollected that all these distinguished persons had, at one period of their lives, presided over the courts of Wales, he would scarcely have passed such a sweeping censure upon all Welsh judges. He did not know whether he was himself considered an obscure and ignorant person. Pie had once many friends on the opposite side of the House [Hear!]; and he hoped he still continued to retain their friendship, though he was aware that little dependence could be placed on the continuance of friendship where party considerations interfered. In looking round the House, he saw many gentlemen on both sides of the House who had done him the honour to employ him [Hear, hear!]. He would take that opportunity of alluding to some observations of a noble lord opposite, which he had seen in the public prints, and which evidently alluded to himself; they were in the same spirit as the tirade which had been just uttered by the hon. gentleman, and he begged to assure the noble lord
 752 753
 Mr. Warren,  chief justice of Chester, said, that in the violent tirade which the hon. gentleman had just delivered against Welsh judges, he had made no exception. Welsh judges in times past and time present, were equally denounced, and even Welsh judges in time to come were to be affected by the contagion of their example. With respect to those observations which applied to himself—
 Mr. Littleton  could not help feeling some doubt on the subject, after the opi-
 771
 Mr. Littleton  now rose to bring forward his motion, for leave to bring in a bill, to amend the laws in existence, for obliging the persons who employ labourers and workmen to pay their wages in money, and not in goods or other equivalents. The hon. member shortly explained the object of his intended bill; namely, to
 769 770
 Mr. Tierney  was of opinion that his hon. friend had adopted the proper course, and made his motion at the right time. It was not to pass without discussion, but the discussion would regularly take place when the committee should be appointed.
 Mr. Wrottesley  expressed his satisfaction that the attention of the eminent individuals who had just spoken had been called to the subject.
 Mr. Wrottesley  thought it his duty as the evidence which had been brought before the committee which was formerly appointed by the House to inquire into this subject had been so frequently alluded to this night to say, that as much of it was procured as every member of the committee thought necessary. And it was but justice to say, that every possible I diligence was used by the late right hon. gentleman who was the chairman, to enable them to come to a proper and final determination upon the question submitted to them. It had been determined to meet, for the purpose of making a full report, when, in the mean time, that deplorable event which all the country sincerely regretted took place. Consequently the committee never did meet again; but it was thought necessary that a report of some kind should be agreed upon; and,
 758
 Mr. Allen  said, that the hon. colonel, who was not, he believed, a Welshman, although he represented a Welsh county, had given a representation of the opinions of his constituents and neighbours upon this question very different from that which lie (Mr. Allen) should give of those entertained in that part of the country with which he was himself connected. With respect to the petition which had been presented recently from Carmarthen,
 759 760 * * 761
 Mr. Lambton  stated, that he had, in 1818, moved for the papers respecting an alien sent out of the country at the request of the government of the Netherlands.
 Mr. Lambton  did not intend to occupy much of the time of the House. He only rose for the purpose of remarking on some observations which had fallen from the hon. and learned solicitor-general. He did not remember whether that hon. and learned gentleman was in the House at the period of his (Mr. Lambton's) presenting a petition to which he had alluded. If he were he must have grossly misunderstood what he had said on the occasion; or if he had not, he must have received a most erroneous account of what had occurred. At the time when he presented the petition from general Gourgaud, in 1818, he had asked the noble lord to consent to a committee, in which he would pledge himself to bring proof of the facts stated. The noble lord refused that committee; and he (Mr. Lambton) did not attempt to bring the matter again forward, because he knew it would be of no avail without the committee, and, aware of the manner in which the House was constituted, he well knew that it was hopeless to expect that when the noble lord had refused his consent. As to the statements now made, they rested on the credit of the petition, or on that of the hon. and learned gentlemen—which of them the House might believe, he would not pretend to say, but he thought the one entitled to as much respect as the other. The hon. and learned gentleman had stated, that general Gourgaud had seized his pistols when the officers approached to arrest him;—that might be true—but was it not natural for a man of his rank, to attempt to defend himself when he had been so intruded upon by strangers? It was also true that the general was allowed to seal his paper—but it was likewise a fact, which had been ascertained on the authority of the consul at Hamburgh, that that seal had been broken, and the portfolio returned the general opened. As to the questions of which the hon. and learned gentleman had
 797
 Mr. Barham  wished to take the earliest opportunity of rectifying a mistake into which he had unintentionally fallen. In speaking or Mr. Justice Lloyd, he had imputed to that gentleman certain matters which'he believed were chargeable not against him, but another individual.
 Mr. Barham,  as a member of the committee to which this subject had been formerly referred, said, that the last time he asked his lamented friend Mr. Ponsonby, what he thought would be the result of the investigation, respecting the system of Welsh judicature, his answer was in the singular terms, "that he thought it would be the best way to get it into the great boat." He had heard his right hon. friend express the most decided opinion, that the system of the appointment of the Welsh judges was most corrupt. He used to say that it was generally a job. Certainly the hon. mover had never declared any thing so preposterous as that every Welsh judge who had been appointed was ignorant and corrupt. But he said that they were not appointed as the English judges were, on whose appointment no suspicion ever rested; as they were obviously selected for their character and learning. If he were asked if he had not heard of sir William Grant, and other eminent men who had been Welsh judges, he would reply, yes; but he would ask, in return, if his interrogator had never heard of a Welsh judge who was appointed after having relinquished his profession for ten years, and who was the clerk of the king's kitchen at the time; and whether he would lay his hand on his breast, and say that he did not believe the appointment of that individual grew out of some transactions in a borough in the county of Surrey? There had been several other Welsh Judges; among the rest two of the names of Lloyd and Popham, who were by no means fit for that situation. In proof of the evils arising from allowing any man to hold a judicial situation, who
 766
 Mr. Hume  said, the present law was evaded, but he would rather that the fifteen restrictive acts should be repealed, and a perfect freedom of making agreements allowed between master and workman, than that new enactments should be made which would likewise be evaded. He strongly objected to the continuance of the combination laws, the repeal of which would go far to satisfy the bulk of the labouring poor.
 Mr. R. Martin  regretted extremely to have heard so many pointed allusions hurled at his hon. and learned friend, from the opposite side of the House, where his hon. and learned friend had long sat, although he was now transferred to his side. But he did not learn that he had belied any principle on one side, which he had professed on the other. He remembered an expression of the late Mr. Ponsonby, who had long been considered by the gentlemen opposite as a staunch patriot and an ornament to their ranks, an expression worthy of being recorded. It was, that a man who had been a patriot out of office, might be doubly a patriot in office; and he hoped that maxim would be repeated now with some advantage to the country, and be favourably received by the gentlemen opposite, and induce some of them to come over to his side, and display their patriotism with so much more advantage to their country. The imputation suggested against his hon. and learned friend, of delivering opinions as a judge different from those he had professed as a barrister, might with equal justice be applied to every judge on the bench. It was in the very nature of things, that a gentleman of the bar, feed to support one side of a cause, and bound to use his best exertions for his client, should urge arguments, and profess opinions which, as a judge, calmly viewing both sides of the case, he would not avow from the bench; and on
 768
 Mr. Creevey  declared, that he was not able to see upon what ground, while the English judges were excluded from seats in that House, the Welsh judges should be allowed to sit there. The object of the law which excluded the English judges obviously was, to preserve the bench from any taint of political or party bias, and with the same view those judges were rendered independent of the Crown. If, then, it was deemed proper to keep the judges from among those who were within the sphere of political action or influence, why should the Welsh judges be allowed to sit in that House? The conduct, indeed, of the learned gentleman himself, who had just sat down, furnished a strong argument, if any were wanted, to show that the judges should not be allowed to have seats in that House.—He had known his learned friend, if he would allow him now so to call him, for above twenty years, during which he could not say that he agreed with the learned gentleman in political opinion, as that learned gentleman went generally much farther than he could [Hear, hear!]. The learned gentleman, indeed, usually concurred with the hon. baronet, the member for Westminster, who was uniformly the subject of his most fervent panegyric. What, then, was the inference from the extraordinary change which had taken place
 754
 Mr. Denman,  in answer to the question put to him by the hon. member, hoped he should never have cause to be ashamed of any opinion he had ever delivered in that House, or elsewhere; nor did he fear that any opinion he had delivered or should deliver in that House or any where else would ever rise in judgment against him; nor should he desert those opinions in any situation in which he might be placed.
 Mr. W. Smith  agreed with the general principle of leaving trade free, although the practice was against that doctrine. He thought a motion for a committee would have been better; because, if the allegations were proved, that would support the necessity for the bill. If not, there would have been good grounds for repealing the acts altogether. At any rate, he could not agree to a denial of a consideration of the subject.
 The Speaker  reminded the hon. gentleman that the question originally was, that certain acts be entered as read, and that the House do resolve itself into a committee on the following day, to consider of them. Upon this the chancellor of the exchequer had moved the previous question; but, after an explanation of something which had passed between the hon. mover and a right hon. gentleman permission had been asked of the House to withdraw it. The only question now was, that the House should resolve itself into a committee of the whole House to-morrow, to take the subject into consideration.
 The Speaker  said, that, without reference to the arguments adduced on either side, it must be the wish of the House that its forms should be complied with. It was clear that, if the terms of the motion were imperative, it was no instruction at all; and that it must be brought forward in another shape in the committee, and make part of its report with a view to a future bill. But in this case the instruction was not imperative, and the real difficulty which he felt, arose from a doubt whether it was competent to make such an instruction referring to matters which, without it, the committee could not consider on any day but that on which the committee was appointed. It was, however, substantially inconsistent with their forms to take any step, or express any opinion, prior to the time of discussion.
 Mr. Chetwynd  thought what had passed in the House that night quite a sufficient reason for a change of system with regard to the Welsh judges. For to see a gentleman who wore the robe of a judge, standing in that House to plead and at liberty to decide in a cause in which he was personally interested, appeared to him a very great anomaly. He really thought that ministers would do well to give up the source of patronage which they possessed, from having Welsh judges sitting in that House. He had no doubt, indeed, that such a surrender would serve very considerably to advance the character of his majesty's ministers, and he was as anxious as any man that that character should stand high in public estimation. At an early period of the reign of Geo. 2nd, it was enacted that the Scotch baron should not be allowed to sit in that House, and the English judges were also excluded. The judges then both of England and Scotland being prohibited from sitting in that House, he could not see upon what ground the Welsh judges should be allowed to sit there. Another objection to the present system of the Welsh judges was, that they were allowed to practise as barristers in this part of the kingdom; and thus a suitor on the Chester circuit had an opportunity of ascertaining, perhaps of prepossessing the mind of the judge who was to try he cause. On these grounds he should support the motion.
 Mr. W. Parnell  had heard with the utmost pain the observations upon his learned friend the present chief justice of Chester. It was impossible for his learned friend to have accepted the situation from any base or unworthy motive; he took it probably from an honourable love of influence and power, that he might enjoy more extensive means of doing good, and contributing to the welfare of his country.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  would not object to the introduction of the bill, though he thought the hon. gentleman would effect a more beneficial object by moving for a repeal of all former enactments that interfered between master and workmen. He was convinced that the best remedy for the evils complained of would be, to abolish all restrictions. He reserved to himself the right of opposing this bill in its future stages.
 Sir James Mackintosh  said, that at so late an hour of the night, and so much exhausted as he felt himself, he should have been unwilling to say any thing on a subject on which at former times, and at great length, he had felt it necessary to trespass on the indulgence of the House, had not his opinion been specially called for by his hon. and learned friend in a manner for which he was certainly very grateful. As that had been done, he should now on the first stage trouble the House with a few words on a measure, to every stage of which he should offer his most decided opposition, reserving for a future occasion a more detailed statement of his reasons. In making these observations it was not his intention to enter into a controversy as, to particular facts, arising from the. cases which had been mentioned by his gallant friend; in the first place, because he was not acquainted-with the circumstances of those cases, and must, therefore, leave
 791 792 i 793 794 795 796
 Mr. Scarlett  said, that the anecdote about the Welsh judge acting as counsel, and delivering an opinion in the one capacity which he reversed in the other, was certainly possible, and as such it was a good illustration of the inconvenience of uniting the two characters.
 Sir Robert Wilson  was aware that it was rather unusual to debate a question on the motion for leave to bringin a bill; but the present question was of such a nature as to justify him in coming forward thus early to resist its introduction, and he had the satisfaction to know that many members approved of the course
 781 782 783 784 785 l. s. d.
 Sir John Newport  remarked, that the subject matter of the instruction was. altogether extraneous to the question which the committee would have to consider.
 Lord Milton  apprehended that the House would be travelling rather too fast in immediately assenting to this new proposition without any discussion. It seemed to him that it would be early enough to bring forward this question on the following day.
 Mr. Bennet  proposed a clause which had been suggested last year, but not adopted, to deprive persons of full age I who should marry minors, of the power of annulling such marriages by suits instituted by themselves, at any time or under any circumstances On the ground of minority. The licences were in most cases' obtained by the wilful perjury of the adults, and it was therefore highly improper that they should be at liberty to | derive a double advantage from such perjury, first, that of accomplishing the marriage, and next, that of avoiding it.
 Dr. Lushington  observed, that the clause required some alteration, and it was in consequence ultimately postponed, in order to be introduced in a subsequent stage of the bill.—The House then resumed, and the report was ordered to be received on Thursday.
 Mr. Curwen,  on presenting a petition from the woollen cloth manufacturers of Keswick, took occasion to remark upon the state of their trade, observing, that the petitioners deprecated the intention, which they understood existed, of continuing what were called the protecting duties upon Irish linen.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  was averse to protecting duties, and would oppose their imposition, if they were now about to be laid on; but he thought that the manufactures of Ireland ought to meet with encouragement as well as those of England. He wished his right hon. friend would state what course it was his intention to adopt, for that would serve to remove from the minds of the manufacturers in Ireland that suspense, which was highly unfavourable to them.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the subject was at present undergoing a special inquiry; but he had no hesitation to state, that it was not in his contemplation to propose the immediate repeal of the duties alluded to. Those duties had existed since the Union
 803
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that the proposition of a gradual repeal of these duties was deemed necessary, to afford time to the parties immediately interested, to prepare for their ultimate and complete repeal, which it was in the contemplation of his majesty's ministers to propose.
 Mr. Hutchinson  expressed his concurrence in sentiment with the hon. member for Portarlington, as to the principle of protecting duties; and if the duties under consideration were now for the first time proposed, he apprehended that few would be found to support the proposition. But from local knowledge, as well as from general information, he was enabled to say, that the immediate repeal of those duties would be productive of the worst effects in Ireland. It was therefore wise on the part of ministers to determine upon some further continuance of that degree of protection to the trade of Ireland which these duties afforded, as that trade was known to stand so much in need of encouragement. It was very desirable that those engaged in this trade in Ireland, should not be kept much longer in suspense as to the intention of the chancellor of the exchequer; for as the duties alluded to were not long to continue ac-
 804
 Mr. Bennet  maintained, that in the original act of parliament imposing the 4½ per cent duties it was expressly stated that they were for assisting in the protection of the Leeward islands. Subsequently, in the reign of Charles 2nd, they were taken as a part of the hereditary
 820
 Lord Castlereagh  did think, and he was sure the feelings of the House and the country would go with him, that the mode in which the two honourable members had expressed themselves, in relation to the fees of the tellerships of the exchequer, was neither fair, candid, liberal, nor just. It would have been but justice to say, that this fund had lapsed into the hands of the noble marquis, who had exhibited such unexampled disinterestedness and public spirit in sacrificing his
 821
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  repeated his assertion, that the noble marquis in question had made large sacrifices to the public interest long before the observations in parliament of the hon. gentleman opposite.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the hon. gentleman had excited his astonishment and sorrow, and done himself very little credit by the manner in which he had treated one of the most liberal and public-spirited acts ever done in this or in any country—[Hear, hear!]. The lofty and generous conduct of the marquis, of which the hon. gentleman had spoken so lightly, had drawn forth the universal respect and gratitude of this country, and he believed of Europe. The hon. gentleman had taken on himself the credit of having compelled the noble marquis by the observations he had made in the House, to give up those official emolu-
 819
 Mr. Fyshe Palmer  was anxious to draw the attention of the House to the subject of the driver corps, the skeleton of which was still kept up in Wales, but for what purpose of national utility he bad not been able to discover. He apprehended, likewise, that if the military college was still necessary, it ought to be placed on the most economical footing. He was far indeed from admitting that necessity, and was persuaded that one-half of what was laid out at Sandhurst would cover the entire expense of Marlow. It appeared to him that a most enormous sum had been expended in buildings, from which the public service could derive no adequate compensation.
 Colonel Davies  regretted that those individuals who took an active part in the discussion of a corn bill, or a commercial or agricultural measure, did not seem inclined to devote their talents to the important subject now under consideration.
 831
 Mr. Price  said, he had conversed with many persons who had relations in the hospital, all of whom concurred in speaking of it in terms of the highest praise. There were some who, after having been three or four years in other places under the army surgeons, and discharged at length as incurables, were restored to sight by sir William Adams.
 Mr. Hutchinson  said, that the respectable individual at the head of the establishment now under consideration, had been hardly dealt with in many instances, and regretted that his hon. friend, the member for Shrewsbury, should have spoken as he had, under a misconception
 836 837
 Mr. Bennet  read an extract from the report of the three medical gentlemen appointed by the board, in which they stated, that the appearances were still more unfavourable than before. He did not mean to deny that sir W. Adams had performed great cures, but that they were not so numerous as to justify the continuance of the establishment. l.
 Mr. Bennet  said, the noble lord had stated that the Ophthalmic establishment cost the country about 2,000 l. 834 l.; 835
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that he could never be brought to believe that there was any thing blameable in the transaction alluded to. The Crown had called those troops into existence, it was true, in October last; but no sooner had parliament assembled, than this fact was made known to it.
 Mr. Tennyson  said, that although it was not without becoming hesitation that he differed from the right hon. and learned judge upon such a subject yet as he thought that the purport of the clause had been misunderstood, he did not despair of satisfying him of its propriety. In the first place, it had not been before rejected, as the right hon. gentleman supposed, for he (Mr. T.) was the individual who bad then brought it forward, and had merely withdrawn it at the instance of the hon. and learned member who introduced the bill, lest, though he knew not why, it should not be acceptable in another place. Next, he thought, that so far from being at variance with the principle of the Marriage act, it was precisely correspondent to that principle, which was a principle of protection to minors against indiscreet connexions. It was amply sufficient for this object to enable the minor to avoid the marriage, without leaving the adult at
 802
 Mr. Ricardo  observed, that it seemed to be admitted on all sides, that these protecting duties ought to be repealed. They had existed for 20 years, which surely was a period quite long enough to give the Irish manufacturers an opportunity of preparing for their repeal, if any such opportunity were necessary; and he really could see no reason for their further continuance.
 Colonel Trench  was anxious to offer a few observations in defence of the establishment at Sandhurst. It was described as unfitted and unsuited for the purpose contemplated; observations were made on the extent of the fund appropriated to its support; and reflexions were also cast on the mode of education pursued in that
 832 833
 Lord Nugent  maintained, that the answer which the noble lord had just given to a question proposed to him by a nobles lord was by no means satisfactory. Those 11,000 veterans were certainly levied in a manner contrary both to the Bill of Rights and to the articles of the Mutiny act.
 Lord Nugent  was ready to admit, that
 839
 Lord Nugent  stated, that it was not his intention on the present occasion to go into all the objections which he entertained to the resolution now moved. One reason for his declining to do so was the evident indisposition of the noble lord. His objections, too, did not so much apply to the details embraced in the estimates now laid upon their table, as to the principle of maintaining so enormous a military establishment in time of peace. It was an establishment which he saw nothing to justify in the situation of Europe, or in our own domestic circumstances. The noble lord had not attempted to bring forward any argument to prove its necessity, but had rested its defence on the ground of public notoriety. Such a ground might appear satisfactory to the noble lord, but, in his opinion, a large military force was not a suitable remedy for popular discontent, arising from actual misery, and increased by the disastrous state of our finances. If complaints of taxation were to be met by enlarged establishments, it was obvious that we should move on in a circle till some final rupture took place between the Crown and the people, the issue of which must be either to confirm disaffection, or to establish a military government and a military police. Having made

 Mr. Goulburn  stated, that there was a militia set on foot in the Ionian islands, the drilling and superintending of whom had devolved on the staff. Whether they were so occupied at present he could not say. The hon. gentleman, in answer to the observation made by Mr. Hume, observed, that that there was a saving of upwards of 11,000 l.
 Mr. Wrottesley  moved an amendment to the effect, that parties so circumstanced should have six months after the passing of the bill within which suits might be commenced though both parties had attained majority.
 General Gascoyne  said, that as far as the knowledge of his constituents went, they believed the timber imported from the British American Colonies to be their growth. It was also to be recollected, that the return sent from this country in payment of that timber was in salt, to the amount of 40,000 tons.
 General Gascoyne  presented a petition from some merchants, ship-owners, and otheiss, in Liverpool. The prayer of the petition might appear somewhat inconsistent, as it favoured a relaxation of the Navigation laws, and yet opposed any alteration of the acts respecting foreign timber. They expressed themselves much interested in not narrowing their trade with our North-American colonies. He should say no more at present upon the subject, reserving himself till a city member, who had given notice of a motion connected with this question, should bring the subject fully under discussion.
 Mr. Barham  said, his hon. friend had taken an erroneous view of the Ophthalmic establishment. He had got hold of a pamphlet, entitled "A Report submitted to the commander-in-chief on Ophthalmia;" and he seemed to conclude that it contained the judgment of a board of persons, to whom it was referred to decide on the disputes relative to this establishment. This was entirely a mistake: it was a private publication, printed by themselves, and was merely the reply of one party to the statement of the other. The hon. gentleman stated the number of pensions granted for diseases in the eye before the appointment of the Ophthalmic institution, and the number of persons pronounced incurable by army-surgeons cured at the Ophthalmic institution, in order to prove the utility of that institution.
 Mr. Hume  referred to the reports of the finance committee to show that from 1715 to the year 1786 the 4½ per cent duties had been included in the revenue. It was not until the last-mentioned year, when the consolidated fund was established, that they were no longer comprehended in the general revenue, so that the right hon. gentleman's statement respecting them was perfectly unfounded.
 Mr. Hume  considered that the House and the country were much indebted to an hon. and gallant officer (colonel Davies) who had recently called their attention to the subject of our military expenditure. It was undoubtedly a little singular to find, in the first place, so large an increase in the number of life-guards. That number, in the year 1792, was 695, and now amounted to 1,305. He was sure he was not exceeding the truth, when he estimated the cost of every individual in that corps, including horses and accoutrements, at 142 l. l. 827 l. l. l. l, l. l. s. l. s. d. l. l. 828 l., l. l., l. l. l. l. 829 l., l. s. l. l. l., 830 l. l., l.,
 Mr. Hume  thought that, in calling the attention of the committee to the amount of these estimates, he should save the time of the committee, if, instead of entering into minute particulars, he looked at the total amount under each head. The object of the committee should be, to see what was the total expense of the ordnance service for this year, compared with that for the last; and whether the circumstances of the country were such as to warrant the present amount. With this view he should take the simple method of showing the difference between the estimates of the last and the present years, rather than follow the

 Dr. Phillimore  cited several cases of infinite hardship occasioned by nullity of marriage in consequence of minority.
 Mr. R. Ward  said, that the hon. gentleman in the course of his remarks had not pointed out a single place or establishment which he thought should be suppressed. He called on the hon. gentleman to name one that could be dispensed with; though he did not pledge himself that those who had the charge of this department of the public service would accede to the recommendation of the hon. gentleman, because he conceived that from their experience they were best able to judge what establishments were necessary. He thought, however, that he had already stated sufficient proofs of the sincere desire which the noble individual at the head of the ordnance had to make every reduction for the sake of economy that was consistent with the efficiency of the establishment over which he presided. Those petty clerks on whose pensions the hon. gentleman had animadverted, were not he believed, known even by name to the noble duke, who had granted them pensions on the recommendation of those who were acquainted with the nature of their services and their claims. He was completely at issue with the hon. gentleman on the construction of the act of parliament which the hon. gentleman had erro-

 Mr. R. Ward  rose, in consequence of the indisposition of his noble friend, to move the Ordnance Estimates. The right hon. gentleman began by stating, that although many persons were of opinion that our military establishment was too large, he was persuaded that it was not greater than the circumstances of the country demanded; The increase of expenditure in the department with which he was connected, amounted on the whole to 133,000 l., l., l., l., 806 l. l. l. l., l., l. l., l., l. l. l. s. d.
 Mr. R. Ward  certainly did not mean to go into a discussion on the great question of the 4½ per cent duties, and their proper application: it was a question on which great difference of opinion existed; but it had recently been debated in both Houses of Parliament, and the majorities had declared themselves of the opinion which was now acted on by government. But in steering clear of discussion he said distinctly that the hon. gentleman had proceeded on  ex parte
 Mr. Creevey  said, an extraordinary answer had been made to an objection which he felt an interest in, as it was similar to one which he was about to make. When it was objected that a sum should not be voted for Gibraltar because there were other means of supplying that expense than by a vote of parliament, it was answered, that it should be made the subject of a separate motion, and this too in a committee of supply [Hear, hear!]. Now, he would not consent on the part of the people of England to pay for the repairs of forts at Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands. He would produce an act of the assembly of Barbadoes which provided for that express purpose without burthening the people of England. The hon. member then read the Act of the Assembly of Barbadoes of 1663, declaring that it was necessary for several purposes relating to the government of those colonies, and specially for "the reparation of the forts," that a competent revenue should be raised, and that for those purposes they granted a duty of 4½ per cent to be levied on all imports [[Hear!]. What, then, had they to do but to apply this revenue? He would prove that the revenue existed. There were papers before the House showing that the duties had produced 57,276 l. l. l. 817 l. 818
 Mr. W. Parnell  thought a system of protecting duties inconsistent with the sound principles of political economy, as hey could only be meant to force a manufacture. The duties alluded to had, however, existed in Ireland for 20 years, and if that period were not sufficient to afford the Irish manufacturers an opportunity of preparing for their repeal, what assurance was there that their further continuance, or that any proposed principle if gradual reduction, would have the effect which the right hon. gentleman professed to have in view?
 Sir Isaac Coffin  observed, that the statement of the petitioners was quite incorrect. Instead of the timber, as they alleged, being colonial, and which was imported into this country from Quebec, the fact was, that such timber was the growth of the north-west part of the province of New York. He had himself written to lord Bathurst on the subject, for such was the effect of that trade between our American colonies and the United States, that in the last war our colonies were wholly drained of silver. The sooner a duty was put on the importation of that timber the better. We had, by the preference given to that trade, lost a good customer in Russia and the other Northern States.
 Sir John Nicholl  opposed the clause as contrary to the principle of the Marriage act, which rendered inoperative marriages so contracted, with respect to all the parties. This proposal had, it seemed, been rejected last year, and he thought correctly.
 Sir John Nicholl  said, that he certainly had misunderstood the purport of the clause, but now comprehending its object distinctly, he entirely acquiesced in its propriety.
 Lord Milton  observed, that there was one circumstance respecting the office held by the noble marquis, to which no allusion had been made either that night or previously. It was well known that a judicial office had been held by his father, which usually enabled its holder to amass a large fortune. That office he had resigned; and it should alwa3's be remembered what the cause of that resignation was. It had taken place because he believed it necessary to the defence of the rights and liberties of his country—believing that to save a compromise of his principles, he was obliged to separate himself from the administration then in power. It was upon the question of the Middlesex election, that, differing in opinion from his colleagues, he had thought he could no longer retain the chancellorship. The recollection of this fact should endear the memory of the father, and secure for his descendant the respect and attention of the country.
 Lord Milton,  in reference to 11,000 discharged men that had been called out in the course of the last year, wished to know whether that was done without any vote of parliament. As far as he recollected, no vote had been agreed to on the subject. The number of the army on the 25th of March last exceeded, by 11,000 men, the number voted by the Mutiny bill in 1819. The number of men was stated annually in the preamble of the Mutiny bill, and these 11,000 men were arrayed when parliament was not sitting. No notice had been taken of this circumstance during the last session; at least no official notice. The noble lord might perhaps have mentioned it, incidentally, in his speech, but no vote of that House had taken place with reference to this subject. He could not conceive why it had been thus passed over.
 Lord Palmerston  replied, that there were no charges for infantry, and that it was the temporary and superseded character of the local militia which occasioned the expense now charged under that head. What were called skeleton waggons, were in perfect repair, and it would be against every principle of economy to sell or destroy them. The art of driving them was not to be acquired at once by a peasant or a ploughman. He thought Sandhurst preferable to Marlow for the situation of the military college. The commander-in-chief had had an increased allowance since 1814, but it was in lieu of other allowances previously given to field-marshals. The duke of Wellington got the same, the fluctuating allowances of field-marshals having been exchanged for a fixed sum. He then proceeded to defend the salary assigned to the judge-advocate, which he maintained was deserved by the services of that officer, who was in constant communication with the military commanders at Ceylon, the Cape, the Ionian islands, and also in Ireland, now that the office of judge advocate was abolished in that country. With respect to the observations which had been made on the Military College, they did not appear to him to be well founded; and really as to the calculations of the hon. gentleman regarding it, he confessed his inability to follow them. He maintained, that not more than a proper number of commissions had been granted to the cadets educated there, and those only upon a full conviction of the merit of those to
 838
 Lord Palmerston  again rose to bring forward the Army Estimates. He commenced by referring to particulars; and first to the staff, on which he said there was a total saving of 13,701 l. 822 l.; l., l., l. l.; l., l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l.; 823 l. l.; l., s. l., l., l., l., l. l.; l., 824 l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l., l., l., l., l. l.: l. l. 825
 Lord Palmerston  maintained, that, according to the argument of the noble lord, the Crown could not, in any emergency, however great, levy a number of men without the consent of parliament. If this were the case, in what a dangerous situation would the country be placed, if a foreign foe were to land in the country during a dissolution of parliament!
 Lord Palmerston  rose to move the Army Estimates. In proposing those estimates to the committee, he did not feel it necessary to go through an explanation of each particular item: he would confine himself chiefly to those in which there was any material variation from the charge of last year. The committee would perceive that there was this year an increase of force, amounting, including officers, to 11,745 men, making an increase of 220,000 l. l., l. l.; l. l. s. l. s. l.; l.; l., 805
 Mr. Marryat  presented a petition from the shipbuilders of the port of London, stating the distress under which they, and those dependent on them laboured. They were not enabled to give employment to the one-third of their former amount. It might be thought that they would be favourable to a remission of the duties on timber coming from the Baltic, as the timber would be cheaper; but they were not so. They had the good sense to see, that if that trade were opened, it must have the effect of destroying the trade with our North-American colonies, which they stated would be most injurious to our shipping trade. The petition, he observed, was signed by one of every respectable ship-building firm (with one exception) at both sides of the water, from one end of the river to the other.
 Sir W. Curtis  said, that if ever there was a body of British subjects entitled to the consideration and respect of parliament, it was the present petitioners.—During all the difficulties of the war, they had been ready to make every sacrifice for the safety and honour of the country. He hoped that no interference would be made with those navigation laws which had so essentially led to our maritime greatness.
 Mr. Marryat*  said: Mr. Speaker; I feel it my duty to bear testimony to the truth of the allegations contained in the petition now in the hands of my honourable friend the member for the city of London; and to give my best support to the prayer of the petitioners. They state that they are labouring under great and serious difficulties, as well from the depression of commerce, as from the competition of foreign ship owners; and the facts of the case unfortunately bear them out too well in the assertion; for no description of property has, I believe, been depreciated to j such an extent as that of the British ship owners. I admit, that on the breaking out of the late war, the value of shipping rose, the rate of freight advanced, and I that the ship owners, in common with the landholders, the manufacturers, and all other classes of the community, enjoyed for a time a considerable share of prosperity. Ships, however, are but of limited duration; they last from fifteen to twenty years, according to the goodness of the materials of which they are built. The

 Mr. Baring  said, that it was not intended on his part, or that of those with whom he concurred, to interfere with any part of our colonial policy, the timber trade alone excepted, and that nothing was farther from his purpose than to injure the interest of our shipping. There was, indeed, no class with whose interest he would be more unwilling to interfere, than that connected with our shipping. But when the whole question should be regularly brought before the House, after due and deliberate consideration by the committee for the appointment of which he proposed to move, without making any observation, after the present motion was disposed of, he would enter fully into the discussion of this subject.
 Mr. Davies Gilbert  said, that the case of Grampound was one which admitted of no justification, and it was impossible to deny that a system of corruption had for a long period of time existed in that borough, which called for the animadversion of the House. In considering, however, the remedy which it would be roost expedient to apply to an evil which was admitted on all hands to exist, he confessed himself unable to accede either to the proposition of the noble lord who

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  rose to move, that the farther discussion of this question be adjourned till to-morrow, alleging the absence of his majesty's ministers at a cabinet council, upon a subject of high importance, as the ground of this motion.
 Lord J. Russell  said, he was willing to accede to any arrangement which might accommodate the right hon. gentleman, but he fell that upon the present occasion he was scarcely at liberty to do so, without the concurrence of his hon. friend the member for Durham, whose motion upon the state of the representation stood for to-morrow.
 Lord John Russell,  in rising to move the order of the day for the committal of the bill upon this subject, stated, that he did not feel it necessary at present to occupy much of the attention of the House, as he had already so fully explained the nature and object of the bill. With respect to the question, whether the
 864
 Mr. R. Smith  spoke in favour of the bill, which he thought highly honourable to the public spirit, judgment, and perseverance of his noble friend. But the laudable object of the bill would, in his opinion, be lost if the right of election were not transferred from Grampound to some other district;—he meant to some great populous town, from which a direct representation in that House was really necessary. If such a representation had existed for the great towns in the North, he firmly believed that that quarter of the country would not have been agitated in the course of the last autumn. But he was an advocate for this bill from a solicitude to establish parliamentary reform, as well as from a desire to satisfy the public mind. In speaking of reform, he did by no means imply those wild theories which were advocated by the would-be-patriots, who had so much disturbed the country in the course of the last year, and who were in truth the worst enemies of real liberty. He wished also to be understood, that when he urged the propriety of satisfying the public mind, he meant the intelligent, well regulated opinion of the country, which had unanimously decided in favour of reform, and against which all the eloquence of the
 865
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that he had moved the adjournment of this debate, not from any considerations of personal convenience; but because their duty to their sovereign demanded the attendance of ministers in another place. It would be for the House to determine whether the debate should be adjourned till to-morrow, or to any other day.
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow  deprecated the idea of confining this measure merely to the extension of the right of voting to the hundreds adjoining Grampound, as such a proceeding must, among other exceptionable results, serve to give an undue right of voting to the freeholders of a particular district, and that too in a county which had the power of returning an amply sufficient number of members to that House. But upon what ground could the total disfranchisement be resisted? For, as to the precedents, where was the precedent to show such flagrant corruption as had existed in this borough, where no candidate dared even propose that the bribery oath should be administered? It was urged in objection to the proposal for transferring the right of election to Leeds, that there was no precedent for the creation of the right of voting by an act of parliament. But this allegation was an egregious mistake, as there were many such precedents. In Chester, in Durham, and in the Welsh counties for instance, the right of voting was created by different acts of parliament. With respect to the question, whether there should be four representatives for Yorkshire, or whether the right of electing two members should be conferred upon Leeds, he hoped the friends of this measure would not allow their strength to be weakened by any dissention upon such a question, but that all would unite in securing that which was most desirable, namely, the total and radical disfranchisement of Grampound.
 Mr. D. W. Harvey  objected to the expense of the measure, and contended that from the seventy bankrupt commissioners the offices of the commissioners contemplated by the bill might advantageously be filled up. He admitted that three commissioners were better than one. It would prevent any exercise of arbitrary power, by allowing an appeal from the decision of an individual commissioner to the judgment of the commissioners in court assembled. The great advantage, as he understood it, of the noble lord's proposition was, that there would be two examiners under the name of commissioners, who being employed in examining accounts in private, would leave to the chief commissioner the principal administration of the law.
 Mr. Sykes  said, he held in his hand a petition signed by a number of persons of property and character, in favour of a limited alteration in the representation of that House. The petitioners were the freeholders of the county of the town of Kingston-upon-Hull. Its freeholders, amounting in number to between six and seven hundred, considerable also in property, were not allowed to vote in the election of knights of the shire for the county of York, nor of burgesses for the town of Hull. Though freeholders, they were wholly unrepresented, while at Bristol and Southampton, which were counties within themselves, the freeholders were allowed to vote for the representatives of those places. The present petition had arisen out of the discussion on the Grampound case, and the petitioners prayed, in the event of the transference of the right of return from Gram pound to the two ridings of the county of York, that they may be permitted to vote at such election. He entirely concurred in the views of the petitioners, and considered such a principle of reform both safe and practicable. He took that opportunity of giving notice of his intention, either to ask for leave to bring in a bill to that effect, or of moving a clause with such a purport, to be embodied into the Grampound Disfranchisement Bill.
 Sir F. Ommanney  argued in favour of the appointment of three commissioners.
 Mr. Wrottesley  objected to the bill, on the ground that it would occasion two systems to be going on at the same time. The late bill was a grievous disappointment to the country; for it had turned out to be one of the most mischievous and demoralizing legislative measures that had ever been adopted. If, however, the bill were to be adopted, he was sure that three commissioners would be necessary to administer it, and he trusted that they would be able to remedy some of the evils of the late bill.
 General Gascoyne  presented a petition, which he said was very respectably signed by the merchants and ship owners of the town of Liverpool. It was different from the petition which he had lately the honour of presenting to the House. It was founded upon a report which had gone abroad of an intended alteration of the duties on timber coming from the Baltic. It pointed out the advantages to be derived from a continuance of the timber-trade to our American colonies, which among its other benefits occasioned a consumption of British manufactures which could not be expected from the Baltic, if we should renew the timber-trade with that quarter by lowering the duties. Such decrease of the duties would, they observed, not only be extremely injurious to the shipowners, but to the seamen now employed, and to those emigrants who had gone out to the Canadas.
 Mr. Abercromby  maintained, that the expense attendant on the measure would by no means be great, and that it would be most advantageously incurred. He agreed, that it was desirable to reduce the number of bankrupt commissioners, but he contended that the best way of doing so would be to adopt the present measure, which would so reduce the profits of the bankrupt commissioners, as speedily to diminish their number.
 Mr. Abercromby  observed, that the country was much indebted to the noble lord who had brought this measure before the House. The most essential part of the bill was, that there should be associated with the chief commissioner two commissioners who should examine accounts in private; and this he contended, was most desirable. In conclusion, he paid a
 869
 Mr. Lambton  said, that the House was called upon by the motion of the right hon. gentleman to postpone the debate upon a subject of considerable importance, but the right hon. gentleman had stated no public ground for that adjournment. He was aware that the right hon. gentleman and his colleagues felt themselves in a situation of some difficulty, in consequence of her majesty having embarked at Calais for this country, and that a cabinet council had been this day called upon the subject. This, however, was no ground for delaying the public business; and, though he had every wish to accommodate his noble friend, yet as his own motion upon parliamentary reform stood for to-morrow, he could not consent to the adjournment of this debate, unless some strong grounds for that measure were laid before the House.
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  took occasion to animadvert upon the practice which had of late crept into that House, of raising a discussion upon mere motions for presenting petitions. The House had been now about an hour and a half engaged in discussing the merits of a petition which was not yet laid on the table, and upon which of course the House was as yet incompetent to decide. Such a course of proceeding was obviously so irregular, whilst it interfered so much with the ordinary business of the House, that he hoped gentlemen would feel the impropriety of persevering in the practice.
 Mr. Denman  objected to the appointment of three commissioners instead of one. He said, he was averse, in general to the investing any man or body of men with arbitrary power, but such a measure as this could never be efficient, unless the absolute power of carrying its provisions into effect were lodged in a single hand. Three judges in different places would follow different rules and precedents, and decide upon different principles. He thought there should be no appeal in these cases if an appeal were permitted, there would be great risk of a perpetual disagreement among the three members, or it would become a mere mockery of justice, and nothing more than a mere formal decision of the same case before the same court. It was contended that if only one commissioner were appointed, it would be necessary to have examiners out of court; but he saw no such necessity, nor did the proceedings in insolvent cases involve any investigations which one judge was not fully competent to undertake. Unless creditors exerted themselves to bring the property of their debtors under the control of the court, no exertions on the part of the court would be sufficient for that purpose. Upon public grounds, too, the unnecessary multiplication of judicial and other offices, was a subject which ought to be watched with extreme jealousy, and he could not help thinking, that if the committee suffered this clause of the bill to pass, they would give an indirect sanction to a transaction, which was felt throughout the country to be a very gross job; he alluded to the recent appointment of a fifth baron of the exchequer in Scotland. He moved, therefore, that instead of the words, "three-commissioners," the words "one commissioner"' be substituted.
 Mr. Thomas Wilson  presented a similar petition from the ship-owners of the city of London. It was, he observed, most numerously and respectably signed. It was said, that the decrease of the duties on the Baltic timber was intended to conciliate the northern powers, and to increase our trade with them: but at a period like the present, with the enjoyment of the liberty of the press, and when our newspapers were circulated in all parts of Europs, those powers must see the situation in which this country was placed. They knew the amount of our national debt, and the deficiencies in our ways and means, and they could therefore have no reason to owe us a grudge for a duty on timber. It was not so offensive to them as the duty on foreign wool, which was imposed in the fifth year of peace. It was objected, that the relaxation of the duties on the Baltic timber would open a larger field for the exportation of our manufactures, but it should be recollected, that we obliged our colonies to deal with us exclusively, and they were enabled to do so, to a large extent, by means of this trade; but if we took our timber from the powers

 Sir Isaac Coffin  said, that fron his own knowledge he could assure the House that not a single emigrant in Canada was employed in cutting down the timber imported from America.
 Lord Castlereagh  presented the following Message from his majesty:
 "GEORGE R. "The king thinks it necessary, in con-
 871 "The king has felt the most anxious desire to avert the necessity of disclosures and discussions which must be as painful to his people as they can be to himself; but the step now taken by the queen leaves him no alternative. "The king has the fullest confidence that, in consequence of this communication, the House of Commons will adopt that course of proceeding, which the justice of the case, and the honour and dignity of his majesty's crown may require. "GEORGE R."
 Mr. Bennet  said:—Mr. Speaker, seeing no member near me disposed to put a question to the noble lord, and with a full persuasion of my own inablity, I still feel most anxious to know from him, whether a letter which has this day appeared in one of the public journals, and which purports to be the letter of lord Hutchinson * * "Mr. Brougham having humbly submitted to the queen, that he bad reason to believe that lord Hutchinson had brought over a proposition from the king to her majesty, the queen has been pleased to command Mr. Brougham to request lord Hutchinson to communicate any such proposition as soon as possible, in writing. The bearer of this (Count Vassali) will 872 l. l. wait to receive it from your lordship.—June 4th, 1820." To this letter lord Hutchinson sent a short note which stated that his lordship had no written proposals, but merely some scattered memoranda on scraps of paper. Mr. Brougham instantly sent the following reply to lord Hutchinson's note: "Mr. Brougham is commanded by the queen to express to lord Hutchinson her majesty's surprise at his lordship not being ready to state the terms of the proposition of which he is the bearer: but as lord Hutchinson is desirous of a few hours delay, her majesty will wait until five o'clock, in the expectation of receiving a commu- 873 l.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that he could not help admiring the peculiar temper un-
 nication from his lordship at that hour.—2 o'clock, June 4th, 1820." This letter was dated two o'clock on Sunday, and within a few minutes of the stipulated time, Mr. Brougham received the following letter from lord Hutchinson: "Sir;—In obedience to the commands of the queen I have to inform you, that I am not in possession of any proposition or propositions detailed in a specific form of words which I could lay before her majesty; but I can detail to you for her information the substance of many conversations held with lord Liverpool. His majesty's ministers propose that 50,000 l. 874 'shore.' I cannot conclude this letter without my humble though serious and sincere supplication, that her majesty will take these propositions into her most calm consideration, and not act with any hurry or precipitation on so important a subject. I hope that my advice will not be misinterpreted. I can have no possible interest which would induce me to give fallacious counsel to the queen. But let the event be what it may, I shall console myself with the reflection that I have performed a painful duty imposed upon me to the best of my judgment and conscience, and in a case, in the decision of which the king, the queen, the government, and the people of England, are materially interested. Having done so, I fear neither obloquy nor misrepresentation. I certainly should not have wished to have brought matters to so precipitate a conclusion, but it is her majesty's decision, and not mine. I am conscious that I have; performed my duty towards her with every possible degree of feeling and delicacy. I have been obliged to make use of your brother's hand, as I write with pain and difficulty, and the queen has refused to give any, even the shortest delay—I have the honour to be sir, with great regard, your most obedient humble servant, HUTCHINSON." As soon as this letter was read by the queen, Mr. Brougham, at her majesty's request, made the following answer in writing: "Mr. Brougham is commanded by the queen to acknowledge the receipt of lord Hutchinson's letter, and to inform his lordship, that it is quite impossible for her majesty to listen to such a proposition.—Five o'clock, June 4th, 1820." 875
 Mr. Calcraft  said, it had been his intention to make some observations on the present amount of our military establishment, which, if necessary at all, was, in his opinion, rendered necessary by the measures of government. This, however, would lead to a discussion of greater length than was desirable on the present occasion, and he should therefore defer the consideration of that topic to a future day. If no other opportunity were afforded, he should be driven to the necessity of submitting a substantive motion on the subject. New barracks were about to be built in all parts of the kingdom where none existed at present, and such an appearance of military government was about to be exhibited as had never before been presented in any country calling itself free.
 Colonel Davies  said, his impression was, that the act applied to all cases, both of superannuation and reduction.
 Mr. Calcraft  regretted that in the first year of the administration of the noble duke, so little attention had been paid to economy in the department over which he presided.
 Mr. Calcraft  disclaimed any personal motive in the comments which he had felt it his duty to make.
 Mr. Williams  thought this a case which loudly called for inquiry.
 Lord Archibald Hamilton  expressed his regret that a case of such importance should have been thrust upon the House—a case which required the most serious deliberation before any act should be done—before any resolution should be adopted. The queen had arrived in the metropolis of Great Britain; and how was she received? Not with the gratulations of the ministers of her husband; no, they had long prosecuted her with ignominy and with insult; they had caused her name to be erased from the Liturgy of the country, and they now brought forward what was tantamount to a charge, if not virtually an accusation against her. He had, therefore, taken the earliest opportunity of expressing his unbiassed sentiments on the subject, unconnected with, and uninfluenced by any person whatever. As
 878 879
 Mr. Brougham  said, that at the present moment he would not enter into the merits of the subject, even to the length at which his hon. and learned friend had entered upon them. Unhappily (and he said this unfeignedly)—unhappily, not merely for the illustrious parties concerned, but for this House, for parliament, and for the country, a resolution appeared to have been taken which rendered any longer silence upon the subject almost impossible. The time had at length arrived when all men would be called upon to make up their minds upon this most important question, and when his lips would be unsealed from that silence which he had hitherto observed. At the present moment he should only say, and he thought it but fair to give the noble lord the warning, that his majesty's government would not only have to perform the task, and to succeed in the task, of making out a strong case against the queen; but they would have another task to execute, foremost in situation and paramount in importance, as regarded their own justification—they

 Mr. Lambton  said, that when he had last night stated his determination to oppose the motion of adjournment, unless some public ground were laid before the House, he had no conception that a measure of such great importance was about to be submitted by his majesty's ministers to

 Mr. Hume  said, that since this subject had been discussed, on the moving of the ordnance estimates, he had referred to the act, and he regretted to say, that in section second there was a clause that might admit of the construction for which the right hon. gentleman had contended. He now begged to ask whether those pensions to which he had adverted in the committee of supply, and by which a retired allowance, amounting to one-half of their former salaries, had been granted to several persons, after a service of two, three, and four years, came under that clause of the act to which he had alluded r The object of the act was, in his opinion, to prevent pensions from being granted to individuals for less than ten years service, and he protested against any deviation from that principle, as tending to impose a great expense on the country.
 Mr. Hume  expressed a wish, that with a view to simplify the public accounts, which were in general scarcely intelligible at present, and to enable the House the more easily to judge where any expendi-
 884
 Mr. N. Calvert  moved for leave to bring in a bill for providing summary punishment for certain vexatious and malicious injuries. It was unfortunately a subject of just complaint that very great and wanton injuries were committed on young trees, plantations, gardens, &c, for which the present remedy at law was extremely dilatory and unequal. In moving to bring in such a bill, he was not at all entering upon an unusual way of proceeding; for there already existed statutes for the protection of timber-trees, banks, and dams of rivers, &c. Abroad, it was to be observed, that gardens, statues, and other articles of private property, as well ns trees loaded with fruit, and standing immediately by the road-side, were not subject to such malicious and vexatious injuries as those which the proposed bill would go to punish. But it was a mortifying reflection that there was no species of property in England which was exposed in public, that was not speedily injured or mutilated, from the common mile-

 Mr. R. Ward  observed, that he had

 Mr. Ward  contended, that although there was an excess of 133,000 l. l.
 Mr. Beaumont  did not consider the question put by his hon. friend at all calculated to throw any impediment in the progress of the course proposed by the noble lord. It appeared to him to be a very fair and reasonable question. From the want of an answer to it, and the evident disinclination of the noble lord to give it, it was evident that this extraordinary letter was genuine, but that his majesty's ministers were ashamed to own it [Hear, hear!].
 Mr. Creevey  said, that it was not only competent for any member to ask such questions as the hon. member for Shrewsbury had asked without giving notice of them, but also to make a motion to the same effect. So convinced was he of the propriety of the question put with so much feeling by his hon. friend, that had it not been put, it was his intention to have moved for the production of the papers connected with the late negotiation at St. Omer's, and he actually held in his hand a notice of a motion which he had drawn up with a view to obtain it. He implored the House to consider the situation in which they were placed. They had a message from the king, desiring them to interfere in his behalf. And why? Because her majesty the queen had set her foot in England [Hear!]—for that now appeared to be the chief ground of her offence [Hear!]. Indeed his majesty appeared to have the same objection to her being in the same country with him, which he formerly had to her being in the same drawing-room. In order, therefore, to promote his majesty's wishes, they first

 Mr. Denman  said, that it was not his intention at the present moment to enter into any discussion of this most important subject; for, both in a personal and constitutional view of the question, a fitter opportunity would probably hereafter occur. He confessed that he entertained some apprehension lest he should be betrayed into too strong an expression of those ardent feelings which the subject was calculated to excite, but which, however, gave him infinitely less alarm than the cold, calm, temperate manner in which a proposition of this nature had been brought forward by his majesty's ministers [Hear, hear!]—a proposition full of such weighty consequences to the illustrious individual and to the country. He could not trust himself to press this subject at the present moment; but in common justice to the illustrious individual, whose arrival in the country was greeted with an accusation founded upon paper and not upon witnesses, and which was to be referred, not to the ordinary tribunals of the country, but to a secret committee [Hear, hear!]—standing in the peculiar situation in which he did, he felt himself entitled to call upon the noble lord opposite to state distinctly, when he came down tomorrow to the re-consideration of this awful subject; what was the nature of the proceedings which it was intended to institute against her majesty?
 Mr. Sturges Bourne  observed, that by the act of the last session, which he had the honour to propose, it was expressly provided that Irish vagrants should be passed to Ireland without any punishment at all. They therefore had at present an exemption which was not granted to English vagrants. For any grievance to which the Irish paupers were still subject, he should be happy to assist the hon. member in framing a remedy. But the fact was this, that there was no officer in Ireland to receive those paupers upon their arrival in that country, or to whom an order for removal to their native place could be directed; and the want of such an officer was, he believed, the great cause of the hardship to which those poor beings were at present subject on their arrival in their own country.
 Mr. W. Parnell,  after an impressive appeal to the House upon the various hardships which Irish paupers were condemned to endure in their passage through this country, especially in returning to Ireland, observed, that scarcely a fourth of those who annually returned to Ireland were able to survive their sufferings. The hardships they underwent, which were but too often aggravated by the infliction of corporal punishment, were owing in a great measure to the manner in which their subsistence was provided for, that subsistence being paid for by the county, while the allowance to English paupers in their conveyance through the country was paid by the respective parishes. But the punishments inflicted upon the Irish paupers formed their greatest grievance, the lower order of English parish-officers, who charged those paupers as vagrants, being but too apt to consider Irishism as a crime. The hon. gentleman concluded with moving for the production of a copy of the correspondence between the seneschal of Belfast, and the chief secretary for Ireland, respecting paupers sent from England to Ireland.
 Mr. W. Parnell  observed, that it was not because there were many political economists or few paupers in Ireland, that there were no poor laws in that country, but the fact was, that while the poor were objects of regard and consideration in this country, they were, he was sorry to say, mere objects of contempt in Ireland.
 Sir Robert Wilson  assured the House that no motion had ever occasioned him more acute regret than that which had just been submitted to the consideration of the House; He trusted, however, that in the appeal which he was going to make to their generosity, he should meet with
 877
 Sir J. Newport  said, that he should vote for the motion, although he must must confess his inability to see any permanent remedy for the grievances alluded to, but that remedy which would be worse than the disease, namely, the introduction of the system of the poor laws into Ireland, than which nothing was more to be deprecated, especially in a country where the paupers were so numerous, while those able to pay poor's-rate were comparatively so few. But still he felt that some temporary remedy should be devised for the relief, as far as it was practicable, of the poor beings alluded to. But then how was that remedy to be found? It would be unfair to saddle exclusively upon those districts of the Irish coast which were immediately opposite to England, the maintenance or the expence of transferring all paupers who should go over from this country; and from what fund was this expence to be defrayed?—He felt with his hon friend the necessity of providing some remedy in this case, but still he conceived it a question of infinite difficulty to adjust.
 Sir, J. Newport  protested against the idea of delegating the functions of that House to any committee, or of allowing ministers to transfer to such committees their responsibility for the public accounts.
 Sir J. Newport  deprecated the idea of attributing any member's conduct to the influence of personal motives, or of supposing that to discuss the proceedings of a public officer, implied the existence of any personal zeal against that officer. It was absurd to maintain that the former services of the duke of Wellington, or of any other public man, should shield him from the responsibility which attached to any public office which he thought proper to accept.
 Sir J. Stewart  moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal so much of an act of the 39th of the late king, for the suppressing of the illicit distillation of spirits in Ireland, and the imposing of fines for offences of that nature on townlands and baronies, as directed grand juries to present off counties half the expenses of the extraordinary police establishment required under the provisions of the same act.
 Lord Mountcharles  expressed his readiness to assist in any bill for the getting rid of the military police introduced into many parts of Ireland by the existing excise laws. He adverted to the great number of informations for illicit distillation at the last assizes at Donegal; and was of opinion, that ministers were called upon to relieve Ireland from so great a burthen as was imposed on her by the present excise laws.
 Lord Castlereagh  expressed his persuasion, that in rising to call the attention of the House to the message which had just been read, and to propose that course of proceeding which it appeared proper to pursue, the House would readily perceive the great pain of the duty which devolved on him in introducing to their notice one of the most delicate, anxious, and momentous public questions that ever was agitated in parliament. And he could assure them, that if he and his colleagues were not confident that every consistent and practicable effort had been made on the part of government to avert the pain-

 Mr. Wynn  said, that after the manner in which the motion had been seconded, he should only say, that he believed it was a motion consonant with his feelings, and, he believed, with the feelings of every honest man in the country.
 983
 Mr. S. Wortley  said, that after what had taken place he had very little hope of any compromise; but as a great many members thought that the delay might produce a compromise, the House would do well to consider whether it ought not to make that small sacrifice.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he would not oppose the motion for delay. It marked the spirit which pervaded the House; and that spirit was the same in which, he trusted, it would be allowed ministers themselves had acted. He could not be responsible for the effect of the delay; indeed, it was his conviction that little could be expected from it; but he was not therefore the less disposed to bow to the wisdom of those who entertained a different opinion, and had expressed that opinion. It was not his intention to enter into dispute; but, if he had been disposed for controversy, provocation had not been wanting. If ever he had listened to a speech calculated to induce an individual to commit himself, it was the speech which had been delivered by the right hon. gentleman opposite; and there was one sentence in that speech, upon which he would try to draw down the indignation of the House. It had, by the right hon. gentleman, been made a reproach to ministers, that they had not counselled his majesty to take a different course from that which he had thought it proper upon this occasion to pursue. To what the sovereign

 Mr. Davenport  intreated ministers to consent to allow the House and the country time to pause, and to reflect on the important subject, by agreeing to the motion of an adjournment.
 Mr. Canning  declared, that as he had never risen to deliver his sentiments on a subject of so much delicacy and interest as that before the House, so had he never before been called upon to discharge a duty to himself so painful and embarrassing. The occasion out of which the necessity for performing this duty arose, and the circumstances connected with it, were of a nature as novel as they were delicate. He had listened with the greatest attention to the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down. In every syllable uttered by the hon. and learned gentleman respecting the mischief likely to result from the inquiry into which they were now unhappily forced, he entirely concurred. It was utterly impossible that such an inquiry should turn to the advantage of the country, or of the parties whom it immediately concerned. The dearest interests of the country, and the character of the most illustrious personages whom it contained were undoubtedly involved in the proceeding. But having said this, he must follow it by saying that from all that part of the hon. and learned gentleman's speech which went to impute to his majesty's ministers the responsibility of forcing on this inquiry, he utterly and wholly dissented. In taking up the challenge which the hon. and learned gentleman had thrown down on this subject last night, he was fully prepared to show not only that his majesty's ministers did not voluntarily come down to parliament to originate this inquiry as matter of choice, not only that they had not sought the occasion for it—not only that they had deprecated it with all their hearts—but, that they had interposed every possible expedient to prevent the occurrence of a calamity which they were anxious with all their power and all their means to avert. 951 952 953 954 l. l. l. 955 l. l.; 956 l. l. l.; 957 958 l. renounce 959 incognito 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969
 General Hart,  in seconding the motion, observed, that the excise officers of Ireland were now, by the existing laws, in-trusted with the management of a sort of extraordinary police. In consequence of the late acts to prevent illicit distillation, many districts of Ireland were reduced to

 Mr. Tierney  said, it was impossible that any man of good feelings could come to this question without the deepest anxiety. He thanked God, that he had nothing to do with the negotiations which seemed to have brought all the parties concerned in them into a piteous plight. All he knew of them was what he had picked up in the course of the discussion. If only the speech of the right hon. gentleman who had last spoken, had been uttered, he should have felt himself bound to say a few words, because without any negotiation at all, and without even any consciousness on his part, it had been proved by the right hon. gentleman, by an argument like the House that Jack Built, one thing drawing on another, that he who knew nothing about these negotiations, was the cause of every one of them; for that if it had not been for the clause which he had introduced into the bill of 1814, limiting the income of the then princess of Wales to the life of his late majesty, nothing of this kind could possibly have occurred. He begged leave to explain that circumstance. At that time it was proposed to give her majesty for life an income of 50,000 l. l. 974 l. l. 975 976 977 "Behold a proof of Irish sense, Here Irish wit is seen; When nothing's left that's worth defence, They build a magazine." 978 l. 979 ex parte 980 981

 Mr. Brougham  assured the House and the noble lord, that the noble lord himself could not have risen with greater pain than he did on the present occasion. That pain, however, was occasioned not by any reluctance to perform that which he felt to be his bounden duty, but from his consciousness of the importance of the interests entrusted to his care. The hour was now come when it was incumbent on him to defend those interests to the best of his ability, although under the consciousness of his inadequacy to so great a task. On such an occasion it was natural that he should feel an anxiety, painful on every consideration; whether he regarded the vital importance of the discussion to the illustrious individual most immediately concerned, to the dignity of that great family with which that illustrious individual was connected by blood and marriage, or to the interests of the community at large. Nor was it less important as it regarded the constitutional course of justice, and the character of parliament. To that parliament the illustrious lady to whom the present question referred, made her appeal. She courted not those mobs of which the noble lord had spoken. Her sagacity, not inferior to that of any person in public or private life, whom he had ever known, and the propriety of her mind, which, in spite of the calumnies which had been so industriously circulated, was not impaired by what was so generally ruinous to the delicacy of a female—absence from her family, where delicacy of character was best cherished—a removal from the country deprecated by her, but to which she felt it necessary to submit—and, above all, the withdrawing of that salutary control which more than any other cause established domestic habits, and was the best preserver of female propriety and delicacy—he repeated, that that sagacity and propriety with which nature had largely endowed her,

 Mr. Fowell Buxton  rose for the purpose of seconding a motion which, if adopted, would carry with it the blessings of the country. If the motion, on the contrary, were rejected, evils were impending over the country, of which no man, however wise, could foresee the termination, and which no man, however bold, could contemplate without apprehension. His majesty had condescended in this emergency to ask advice from parliament, and it was impossible that parliament could offer to the monarch any advice more salutary than to spare to himself, to the Crown, to that House, and to the morality, the delicacy, and the reputation of the whole country, disclosures at once so perilous and so painful as those with which the public ear was at the present moment threatened.
 Mr. R. Martin  said, that whilst he considered it an honour to be what was called a party-man, and had usually voted with ministers, he did not think this a question of party. He should therefore vote against the original question, and support the adjournment. It was his wish to notice a declaration made by a right hen. gentleman respecting the residence of the queen. He dissented from those who thought that such an adjustment was likely to take place as would render this country an agreeable residence for her majesty. He thought this a subject pregnant with mischief; and the best way to promote an amicable adjustment was, in his opinion, for the queen to remove from this country. Her majesty might remain at some near port, where she could have the means of communicating immediately with her legal advisers. But the longer she remained in London, the greater the danger was, and the more injurious it might prove to the country. He wished to know from a worthy alderman opposite (Wood), whether he had advised the queen in her present course of proceeding.
 Mr. Wilberforce  said, there was nothing but the absolute despair of any reconciliation or adjustment in this case, which would compel him to abandon the course which he now felt it his duty to adopt, with a view of preventing the dreadful discussions with which they were threatened. His hon. and learned friend had stated, that the proposition respecting the title of the queen, which had been made in a different sense from that which had been submitted to him, was the chief cause of the unfortunate termination of the negotiation. That alone was a powerful reason with him for thinking that an accommodation was not yet impossible. He could not help entertaining also some hopes, not only from the circumstance, that the present proceedings became in some degree necessary from the conclusion of the negotiation abroad, but also from the circumstance that the proceedings had commenced so soon after the arrival of the queen. He believed there was not a man in the House who did not participate in his feeling of wishing, if possible, to prevent the investigation from proceeding farther if it were possible; because if the step then recommended to them was once taken, retreat would be found impossible after it. If he discovered a spirit in the House likely to accede to such a suggestion, he would propose an adjournment of this question for a day or two, in order to see whether, through the instrumentality of common friends, some compromise might not take place between the two parties. On every account, such a measure would be desirable, and, amongst others, on account of the public
 982
 Sir E. Knatchbull  interacted his majesty's ministers to accede to the proposition. In so doing, they would give satisfaction to a large portion of the House, and to the country.
 Sir T. Acland  felt that his majesty's ministers would not pursue the line of conduct which had hitherto entitled them to the good opinion of the country, if they persevered in the motion which had been brought before the House. Precipitation might produce consequences the most alarming, and the postponement of the question could at least not be productive of any ill-effects. On what ac-
 984
 Mr. Gooch  said, he felt great delight on hearing the motion for an adjournment offered to the consideration of the House by the hon. member. A few days would not injure the consideration of the question, and he hoped that his majesty's ministers would consent to the delay.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  after adverting to several protecting duties which had been granted to various branches of Irish trade by the act of Union, and which would cease in the present year, declared it to be his intention
 1005 l.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  concurred with the general principles of the hon. gentleman, but he perceived that the hon. gentleman himself was not prepared to apply those principles to Ireland. The situation of Ireland was, indeed, very peculiar, as far
 1006
 Mr. J. Foster  observed, that the duties alluded to were protecting duties for England as well as for Ireland; and expressed a difference of opinion from his right hon. friend with respect to the duty upon coals.
 Mr. J. Foster  declared himself an advocate for the total removal of all obstacles to the commercial intercourse between England and Ireland. He thought that the custom-houses between the two countries should cease to exist—that the interchange of their productions and manufactures should be entirely uninterrupted—that, in a word, the passage across the Channel should be as free and unembarrassed as that from one town to another in either country. It was, indeed, most vexatious to think, that every man now passing from the one country to the other was liable to have, not only his portmanteau or trunks, but even his person and the clothes he were rigidly examined by custom-house officers. Such a system ought not to be allowed to exist.
 Mr. Tennyson  rose, pursuant to a notice he had given, to ask for leave to bring in a bill "for enabling Landlords more speedily to recover possession of Farms, unlawfully held over by Tenants," and he trusted the House would give him credit for being aware of the difficulties and embarrassments which surrounded him in approaching a subject, which had at different periods been ineffectually undertaken by persons infinitely more competent to the task than himself. Imputations of inconvenient delay, and of expense disproportioned to the object of litigation, had been frequently, and freely applied to the administration of the law in this country. There was some compensation, perhaps, in the diminution of suits, and the compromise of differences, necessarily consequent upon the unwillingness of parties to engage in dilatory and expensive proceedings, yet, in cases where an indisputable right existed on the one hand, which was fraudulently or forcibly withheld on the other, and where it was absolutely essential for the common purposes of substantial justice, between man and man, in the ordinary and unavoidable
 1001 1002 1003 1004
 Mr. Ricardo  considered those duties injurious to Ireland as well as to England, especially in the intercourse between the two countries.
 Mr. Ricardo  said, he was glad to see even that the time was to come when the country would rouse to those right principles, from which there never should have been any deviation; and hoped, that when the question of bounties with respect to linen, was brought forward, a proposition would be adopted to limit the existence of those bounties also to a certain period, as they were quite as objectionable, upon principle, as the duties referred to in the resolutions before the committee.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose for the purpose of moving that the order of the day for "referring the papers presented on Wednesday last to the House to a secret committee, to consider the matter thereof, and to report the same, with their observations thereupon, to the House," should be then read, in order to its being further adjourned till Monday next [Cries of Hear!]. In making that proposition to the House, he thought it right to state, that he made it in consequence of a proposition which had been received at a late hour that day
 1009
 Lord Castlereagh  disclaimed any intention of imputing improper delay to the hon. and learned gentleman or his client. He had merely mentioned the lateness of the hour at which the proposition had
 1010
 Mr. Wynn  observed, that one of the great advantages arising from the step which the House had taken on the night of the adjournment was this—that no one could suppose that the renewal of the negotiation, come from whichever party it might, was the result of any other feeling than a deference to the wishes of the House of Commons, re-echoed back to it as those wishes had been by every individual from one end of the country to the other [Cheers].
 Sir F. Ommanny  said, that such was the reduced state of the navy that he believed no naval officer in that House could go on board a common guard-ship and find men enough on board to man a boat in an officer-like manner. He thought the lords of the Admiralty had not discharged the duty which they owed to the country, in reducing the navy so low as they had done; and said, he was not one of those who believed that the continent was in such a state of security as to justify the dismantling of our army and navy.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the statement just made by the right hon. gentleman could not but interest the feelings of the House. He could not agree, however, with the right lion, gentleman as to the expediency of extending the limits which it had been deemed expedient to apply to the granting of pensions. Pensions had increased to so great
 1020
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that, upon its being considered that some further remuneration was due to this gentleman for the benefit which the navy had derived from his invention, a communication to that effect had been made to the Treasury by the first lord of the Admiralty. In consequence of that communication, it had been arranged that some provision should be made, by which his family would be benefitted, and he believed that this arrangement had since been carried into effect.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  stated, that he should not have occasion to trespass long on the attention of the committee, it having been generally understood, in consequence of a former arrangement, that he should defer any specific explanation of the finances of the present year until Friday next, when, on submitting to the House certain resolutions respecting the sinking fund and the loan, the supply, and the Ways and Means he would enter fully into the subject. All he had now to-do was, to state the terms of the loan that had been contracted for on the present day. In recommending its confirmation to parliament, he must observe that it was one of the most advantageous bargains ever concluded between the Treasury and the contractors. The price of stocks had this day coincided precisely with what it was when the loan was contracted for last year; and though last year there was an extraordinary degree of competition, the competition was still greater on the present occasion. The contract, in this instance, was a half per cent more favourable to the public than it was in the former year, although the price of the funds was in each case the same. The 3 per cent reduced annuities were now, as they were last year, at 69. The last price, before that stock was shut, was 70½ from which if they deducted the July dividend of 1½ per cent, it reduced it to 69, which was the present price—the same price even to a fraction, which the 3 per cent annuities bore last year. The contract for the loan of last year amounted to
 1023 s. l. s. s. s. l.
 Mr. Grenfell  expressed his approbation of the loan, which was undoubtedly very Favourable to the public. It was always an evidence of a beneficial contract when the premium was moderate. The right hon. gentleman was however mistaken when he said, that this was the most favourable loan that had ever been concluded. Other loans had been more favourable, with reference to the existing prices of the funds when they were contracted for.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  did not mean to refer to the present loan as the most favourable that had ever been concluded; but undoubtedly he considered it to be one of the most favourable. He had no recollection of a higher relative price of the funds except in one former year.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that, in the first place, he entirely con curred with the hon. member in applying the principle of competition to all con tracts for the public, wherever it could be safely introduced. There might, how ever, be cases where it would not be practicable to adopt the system. As a general principle it was a good one, and in a variety of instances it was adopted by government. With respect to the hon. member's remark relative to the advances made from the consolidated fund to the public service, the hon. member would understand the matter better by a reference to the 59th of Geo. 3rd, cap. 93, than from any explanation which he could give. He would, however, briefly answer the hon. member's observation. It had been a frequent complaint of different Members, in that House, that a great pro fit was made by the Bank, by holding in
 1026 l. l. l. l., l.; l., l., l., l.
 Mr. Grenfell  said, the right hon. gentleman would, he was sure, recollect that, in the commencement of the session in February, 1819, a question arose during the. discussion, relative to the Bank balances, whether the sum of 18,000,000 l. 1027 l., l., l. l. l.,
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the 2,600,000 l.
 Sir F. Ommaney  said, that if the hon. gentleman was acquainted with nautical matters, he would readily perceive that the necessity of having transport stations both at Portsmouth and at Cowes arose from the obvious circumstance, that the direction of the wind might be more favourable to embarkation at the one place than at the other. l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  denied that any violation of the act had taken place.
 Mr. Grenfell  said, it would be a most desirable thing if some means were devised to get rid of this deficiency of the consolidated fund. One objection to its continuance was, that it rendered the accounts so extremely complex, that he doubted much whether the right hon. gentleman himself understood them. He did not say this with any intention to offend the right hon. gentleman; but he did most positively know that many persons in official situations in the exchequer declared that they could not master them. When such men as his hon. friends, who had spoken in the course of this discussion, and who were in the habit of inspecting figures and accounts, stated that these accounts were unintelligible to them, something ought to be done to simplify them. The deficiency of the consolidated fund was a blot on the statement of their annual finance. It was clear that there was a deficit of from six to eight millions: he knew that that deficiency was provided for quarterly by the Bank; but it should be recollected that they paid the Bank interest for it. If they even paid a little more interest than they did to the Bank, in order to procure money to cover it completely, it would be advantageous to the public, since it would simplify the system. But if they did not raise the money by loan, and chose rather to issue exchequer-bills, still they would not be paying a greater interest than they now paid to the Bank. He was not sanguine enough to contemplate the period, within any moderate lapse of time, when the increase of the resources of this country would enable them to get rid of this deficiency. If the right hon. gentleman could state that in two or three years such an improvement was likely to take place as would be adequate to the expenditure, and also get rid of the deficiency of seven or eight millions, he would not be averse to giving him the full time.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, there was one point which might account for the hon. gentleman's observations, which was, that he did not really understand the mode in which the sum of 2,600,000 l. 1029 l. l.: l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, if that sum had not been advanced from the consolidated fund, the difference would be, that the Bank would have 2,600,000 l. l. l. l. s.
 Mr. Grenfell  rose, and, adverting to the 12,000,000 l. l. l., 1030 l.; l. l. l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, in reply, that he feared there would be much confusion in the supposed simplification of proceedings which had been suggested by hon. gentlemen.
 Mr. Alderman Heygate  believed, that during the war the loans would have been borrowed on worse terms if the public credit had not been kept up by the, sinking fund which had been established by Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, and ought to be held sacred. No delusion could now prevail upon the subject; for if its nominal amount had been stated at 17 millions, all classes in the country knew that it only consisted of five. With respect to loans, their result was evident. The present he conceived to have been contracted for on terms disadvantageous to the public; for it was done in a stock, the, nominal price of which was at a discount, of 30 per cent, and that price itself 14 or 15 per cent lower than the stock which, might have been created three years ago. It was most important for every man in the country, in whatever trade or profession, to know how the circulating medium
 1031
 Mr. Alderman Heygate  denied that he ever intended to say that the circulating medium would be reduced to the full amount of the loan; but he was at a loss to know by what channels it would be poured in again upon the public. He should be most happy to find his fears groundless, and that the circulating medium would be kept up; in which case the industry and the revenue of the country might revive.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he had listened with the greatest attention to the opinions expressed upon this topic from both sides of the House, and particularly from those gentlemen, who as representatives for Ireland were better able to understand the subject than he was. But he found so many jarring interests, and so many conflicting opinions, that he thought it better to take up the subject at a future day upon a general scale, than attempt to discuss minutely a point in which both opinions and interests were at variance. It was his most anxious wish to disembarrass the intercourse between both countries by the abolition of all impeding duties on both sides of the channel as soon as the state of the public revenue would permit. One of his first objects was, to open a free intercourse between the literature of both countries. Others would follow as they seemed most expedient and practicable; and he trusted that before the lapse of many years, those final arrangements so very desirable to every friend of both countries would be adopted.
 Mr. Ricardo  thought it quite unnecessary for the Bank of England to reduce its circulating medium any further than it? was at present reduced. The worthy alderman had said that gold was now at the Mint-price; perhaps he might have said that it was a little under it; for he knew that many persons took gold to the Mint at the. Mint-price, in order to have it coined; and this they could not do if gold was not, in fact, a little under that price, because some space, of time must, elapse
 1032 l.; l.
 Mr. Ricardo  observed, that on the 5th of July, 1819, there was a deficiency of 8,400,000 l. l.,
 Mr. Ricardo  observed, that the present loan was made on very satisfactory terms. It was impossible, he thought, that it could be obtained at a more favour-ablerate. He however traced those favourable terms to the recommendation of an bon. friend (Mr. Grenfell) who, some years ago, had advised that the commissioners of the national debt should be allowed to subscribe for the loan to the amount of the balances in their hands. This advice was followed on the present occasion; but if the old course had been adopted, and the loan had been for 17,000,000 l., 1024 l. l. s. s. l. 1025 l; l. l., l., l. l. l. l.
 Sir E. Harvey  said, that no officer in the civil department had ever done so much for the navy as sir R. Seppings.
 Mr. Tierney  hoped that the opposition speech which had been made on the other side the House would produce more effect than those which proceeded from the quarter in which he was standing; and he further hoped that the hon. member who made the opposition speech would follow up that measure by giving an opposition vote. If there were some branches of the naval service in which expenditure had been too profuse, there

 Mr. Brougham  said, that in the delicate situation in which both the noble lord and himself were placed, a superfluous was better than an imperfect explanation.
 Mr. Brougham  concurred with the noble lord in the import which he had given to his present motion. It was with a view to have matters kept for Monday in the same state as they were at present, or rather as they were on the last night of adjournment. To be explicit, he wished members to act as if every thing was in that state. He wished to add a few words regarding the delay which the noble lord seemed to insinuate to have taken place on his part. The noble lord had said, that certain propositions had not been received till so late an hour in the day that it was impossible to answer them before the meeting of the House. He would inform the noble lord of the reasons of that circumstance. The party from whom those propositions came thought it most important not to begin a negotiation, lest in beginning it she should appear to be making improper concessions, especially also as the other party, who did not commence any negotiation, stood in a situation not to be injured by making concessions. The strong and earnest remonstrances of her legal advisers had, however at a late hour in the day, overcome the reluctance which the illustrious individual in question felt to being the first to negociate [Hear!]; and he therefore trusted that the noble lord would feel convinced that there was no intention either on his part or on the part of his hon. and learned colleague, to take ministers by surprise in sending to the noble earl at a late hour in the day the communication which they had sent him [Hear, hear!].
 Mr. J. Martin  said, that at several different quarters there were seven or eight millions due on the consolidated fund; and yet the right hon. gentleman stated that he borrowed from it. By the act of parliament he could not borrow unless there was a surplus, and therefore he conceived that the statute had been violated.
 Mr. J. Smith  said, that it was his intention to persevere to a certain degree in the measures which he had proposed on a former occasion, and to bring forward either a bill or bills to correct the evils of the present system of the bankrupt laws. He was placed, however, in a situation which prevented him from bringing them forward at present. From a communication which he had received from the first legal authorities in the kingdom, he had learned that many of the evils to which he had called the attention of the House could be remedied by the authority of the lord-chancellor. He was likewise given to understand, that not only was that noble and learned personage willing to exercise that authority, but that he was even then engaged in drawing up the necessary orders to remedy them. He was well aware that the authority of that noble and learned personage could not remedy the whole of them; but he thought he should not be justified in bringing any specific plan before the House until he saw the orders of the noble lord, and the manner in which they met or avoided the present evils.
 Mr. Hume  observed, that, from the statement of the estimates which he held in his hand, he could not see that the saving in the estimates this year was so large as was stated. He was at a loss to know how such a saving as had been mentioned could be shown. There was a reduction in the total amount of salaries, but this was overbalanced by the excess in the half-pay and superannuations. In the very large items for build-
 1014 l.; l. l. 1015 l. l.; l. l.; l.; l.; l. 1016 l
 Mr. Hume  asked if it was proper that a transport board should be kept up at Portsmouth, at the expense of 477 l.; l. l; l.; 1021
 Mr. Hume  said, that the authority to borrow 6,000,000 l. l.
 Mr. Hume  understood the right hon. gentleman to have said, that he hoped this would be the last loan the country would require for a long time. But how could that be? Were these 12,000,000 l.
 Mr. Hume  observed, that if the worthy alderman would refer to former cases, he would find, that upon occasions when the heaviest loans had been borrowed to the amount of 20,000,000 l. l.
 Mr. Finlay  said, that as he saw an hon. gentleman in his place, who had paid great attention to the present system of Bankrupt Laws, he would take the opportunity of asking him whether he intended to bring forward again the alterations which he thought it advisable should be made in them.
 Sir G. Cockburn  explained the causes of the clerks not being raised to the rank of pursers. The number of them was considerable; and if the system of raising their rank was to continue, no end could be put to the number of persons who would require half-pay.
 Sir G. Warrender,  in reply to the first of the lion, gentleman's observations, observed, that Portsmouth and Cowes were necessary transport stations, as the embarkation of troops for foreign service generally took place at one of these ports, With respect to the remarks on the; charge for stationery, the excess under that head in the Victualling and Navy offices over the expense in the Admiralty office was occasioned by the greater number of ships' books, and other articles of the same description, which were required in the former. As far as he knew, however, no articles but such as were generally called stationery, were classed under that head.
 Sir H. Parnell  said, that in many cases that which was called a protecting duty was, in fact, a tax upon Ireland, particularly the duty of 10 per cent on British manufactured articles imported into Ireland.
 Sir H. Parnell  thought it would be of the highest importance to the interest of both countries to have the commerce of this country thrown open to the whole population of Ireland; and he should shortly call the attention of the House to the subject.
 Sir Isaac Coffin  said, that as an hon. and gallant officer had, for once, made an opposition speech, he would make a mi-material speech, and declare, that he thought his majesty's ministers had neglected nothing which could contribute to the happiness and security of the navy.
 Sir Joseph Yorke  observed, that nothing was more flat, stale, and unprofitable, than the generality of discussions in that House upon the expenditure of the public money, and especially with respect to the naval estimates of late years. His hon. friend who had just sat down, had stated that there was a reduction of 100,000 l. l. ║ 1012 l. l. 1013
 Sir Joseph Yorke  took that opportunity of asking the chancellor of the exchequer, if sir Robert Seppings had yet received the pension which parliament had recommended last year—he meant, had sir Robert actually touched the cash? He needed not remind the committee that Mr. Harrison, who had been one of the secretaries to the Treasury, had stood precisely in the same situation as sir R. Seppings, and had received a sum of 5,000 l.
 Sir M. Ridley  moved an amendment, that the grant should be reduced 2,000 l, l.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  said, he had no objection to the grant, and admitted that a reduction to the amount of 114,000 l.
 Sir John Newport  begged leave to suggest that the most speedy and effectual means of promoting the commercial intercourse between both countries was, to begin by an annual reduction of one per cent on the Custom-house duties of ten per cent between both countries recipro-
 1034
 Sir J. Newport  remarked, that some of the duties were extremely oppressive to Ireland and injurious to its commerce. Among the articles materially affected were those of books, pictures, and statues. The effect had almost extinguished the value of copy rights, and annihilated the trade of printing books. Through this, authors naturally sent their works to other parts of the empire; capital was in consequence withdrawn, and in proportion to the amount so withdrawn, the commerce of the country must be injured; he therefore wished the duties might be altogether repealed. The duty on coals was also most severely felt in many parts of the country; and was most injurious to the manufactures and to the poor. He wished these to be gradually diminished.
 Sir T. B. Martin  defended the superannuation allowances alluded to by his hon. friend, and as to the convicts, he stated, that when these people were idle and unemployed, scenes of tumult and vice perpetually prevailed among them, while, through employment, they were rendered industrious and regular. An allowance of 3 d.
 Sir T. B. Martin  said, that since the peace, 374 ships of war had been sold, and 178 broken up—a reduction almost equal to the number now remaining. He thought that ministers were open to a charge directly contrary to that which had been urged by the hon. member, and that they had been too hasty in diminishing the strength of our navy. We had now a formidable fleet ready to go to sea at a
 1017
 Sir T. B. Martin  bore testimony to the valuable saving of sir Robert Seppings. His services were beyond all pecuniary reward; and the benefit which the country had derived from those services, was incalculably greater than any sum which could be voted for them. He thought the pension had been too long delayed.
 Sir N. Calthurst  moved the second reading of the bill. He hoped there would be no objection to this motion as the me-
 1036
 Mr. Curwen  said, he had a petition most respectably signed by several hundred of the inhabitants of Cork, against the measure. This petition he should shortly present. In the mean time, he wished to state that the people of Hull were against the bill. The competition in the trifling branch of trade which was carried on between Hull and the Irish coast, was at present so great, there was little or nothing to be got by it at present; and the bill would render matters still worse. For his part, he considered the principle of the bill so objectionable, that no alterations that could, be made in the committee could make it at all palateable. He would therefore move, "that the bill be read a second time on that day three months."
 Mr. Curwen  consented to withdraw his amendment. The bill was read a second time, and, on the, motion of Mr. Boswell, the petitions against it were referred to the committee up stairs.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said a few inaudible words, after which
 Sir Francis Burdett  thought it extremely hard that the petitioner should be deprived of a remedy. The present evil arose out of the anomalous condition of the law. Persons were required to keep the peace, and were punished for not keeping it, though the government, by taking their arms from them, deprived them of the means of keeping it. It was the duty of government, while it punished men for not doing that which it disabled them from doing, to make up and provide a recompense for those losses, which were the consequences of their own new laws.
 Lord Castlereagh  said: I rise for the purpose of moving the order of the day for the further consideration of his majesty's message, with a view to its postponement until Friday next. In moving this adjournment, I trust the House will feel that it would be unbecoming in me to state any thing that has passed during the discussion, or to say a single word, as on the former occasion, as to the situation in which matters now stand. But I entreat hon. gentlemen to keep themselves and their impressions on the subject precisely in the same state, until a full explanation shall be given as to the position in which the great question may ultimately stand. In proposing to the House Friday next for the postponement of the order of the day, I mention it as the most convenient day. On Thursday his majesty's birth will be celebrated, and it has been usual for the House to adjourn upon that occasion, and I would rather take a later than an earlier period for the further discussion of this important matter. These successive adjournments ought to be viewed, not only as satisfactory to the House, but as material to the public interest, in order that the real state of the question may be made known as early as possible. Before I sit down, I have to beg the noble lord (J. Russell), further to defer the discussion of a question in which he is particularly concerned: any other day would be more convenient than the present, as it will be the duty of his majesty's servants to be in deliberation in the course of the evening. If the discussion to which I refer should be now brought on, I must therefore retire from it.
 Lord Castlereagh. —In the spirit of what has been just said, I may add, that this is a question on which all parties ought to say as little as possible; and I cannot give the House a stronger pledge of my feeling regarding it, than the determination I evinced to pass it over on the present occasion in complete silence. I am happy to hear what has been so properly stated by the hon. baronet and confirmed by the
 1041
 The Attorney General  was surprised that his hon. and learned friend should wish to discontinue a provision which had appeared in all former acts of this nature. Some cases ought at least to have been mentioned, as actually proving inconvenience to have arisen from the former state of the law. Had the commissioners, in the exercise of their discretion, ever been known to refuse indulgence to an honest man? If the law were altered, as it now applied to smugglers, be would venture to state, that the revenue would be defrauded with impunity, as it often happened that when the smuggler himself was not a man of property, individuals on the other side of the water would pay down sums of 700 l. l.
 Mr. Boswell  presented a petition from the ship owners and others of Ayrshire, earnestly entreating that the bill might not be passed into a law. The petition set forth, that the bill would impose an increased expense on coals imported from the county and neighbourhood of the petitioners; that there were already funds sufficient to meet the expenses; and that the proposed measure would affect the little commerce that remained between the coasts, most injuriously, especially the lime and coal trade.
 Mr. Bright  said, there were two descriptions of Crown debtors; one indebted
 1042
 Mr. Bright  proposed a clause for extending the benefit of the measure to Crown-debtors, as well as to other insolvent persons. He could not imagine any good reason why the former should be placed in a worse situation than the latter, or why the Crown should exercise the power of confining the person of its debtor, after he no longer possessed any property. He should therefore submit a clause, exempting Crown-debtors from; imprisonment, after a full disclosure, and a discharge of all claims beyond the sum of 200 l.
 Mr. Brougham. —I meant nothing, I can assure the House, offensive to any quarter, because I know that offers have I been made to her majesty which would have enabled her majesty to be better; accommodated—pecuniary offers to an unlimited amount, that the queen might be provided for in a much more suitable style. Thus many of the chances of disclosure to which I alluded might have been removed; but accidently her majesty was placed in a situation which rendered it more difficult, as I said, to prevent the access of indiscreet persons.
 Mr. Brougham  said:—I heartily concur in the recommendation of the noble lord, and of my hon. friend who last- spoke, in wishing to abstain from saying one word upon the progress of these transactions. I rise only to express my entire concurrence more particularly in the latter part of the worthy baronet's observations, and to make my most positive assertion, if is be required, that neither the illustrious personage for whom we are concerned, nor her legal advisers, entertain any other sentiment. It is our sincere desire that every thing should be concealed, or known only to the illustrious personage, and to us three, her majesty's legal advisers. If any other disclosure have taken place (though I have seen nothing disclosed, because I have seen nothing the least like the real state of the facts), it can only have been produced by some incredible degree of indiscretion or breach of confidence, for which no blame is attributable to my learned colleagues or myself, nor to the illustrious personage for whom we act; but it must in fairness be in part ascribed to a circumstance, I am sure, as unprecedented as all the rest of these transactions—that her majesty is placed in a situation which renders it difficult to prevent the access of indiscreet persons [Cheers].
 Sir James Graham  entered his solemn protest against the bill. From all that he had heard, and all that he had read, he was satisfied that the measure altogether was a most obnoxious and a most unjustifiable tax on the property and industry of those who had no right to pay it. He trusted it would be thoroughly sifted in the committee, and as he was anxious that it should be so sifted, he hoped his hon. friend (Mr. Curwen), would consent to withdraw his amendment.
 Mr. Peter Moore  presented a petition from Mr. Andrew Beckwith, who complained that, in the year 1817, his windows had

 Sir Charles Burrell  reported from the Committee appointed to try the merits of the Petition against the Callington Election reported, 1038
 The Speaker  observed, that though a petition, praying for pecuniary relief, ought to receive the sanction of the ministers of the Crown, yet that the rule should never be extended beyond' the strict necessity of the case; and here, though the hon. gentleman who presented the petition stated that he conceived that pecuniary aid was that which was required by this petition, yet the terms of the petition did not necessarily impose on the House so strict a construction [Hear, hear!].
 Sir Isaac Coffin  declared himself to be an enemy to all jobs, and such he conceived this bill to be. The people of White haven and its neighbourhood had already taken the alarm, and entertained a strong dislike to the measure; a paper containing some powerful objections to the bill had been put into his hands, and unless those objections could be upset in the committee, he should continue to say "No" to the measure.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  presented a petition from the inhabitants of the town of Galway, who complained of some abuses in the management of their corporation. He had no intention to found any motion on the petition at present, except to move that it do he on the table. He observed that the first sentence of the petition contained one of those lively expressions which, though so familiar to our neighbours, must always appear strange to the duller intellects of the inhabitants of Great Britain. The corporation was described as having been "incorporated by prescription."—Ordered to he on the table.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  said:—I rise to express the anxious hope I entertain that every individual, in the House and out of the-House, will so far forward the views of the noble lord, as rigidly to abstain from injuring the cause of either of the illustrious parties, or of the nation at large, by giving publicity to any documents or any correspondence, whether genuine or garbled, which may by possibility fall into their hands. I am sure that I need only mention the circumstance to the House; for every gentleman who hears me will be immediately convinced of the danger that must inevitably arise, from publications which can have only one effect, however unintentional—that of exciting prejudice against one party or the other.
 Sir N. Colthurst  entreated the hon. member not to take the sense of the House in that early stage of the bill. He hoped he would suffer it to go to a committee up stairs.
 Mr. Grenfell,  in moving for the printing of certain Bank of England accounts of the public balances, presented yesterday, said, that as there were possibly some members in that very select House, who were not members of the last parliament, and but little conversant with the subject, he begged leave to make one or two observations. Now that the principles, arrangements, and regulations, for which he had so strenuously contended, in common with other members, in the last parliament, were recognized and adopted, he trusted the warfare between the Bank of England and himself was over. When he said warfare, he used that word only in a political sense, for no feeling had ever entered his breast which was not founded upon public and political principles; he had never wished to interfere with the private transactions of the Bank of England, or to suggest any thing contrary to those principles of justice, liberality, and good faith which ought to regulate all transactions between that corporation and the public. It had been proved by documents for which he had at different times moved, that during a period of from ten to twelve years, the corporation of the Bank had been in undisturbed possession of public money, amounting upon aft average to a sum of eleven or twelve millions sterling. The interest upon that sum amounted to 575,000 l. 1047 l. l. l. l. 1048 l.
 Mr. Grenfell,  in explanation, maintained, that within the last twenty-two years
 1049 l. l.
 Mr. Wilson  denied that, because when the Bank possessed large balances of the public money they were enabled to make considerable profits from them, it followed that those profits were a loss to the public. The risk they ran, the extensive buildings they erected, and other considerations of a similar nature, entitled them to adequate remuneration. He was persuaded that the advantages enjoyed by any private banking-house were as great, and in some instances greater, than the advantages enjoyed by the Bank; and he was also convinced, from all he had observed, that the Bank were as anxious for the public good as for their own.
 Mr. Ricardo  conceived, that if it were true, as had been stated, that the Bank had made no larger profits in consequence of its connexion with government, and its retaining these balances than any private concern which might have held them would have made, it must have managed its own affairs very badly. The hon. director bad mentioned, as one of the great advantages which had accrued to the public from the acts of the Bank, the lending of a sum of money, without interest, to the government. But the thing was differently represented by the court of directors at the time. The Bank was then in this situation:—it had been allowed to increase the amount of its capital, instead of dividing a larger amount of profits among the proprietors—that is, instead of making a larger dividend it had been permitted to add to its capital: and the understanding was, that the loan of 3,000,000 l. 1050
 Mr. Peirse  said, that the hon. gentleman appeared to have forgotten the great advantages which the public had derived from the Bank in consequence of the advance of large sums of money without interest, or at very low interest. The balance of eleven millions and a half, to which the hon. gentleman had alluded, had been gradually reduced the year after to eight, seven, six, and at length to three millions and a half. In one transaction with the public, he alluded to the issuing of tokens, the Bank had lost no less than 700,000/. In the loan of three millions advanced by the Bank at three per cent, taking the difference between the current interest of five per cent, and that rate of interest, the advantage to the public was not less than 60,000/. a-year. He adverted to a letter of the late Mr. Perceval, in which that gentleman expressed the highest satisfaction at the liberal disposition of the court of directors. The whole annual sum which the Bank received from government, and out of which they had to pay all the expenses attendant on the management of the public business, was only 262,000 l.
 Mr. Baring  would not support the motion if he conceived it calculated to throw any obstacle in the way of any petitioners to that House; but, if he understood the object of the hon. and learned gentleman, it was to procure more attention to bills
 1051
 Mr. Western  conceived that the question was one of serious consideration, and ought to be sent to a committee.
 Mr. S. Bourne  did not mean to oppose the motion, as he had no objection to make the poor-laws more perfect than they were at present. The hon. member had, however, fallen into some mistakes. The Irish poor might obtain settlements by service, or by holding tenements of a certain rent. If greater facilities were not afforded to them for gaining settlements in this country, it must be admitted that it was no fault of his, as he had been disposed to bring in a bill that would have effected this, but the proposition had not met with the approbation of the House. He said, he knew of no law that authorised the arrest of a man in this country for being a pauper, and it was new to him to hear of carrying paupers to their home described to be transportation.
 Mr. Curwen  said, that no man could be removed from this country till after he had been examined before a magistrate. He, however, agreed that the Irish poor were at present exposed to great hardships, and was glad to hear a measure proposed, that had for its object the diminution of the evil.
 Mr. C. Grant  thought the subject one which merited inquiry.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  deeply regretted the distress to which the hon. gentleman had called his attention, but could not give that answer which he had desired to obtain. He was sure the House would feel the painful situation in which government was placed on the present occasion. To interfere in such cases was always a matter of great difficulty, and though the attention of government had been directed to the distress now felt in the South of Ireland, he was not prepared to give what the hon. member might consider a satisfactory answer.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  felt the deepest regret at the answer which the hon. member had just received from the chancellor of the exchequer. He concurred with the right hon. gentleman in admitting that extreme caution was necessary in such cases; he knew that interference on the part of parliament on such occasions was seldom thought advisable, and did not know that it had ever been called for on behalf of
 1054
 Lord Castlereagh,  agreeing with the remarks made by the hon. and, learned gentleman, as to the occasions on which a public tribute of applause should be rendered to those who were no more, perfectly entered into the feelings which had been expressed with respect to Mr. Grattan, and thought no individual could hesitate in awarding to his name the honours claimed for it. No man had ever rendered more splendid services to the country, than the individual whose loss was deplored both by the House and the country. He could remember when he (lord C.) first came into public life in 1790, that Mr. Grattan was there in the zenith of his talents, and certainly no talents had ever asserted greater supremacy over a popular assembly than his had done. He was of opinion, that in the great transaction which had been alluded to, England profited not less from the talents of Mr. Grattan than Ireland had done. By the victory which he bad previously gained, Mr. Grattan had laid the foundation for that measure which had united the two islands of Great Britain and Ireland into one empire, and dissipated those mists which had before prevented both countries from seeing their true interests, Mr. Grat-
 1061
 Mr. C. Grant  entreated the pardon of the House for occupying their attention for a few minutes on a subject which to him was so deeply interesting. He was glad that this occasion had not been allowed to pass, without paying that just tribute of panegyric to the memory of the late Mr. Grattan, because he thought it was due to the feelings of the House
 1062
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  trusted he might be permitted to occupy the House for a few moments, with the expression of those sentiments which were common to all who had ever known the revered individual whose loss the country had now to deplore. He was fully sensible that whatever might be said on the subject, might do honour to themselves and to the country; but could add no honour to the memory of such a man as Mr. Grattan. The hon. and learned gentleman who had introduced the topic to the House, had expatiated on the character of his illustrious friend with an eloquence and a feeling to which every breast responded. It had been truly said by the hon. and learned gentleman, that if they wished to read the history of M. Grattan, they must read the history of his country. With every memorable occurrence in Irish history during the last forty years, Mr. Grattan's name was connected; and he had stamped it with his character. It was superfluous to dilate on this subject. To Mr. Grattan's exertions, Ireland principally owed her independence. In his own words, the revolution then achieved was "alone in the history of empires, the revolution accomplished without shedding a drop of human
 1064
 Mr. Becher  declared his conviction that the House would make allowance for the feelings which must animate every Irish bosom on contemplating the qualities of the most distinguished and useful patriot that his country had ever produced. Without stopping for a moment to consider his own incapacity to address the House on such a subject, he should be ashamed to sit silently in any assembly where he had a right to deliver his sentiments, when the name, of Grattan was mentioned; and he was sure that his sentiments were in unison with those of all who heard him, when he expressed his deep lamentation for the loss, and his profound veneration and gratitude for the services of the illustrious individual in question. He by no means intended to enter into any detailed panegyric on
 1065 1066
 Mr. Williams  thought it was right to continue the protecting duties, when it appeared that manufactories were founded on the faith of them as existing laws; but he did not think it just that Ireland should pay a duty of 10 per cent for necessary commodities.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  begged leave to bring to the recollection of the House the nature of the proceedings which had already taken place on this subject. In the session before last it had been stated in the House, that a petition was coming over from Ireland, praying for a continuance of these protecting duties. On this occasion, he had been asked what were the intentions of government respecting them? when he replied, that government was clearly of opinion that they must cease some time or other, but that they had not then fixed the period for their abolition. Upon farther consideration of the subject, he had plainly foreseen that they could not cease without adequate notice being given, without causing great injury, and he had therefore brought in, his bill with respect to them, which had beep alluded to. He declared that he could not consent now to go an inquiry, which could do no good, and. would only serve to create alarm. If the House had thought it necessary, they might have allowed these duties to continue in their present state for one or two years longer, and then take them again into consideration, with a view to appoint a time for their final extinction. But even that course could not be adopted without great disadvantage; for so long as the manufacturer saw no specific mode pointed, out for the extinction of these duties, he would be inclined to think that they would continue for ever. He could not agree in the opinion of the hon. baronet that the plan was not an intelligible one. It had been approved by three gentlemen of considerable experience in the affairs of Ireland, who had filled the office of chancellor of the exchequer for that country. The measure was intended to benefit the nation at large. With respect to the articles referred to by the hon.
 1071
 Mr. Curwen  was for going into the inquiry, not for the purpose of repealing the existing duties, but with a view to ascertain the period to which it would be necessary to continue them.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that by the act of Union, the question of continuing or discontinuing these duties, was left entirely open. Now that parliament had evinced a disposition to act upon more enlarged principles of commerce, perhaps, if he had to consider whether he would for the first time propose such duties, he should not be willing to advise the adoption of them. But here they had to deal with duties already in existence; and even so, he would have no objection to go into an inquiry upon them, if it could be got through in the present session. But that was impossible. The argument of the hon. baronet, besides, applied only to two or three articles, whereas, the alarm which would be excited applied to the whole: and there never was a moment when it was more necessary to guard that country from all unnecessary alarm than the present, when commercial credit was so deeply shaken. No course could more directly tend to excite alarm than the course now proposed. With other injurious consequences it would produce a great deal of commercial jealousy.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  rose to oppose the motion. There was no one proposition, he said, which would produce a feeling half so fatal in Ireland as that of the hon. baronet. The state of Ireland at the pre sent moment was so deplorable, that any attempt to agitate this question would produce a feeling of a most distressing nature throughout the whole country; and he had not heard in the arguments of either of the hon. members any thing to induce him to agree to the motion. The hon. baronet said, that there, were many articles in schedule 2, which were not ma nufactured in Ireland; and he asked for a committee to inquire into that subject, forgetting, that the discussion on that point will come on in. the committee on the bill itself. The hon. baronet seemed to suppose, that the whole of the commodity of wrought iron was produced from England alone. There were, however, manufactories for that article in Ireland, and, although they might not perhaps appear considerable to the hon. member for Staffordshire, they were of great importance to the Irish people. He protested against the hon. baronet's construction of the union act. He contended that it was not intended by that act that these duties should cease at the end of twenty years; but at that time it should be competent for parliament to re-consider the subject. It was to prevent their going into an inquiry from which no good could be de rived, and to prevent the mischief which such a step would produce in Ireland in its present distressed state, that he objected to the motion.
 Colonel Davies  said, that he had been long of opinion that the country suffered under a military force, which it did not require, and that in the different departments of the army there was a shameful waste of expenditure. The hon. colonel next adverted to the public meetings held through the country, which were not, in the opinion of those who attended them, of an illegal description, and did not, at all events, require an increase of the army; for if the peace of the country were seriously threatened, he would much sooner depend upon the exertions of the gentry and the loyal and well-disposed part of the people, by far the most numerous body, than he would upon the dangerous and unconstitutional interference of military power. The actual force in 1819 was equal to all purposes of protection against foreign or domestic enemies. The only pretext for the increase of that force was, the extraordinary apathy of the people who had property to defend in the disturbed districts of England. In Scotland there were 7 or 8,000 volunteers and yeomanry. In Lancashire there were but 500 yeomanry, and not a single volunteer. If the great body of the people were really tainted with revolutionary principles, the addition even of 50,000 men to the military force would not subdue them, but would add fuel to the flame. The history of France and of Spain, and of every other country that had undergone a revolution, proved this. If, on the other hand, the mass of the people were well affected, they should be called on to defend themselves. He should suggest that, as the noble lord (Nugent)
 1083
 Mr. Habhouse  spoke as follows:—
 Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald  said, that though he was aware that a sense of duty actuated the hon. member who had just sat down in delivering his sentiments to the House; yet he could not help noticing some of the opinions of that hon. gentleman. He should not attempt to follow him through all his arguments, but he would beg leave to call the attention of the House to one sentence in which he had said, that he would vote for the disbanding of the army altogether. He would not quarrel with the conclusion arrived at by the hon. member because he was confident that the House would not be induced to ground a vote on it. He would call the attention of the House to the state of the country with which he was connected, and declare it to be his conviction, that unless some precaution was taken before the next session the force now in Ireland would be insufficient. He spoke of the western districts. He had been present at public meetings where unanimous applications had been made for additional troops. The majority of the people was not disaffected. The middling classes of the country and the proprietors were loyal, and opposed to every treasonable practice. Within the last two months peace was preserved in one county only by the introduction of one quarter of the troops which the hon. member had said, would be sufficient for
 1094
 Mr. Hobhouse  explained that he had said "at home."
 Mr. Martin,  of Galway, said, he would tell the hon. gentleman opposite the rea-
 1095
 Mr. Martin  was ready to bow to the authority of the Chair, but if those expressions were offensive to the House, he
 1096
 Mr. Martin  stated, that noting was farther from his intention than to say any thing offensive to the House, or to any of its members. He was most penitent, and asked ten thousand pardons.
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow  said, he had no objection to refer the matter to a committee, if the House thought proper.
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow  replied, that he had given notice of such a measure as this in the last session of the last parliament. The hon. member could not therefore say that the House were at all taken by surprise on this occasion. His object was for the benefit of those engaged in trade.
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow  rose, pursuant to notice, to propose that the House should adopt a new Standing Order, declaring that no bill for altering the regulations of any particular trade should be read a first time in that House until such bill had the sanction of the report of a select committee. He briefly set forth the advantages to be expected from adopting this proposition, and stated the chamber of commerce at Birmingham to have voted a petition praying for the adoption of such an arrangement. He then moved, "That no Bill regulating the conduct of any Trade, altering the Laws of Apprenticeship in relation to any particular business, affixing marks to designate the quality of any manufacture, prohibiting the manufacture of any species of commodity, or extending the term of any patent, shall be read a first time in this House, until a Select Committee shall have inquired into the expediency or inexpediency of the proposed regulations, and shall have reported to the House the result of such inquiries."
 Mr. Littleton  was glad to find such a measure introduced. It was not an uncommon thing to find bills passed in one session relating to trade?, without consulting those parties most interested, which it was found necessary to repeal in the next, in consequence of representations of their bad effects. If this measure was calculated to injure trade, how came it to have been prayed for by the chamber of commerce of Birmingham?
 Mr. Littleton  seconded the motion. He thought it was of the utmost importance that this subject should be investigated by a committee of that House. There were many branches of trade, which were exclusively confined to this country; for instance, the wrought iron, the Hardware and the potteries. Now, it would be of infinite advantage to the starving manufacturers, if the duties on those branches of our trade were removed in our intercourse with Ireland.
 General Hart  opposed the committee, on the ground of there not being time for the inquiry in the present session.
 Lord Nugent  rose to reply; when the Speaker observed, that the question before the House was, whether the numbers should stand as in the original clause, to which the noble lord had moved an amendment, which had been since followed by another. The noble lord could therefore only be heard in explanation. The question being put, "That 92,224 stand part of the question," the House divided: Ayes 101. Noes 46. The bill was then passed.
 Lord Nugent  wished to preface the observations he had to make in bringing forward the motion of which he had given notice, and which had for its object a diminution in the proposed amount of our military
 1073
 Lord Nugent  assured the House that it was far from his intention to detain them long in setting forth the grounds upon which he thought it his duty to submit his present proposition. He feared, indeed, that the motives by which he was actuated, and the principles to which he must of necessity refer, would make but a slight impression on the House. His proposition would certainly apply itself at once to the principle of the army estimates, and have no connexion with any of their details. The time and patience of the House would be wasted, if he were to indulge in declamation at the cool unhesitating manner in which so great a military establishment had been proposed at a moment of profound peace. He trusted that the jealousy manifested on former occasions by parliament, with reference to a standing army, had not gone entirely out of fashion. It would be melancholy, indeed, if such a change had taken place in the feelings and dispositions of the country. A. much better defence, he felt assured, might be relied on for our domestic peace than an immense regular army. Such a force, viewed with regard to the avowed purposes of its application, seemed, to his mind, worse than useless. Were they to be told by the ministers of the Crown that after five years of peace, and after all the provisions made with regard to the militia, and the additions made to the yeomanry, that any cause of dismay or alarm could justify the maintenance of so enormous an establishment? Such a measure was, in appearance at least, a large stride towards a military government. He looked in vain to any thing which had fallen from the noble secretary at war for an argument to justify this proceeding. All that the noble lord had urged was the notoriety of its necessity. For his own part, he meant not to impute any motives of a personal kind; but he must observe, that a plea of this nature was easily
 1074 1075 1076
 Mr. Bright  said, he could not, without considerable alarm, view the efforts that were making to increase the military force of the country, and he deeply regretted the diminution of that bulwark of their strength—the naval force—which had been so often and so successfully employed in asserting the rights of Great-Britain. It was his most anxious desire to place the military force within the smallest possible compass. The establishment of 1792 had been referred to by former committees of that House as sufficiently large for the service of the country in times of perfect peace; and, for his own part, he could not see anything in the situation of the country at present that called on them to extend the military force beyond what it was in 1792. It was true that discontent existed in the country—it was true that alarming scenes had been exhibited—ie was most true, that meetings had been assembled, whether legally or illegally he would not determine, but which, in the minds of the people, were undoubtedly considered legal. It was equally true that those who were thus assembled had been forcibly dispersed; but he demanded of the House whether these combined circumstances rendered this extraordinary establishment necessary? He believed, notwithstanding all that was re-

 Mr. Wrottesley  said, that the object of his motion was not substantially to interfere with the facilities of examining specifications, but to Introduce such a modification of them as would limit the privilege of examination to such persons as were
 1053
 Mr. Wrottesley  moved for leave to bring in>g bill to prevent the inconvenience arising from the too great facility of procuring copies of the specifications of Patents, enrolled by grantees of letters patent, for the sole and exclusive vending of manufactures within this realm.
 Mr. Mansfield  opposed the motion. The present moment was, he observed, a most unfavourable one for the introduction of such a measure—a moment when petitions were coming in from all quarters, complaining of distress, and praying for relief from the operation of certain restrictions affecting trade. If the House should entertain the motion, he hoped it would not be allowed to have a retrospective effect. But he looked upon the appointment of a committee for the introduction of a bill regulating trade, in some instances as vexatious, and causing unnecessary delay. If, therefore, the House would go with him, he would move the previous question.
 Mr. Hume  observed, that the motion was contrary to all sound and liberal views of commercial policy, and that instead of concealing the specifications, of patents, every possible facility ought the to given to render them public. The legislature ought never to lend it self to any measure which was calculated to prevent the diffusion of knowledge.
 Mr. Hume  said, that there were at least thirty or forty articles on which the duties might be modified. The intercourse between Ireland and England, would only be of real benefit to the latter country, when that intercourse should be free. It was from this freedom of intercourse established between England and Scotland that the latter had benefitted so materially since the union. As to the failures of the banks in Ireland, they really had
 1072
 Mr. Creevey,  though he would offer no observation upon the merits of the proposed order, yet, considering that a standing order was a most important subject, he did not wish to see it passed without due consideration.
 Colonel Bagwell  felt it his duty to call the attention of ministers and of the House to a calamity, greater, perhaps, than had ever fallen on any country before. Of fourteen banks in the South of Ireland, no fewer than eleven had stopped payment. The consequences were dreadful to contemplate, as the people were now absolutely reduced to a state of starvation. The food which the country people had been in the habit of bringing into the towns was now quite withdrawn. No supplies could therefore be obtained; for as no circulating medium remained, the country people knew that if they brought any food into the towns it must be seized upon by the populace without payment, as no means of paying were in their possession. He begged in the strongest manner to call on the chancellor of the exchequer, as he valued the very existence of a considerable portion of the population of Ireland, to give his attention to this subject, in the hope that he might elicit something from him of a consolatory nature, which might, in this most pressing emergency, be forwarded to Ireland by that day's post. He hoped he should hear from the right hon. gentleman not only that government were disposed to do something, but that measures had already been adopted to mitigate the evil.
 Mr. Smith  continued. He would not say that the army was maintained for the express purpose of subjugating the liberties of the country, but he would say what was perhaps as offensive that it had been kept up partly from habit. We had gradually been accustomed to 7 000, 18,000, 35,000, and 70,000 men. We had become accustomed to millions in finance, and thousands of men in the army. The taxes ground down every class in this country, and the greatest discontent arose from that cause. The interest of the national debt was the great enemy that caused distress and disaffection; that increased sedition, if not blasphemy in the country. The influence it gave to ministers was one reason for so large a standing army.
 Mr. W. Smith  said, that the reduction of the army, like the question of reform, was one of those points, the advantage of which was always admitted, though the time for adopting it never arrived. He did not like to hear the interests of the army spoken of in that House; for in that House they could not be said to have any interests as separated from the country at large. With respect to Ireland, it struck him, that no greater censure could be pronounced upon the system of government than what was implied in the necessity of a large military force to prevent insurrection and rebellion. Ireland had none of the marks of a well governed country, whose characteristics were a happy and a contented people. Unless different measures were adopted, they could govern that country only by the musket and the bayonet, and would find it a source of weakness instead of strength. He would not go the length of his hon. friend and vote for the abolition of the whole army. Our garrisons abroad must be maintained.
 Mr. Wilberforce  observed, that the great public services which had been rendered both to Ireland and to Great Britain by the eminent and lamented individual in question, had been well described by his hon. and learned friend. Having witnessed all the exertions of Mr. Grattan's political life, after his introduction into this country, he begged to be allowed to say a single word on the subject. He had never known a man whose patriotism and love for the constitution of his country seemed so completely to extinguish all private interests, and to induce him to look invariably and exclusively to the public good. His mind was of a character which enabled him completely to triumph over party feeling on all, questions of great public importances—He could not abstain from remarking,

 The Speaker  was sure the hon. member would thank him for giving him an opportunity of explaining that which he was convinced was not offensively meant, though it was most offensive to the House, and might be deemed so by one of its members.
 The Speaker  was satisfied that he needed only appeal to the hon. gentleman whether his observations in the first place had any thing to do with the subject before the House, and whether, in the second, they were consistent with order?
 Mr. Speaker; —In better times than the present this great national question would not be left to the feeble defence which I can pretend to afford to it. In the absence, however, of abler advocates, and representing, as I have the honour to do, a large portion of this enlightened metropolis, I shall offer a few arguments in behalf of that which I presume to consider the rights and liberties of my country, now menaced by the proposition of the noble secretary at war. The noble lord has told us, that the speech by which the noble mover of the reduction of the estimate introduced his amendment, was fit only for the hustings of Covent-garden or of Palace-yard. The noble lord, although living not far from these scenes, seems not to he aware that—thanks to the exertions of his colleague's,—the people are shut out from one of those arenas for discussion, and that the same salutary interference has left the other open only at stated times and seasons. The noble secretary has also told us, that the speech of the noble mover was calculated only for reformers—to this I will say, that

 Sir H. Parnell  said he rose to move for the appointment of a select committee, to inquire into the duties payable by the Act of Union, of ten per cent on British manufactures imported into Ireland, and on Irish manufactures imported into England. Such a committee was necessary, in consequence of the chancellor of the exchequer having brought in a bill to continue these duties for twenty years longer than the time prescribed by the Act of Union. This bill would seriously affect the interests of the British manufacturers, because it would continue a heavy tax upon their goods, and thereby diminish the demand for them in Ireland. It would also, by continuing this tax, injure the Irish consumers. The cause of distress in the manufacturing districts being a want of market, it was obvious, that this measure would be a great evil, by its effect in raising prices to the Irish consumer, and thus limiting the quantity he could otherwise purchase. If the import of English manufactures into Ireland was quite free, the use of them would be greatly extended; at present every one in Ireland paid twenty or thirty percent more for every article of manufacture than he would pay if there was no duty upon it; and 200,000 l. 1067 l. 1068 l. 1069
 Mr. W. Parnell  supported the motion.
 Sir H. Parnell  briefly replied. He said, that as a great difference of opinion existed, he should feel it to be his duty to take the sense of the House. He felt persuaded that the right hon. gentleman himself was disposed to make some alteration. He was convinced, that if a committee was appointed, they would, in eight or ten days, be enabled to make a' report, which might lead to a beneficial measure.
 Mr. Parnell  called the attention of the House to the distressing situation in which Irish paupers were placed by the practice of removing them from this country to any part of the, Irish coast. He proceeded to suggest a plan, by which he thought the evils to which those unfortunate persons were, exposed might be in a great degree remedied. He wished specific places to be named to which they were to be sent—notice to be given of their coming, and arrangements made for their reception when they arrived at the place of their destina-

 Sir James Mackintosh  rose to move, that the Speaker should issue his writ for the election of a citizen to serve in parliament for the city of Dublin, in room of the right hon. Henry Grattan, deceased. In the absence of his right hon. friend, the member for Waterford, who from some circumstances, found it impossible to attend, he had been requested to address a few words to the Chair on this most melancholy occasion. He could assure the House, that in acceding to the request which had been made to him, he felt the deepest sense of his own inability to do justice to that immortal name which must connect itself with all that he had to say, and he could with equal truth assure them, that by acceding to it on this occasion he by no means evinced a partiality for such proceedings in general. Far from approving of such a course being pursued in cases of an ordinary description, he was ready to admit that if the practice were extended beyond the very narrow limits within which it had been of late years con6ned—if friendship, or any other inadequate cause, should make such addresses degenerate into matters of course, he should most sincerely deplore the departure from our recent custom, and heartily wish to return to the modest silence of our forefathers. Indeed studied panegyric on the dead was not consistent with the general character and simple habits of Englishmen; it was a practice rather suited to an enslaved people than to a land of freemen, for those who were debarred from the manly exercises open to the natives of this country, and restrained to a few subjects might be expcted, in the absence of other themes on which they might dilate, to exhaust themselves in laboured orations and in worthless praise; Hitherto, in modern times, the House had preserved a very becoming temperament on these subjects, and such tributes had been limited to cases of recent death, where warm respect, admiration, and af-
 1055 1056 1057 1058 1059 1060 "Ne'er to those chambers where the mighty rest, "Since their foundation came a nobler guest; "Nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss convey'd, "A purer spirit, or more welcome shade."
 Sir N. Colthurst  hoped the chancellor of the exchequer would not accede to the motion. He knew it would be productive of considerable alarm and discontent in that part of the country with which he was connected. At a period like the present, when the public distresses of Ireland were so great from recent failures, it was of the utmost importance to avoid all subject of discontent or alarm.
 Sir H. Vivian  said, he was as great an enemy to a military despotism as the noble lord, but he thought it was the duty of government to protect the well-affected. When he considered the state of the public mind during the last autumn, and recollected the blasphemous and seditious publications that were disseminated, he could not but congratulate the country on the escape it had had. The hon. member then proceeded to describe the disaffected state of the population in the west of Scotland, where he had been employed on the staff. It was, he observed, almost impossible to describe the disaffection which existed in Glasgow and its vicinity, where the population amounted to 300,000 souls. They had forgotten their duty to their magistrates, to their ministers, and even to their God. In that part of the country there were not fewer than 25,000 men prepared in every respect, but that they wanted arms, to resist the constitutional authorities of the country; while there had been but two infantry regiments and one regiment of cavalry to oppose them. If the object which so many mischievous men had in view had been carried into effect, who could contemplate without horror the events that would have taken place? The yeomanry had undoubtedly come forward, and in the handsomest manner; but he could not help deprecating the employment of yeomanry corps to put down popular commotions. The unfortunate events at Greenock, he believed, would not have taken place if regular forces had been employed. In conjunction with regular forces yeomanry corps were good and useful; but when employed against
 1084
 Mr. Shaw  thought the hon. baronet had mistaken the opinions of the manufacturers in Ireland, at least sin Dublin, if he supposed that they did not feel great anxiety that the protecting duties should be continued. At the same time, he admitted that there were some articles on which the duties ought to be discontinued; but he was of opinion that they should be discontinued only according to the scale of gradual reduction which had' been proposed by his right hon. friend.
 Lord Althorp  supported the motion. He thought it a sure proof that the chancellor of the exchequer had introduced this measure in a careless manner, when it ap-
 1070
 Lord Althorp  thought that the proposed order would be a good one; but he agreed in the suggestion of sending it for consideration to a committee.
 Lord Palmerston  moved the third reading of the Mutiny bill.
 Lord Palmerston  said, the noble lord, in the course of his speech, had stated, that the motion he was about to propose, and some of the sentiments he was about to profess, would not, he feared, coincide with the feelings of many individuals in that House. After having heard the motion of the noble lord, and the accusations he had advanced against gentlemen on the ministerial side of the House, he believed it would be found that there were indeed very few individuals within those walls who would be disposed to concur with the noble lord in the view he had taken of the subject. The noble lord's argument might be divided into two parts; the one relating to the military establishment, setting aside the 11,000 veterans; the other respecting the measure adopted in calling them out. The noble lord said, that ministers had adduced no reason to prove why, in the present instance, an establishment founded on that of 1792 would not be sufficient; and he further observed, that a committee, in the year 1817, which certainly was one of commotion, had pointed out the establishment of 1792 as that which ought to be
 1079 1080 1081 1082
 Lord Palmerston  thought this question would be best answered by the resolution itself, which he therefore moved should be then read.
 Lord Binning  brought in a bill "to enable the East India Company to raise and maintain a Corps of Volunteer Infantry," and moved, that it be read a first time.
 Lord Binning  said, he feared it was not in his power, in that stage of the bill to give a full and satisfactory reason for the measure. The East India company considered it proper to have such a corps in that part of the town, and it was necessary to apply to parliament to enable them to carry that measure into effect.
 Lord Binning  denied that the affairs of the company were in the state described by the hon. gentleman.
 Mr. Bernal  did not see any disturbances existing to justify the raising of 4 or 500 men as volunteers in the heart of the metropolis. Without good grounds being offered to justify them, he would resist the measure.
 Lord Binning  could not help remarking, that the other night, when some allusion had been made to this subject, a gallant officer opposite had strongly called for the raising of volunteer corps in England, and his observations had been loudly cheered; yet the hon. gentleman now contended that they were quite unnecessary.
 Colonel Davies  did conceive, certainly, that the raising of such corps was the most constitutional increase which could be made to our military establishment, because it was an increase emanating from the people themselves; but, then, he contemplated that the standing army was to be reduced in proportion.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose for the
 1104
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  laid upon the table a variety of papers and documents relative to the state of commercial distress in Ireland. The right hon. gentleman observed, that in submitting, on a future occasion, a specific motion connected with these papers, he should feel it his duty to propose a measure of relief similar to those which had been adopted in the year 1793 and 1811 by parliament. In answer to a question which had been put to him the other night by an hon. member, he had replied, that it was not proposed by his majesty's government to lay before the House any proposition of this kind; and by any other answer he felt very sure that he should at the time have exceeded the intentions of government. But his majesty's ministers having since received, from a variety of quarters, very many and very urgent applications for relief, they felt it their duty no longer to permit the matter to remain in this state, nor by their silence to warrant an apprehension that the distresses of any part of the United Kingdom were unheeded by them. He would here briefly notice what were the intentions of government in laying this subject before the House, and, in particular, what proposition it meant to offer, with reference to those measures which the lord lieutenant of Ireland, acting upon his responsibility, and expecting the sanction of government, had adopted, in consideration of the great public distress which recent events had occasioned in Ireland. He would state what the principal of those measures were. The House would be aware, that in 1817 a bill was enacted for the application of a particular sum of money in the execution of public works in Ireland. A very considerable part of that sum remained unappropriated, to the extent of about 100,000 l. l. 1106 l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  admitted that the grant alluded to in Mr. Gregory's letter was made not for the purpose of relieving commercial distress, but of employing a certain sum upon the erection of public works. The House would feel that it was the duty of the lord lieutenant, and of the government here, to bring this subject as early as possible under the notice of parliament. The application of the money by the lord-lieutenant was certainly in some degree irregular, and the first object to which he should have to call the attention of the committee would be, the obtaining of a vote extending its sanction to the purposes to which the money had been so applied. Since the date of the petition, the House could not be ignorant that the most distressing and calamitous events had befallen Ireland; they could not be ignorant of the great depression under which commerce, and indeed every individual, laboured. He thought that they would immediately see the analogy between the present case and the measure brought in by Mr. Pitt in 1793: that was intended at the time to preserve the stability and circulation of the country banks. Under very peculiar circumstances Mr. Pitt, for the first time, made a similar application, by calling on
 1107 l. l. l. l. l. l. 1108
 Dr. Lushington  felt assured that the House would hear what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman with great regret. He had taken for his precedent what Mr. Pitt had thought fit to do in 1793. To the best of his recollection, Mr. Pitt, perceiving that the country bankers were in danger of stopping, and that the circulating medium in consequence would be greatly diminished, had determined to afford them assistance; but the right hon. gentleman seemed to have forgotten that that assistance had been given in consequence of the recent commencement of a war, and of the occurrence of other events which country bankers could not have anticipated. But in the present case the chancellor of the exchequer had not thought fit to state any of the circumstances that had led to the failures in question, and he (Dr. L.) protested against such a grant merely upon the grounds of commercial distress. He was somewhat surprised that nothing had been said by the chancellor of the exchequer regarding the distresses prevailing in the south-west of Scotland. It was clear that, in Ireland, the houses that had failed had over traded; they had entered into improper speculations, and when the day of reckoning arrived, they were not prepared to meet the demands upon them The consequence of this grant would therefore be, that mercantile and banking concerns generally would be induced to follow the example of the Irish houses, in the confidence that, if they failed, government would interfere in their behalf. He should, however, consent, though reluctantly, to the vote, because he was aware, that such was the state of distress in Ireland, particularly among the lower orders, that the most dreadful results might occur, if resort were not had to some measure of this description.
 Lord Castlereagh  congratuled his native country on the strong sympathy and participation which was felt in the House with reference to the unhappy distress that prevailed in it. He had always been persuaded that such was the partial feeling of parliament for Ireland. If such a proposition had been made with regard; to any part of England, it would have been viewed with considerable jealousy; but the resolution which been that night moved by his right hon. friend, had been received but with one solicitude by all sides and all parties—namely ah anxiety to do all that it was possible to do for Ireland, under her present circumstances of pressure He trusted that the measure, like other preceding measures of a similar description, would have a great practical operation although he allowed, with his right hon. friend behind him that the, moral effect of it would be very considerable. He was persuaded that every hon. member who, like himself, was a native of the sister country, must feel great gratitude to parliament for their prompt acquiescence in his right hon. friend's proposition.
 Mr. Grenfell  concurred with the noble; lord in what he had said regarding paper currency, and he was happy to add, that that system was now about to terminate. The object was not to relieve the merchants and hankers, but the suffering punctuation; as far as it was practicable; and if it were necessary that a communication should be made to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland before the present vote was carried into a law, he thought that much of the benefit would be destroyed by the delay.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the vote he had proposed was intended for the relief of the people of Ireland generally from the distress occasioned by recent failures, from whatever cause those failures might have arisen. With regard to delay, he agreed that it would be better to avoid it, and that the bill to be founded on the bill should be passed through all its stages without hesitation.
 Mr. Foster  said, that the object of the grant was, to stop the progress of the evil and not to encourage speculation. The necessity of an immediate remedy was obvious from the fact that eight banks had failed in the south-west of Ireland; and if the failures reached Dublin, it was probable that they would also extend north-ward, and materially injure the linen I trade, now conducted through the medium of paper, but formerly depending upon gold alone. Only yesterday, advice was I received of the stoppage of one Dublin bank connected with the north of Ireland; and the consequence had been a heavy run upon the most firmly established1 banks of that city. They had been able
 1110
 Mr. C. Grant,  after what had been so ably and feelingly stated on this subject, did not consider it necessary to trouble the committee with many words upon it. The object of the proposition was not to relieve the innocent and unfortunate sufferers. If such a measure could be accomplished, he was sure the House would do it by acclamation. But that was impossible; and all that could be done was, by circuitous means, to endeavour to obviate the extension of the evil. It was impossible for him, however, to advert to the distresses which so unhappily prevailed in the South of Ireland, without at the same time adverting to the temper and patience with which those distresses had been borne. Destitute as the inferior classes of the population were of the means of obtaining either employment or food, there was nevertheless no example among them (except in one trifling instance) of any resort to improper modes of relief. He wished further to say, that although he entirely agreed with his right hon. friend in the expediency of proceeding with the utmost dispatch in affording ail the relief that could be afforded, the purpose of the grant had been, to a certain extent, anticipated by the lord lieutenant, who had, on his own responsibility, issued 100,000 l.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  expressed the high satisfaction which lie felt at the proposition; and concurred with his right hon. friend near him in pressing on the House the immense importance of accelerating its execution, as he considered it to be pregnant with as much moral as practical advantage. When the people of Ireland saw that government and parliament had taken up the business as they had done, he did hope that a great deal of the; immediate pressure would be diminished. If the learned doctor who had given a reluctant consent to the measure knew but a tenth part of the distresses that existed, and of the way in which they were submitted to, he would not have qualified his concurrence in the proposition as he had done. He begged leave to suggest to his right hon. friend the consideration, whe-
 1111
 Mr. C. Grant,  adverting to what had just fallen from his right hon. friend, said he had been authorized by his majesty's government to write to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, which he had that night done, to assure him that he might take such measures as were calculated to meet the evil, in the full confidence that they would receive the sanction of parliament;
 Mr. Bennet  deemed it right to call the attention of the committee to the amount of this vote, and the circumstances attending By the new schedule presented
 1113 l. l. 1114
 Colonel Davies  supported the opinion of Mr. Bennet. He observed that in 1818 the whole amount of the barrack expenditure was 99,000 l., l. l. l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he could assure the committee that the increase of the barrack expenditure was no voluntary act of his majesty's govern-
 1116
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  in explanation, said, that the hon., and learned member had misunderstood him. What he said was, and lie did not hesitate again to avow it, that such was the state of some of the population in the metropolis and in several oilier districts, that it became necessary, in order to protect the property of the industrious well-meaning, to establish barracks and keep troops in those disturbed districts.
 Colonel Davies  said, that in mentioning temporary barracks, he did not allude to old stores or other buildings. If it were found necessary to erect barracks for a time, they might be built of wood. This would be a sufficiently strong, and a much cheaper mode of erecting barracks, than by erecting them of stone.
 Mr. Calcraft  said, he had understood the right hon. gentleman in the same way as his hon. and learned friend, and that he had actually put the merits of this question upon the general and notorious disaffection of the people. It was evidently the system of the government in this country that had created the discontent and dissatisfaction which the right hon. gentleman acknowledged to exist, and which he stated as the groundwork that rendered the erection of barracks necessary. He conceived that ministers did not look into their own measures with a scrutinizing eye. If they did, they would there trace the causes of that alienation of public feeling, and of that general discontent, of which they complained. The present was a very large question, and, if pursued, would lead them into a debate on the general state of the country. He had no hesitation in saying, that if, when the repre-
 1120 l. l.
 Mr. Calcraft  hoped the hon. gentleman would forgive him if he said that, when members of the House of Commons were about to vote the money of the people, they had a right to make such observations as they might think fit. They were sent to the House for that purpose. They were called on to canvass every proposition brought before them. When money was demanded, it was their duty to call on the chancellor of the exchequer to state his reasons for requiring it, and in return, to acquaint him with their views on the subject. The hon. gentleman certainly was not so much in the habit of objecting to votes of money as individuals on his side of the House were; but that circumstance, however they might regret it, would not render them less vigilant. With respect to a question, as to the difference of expense for building the barracks at Leeds and at Glasgow, no answer had been returned to it; and, as a member of the House of Commons, he conceived that he had a right to have that circumstance explained.
 Dr. Lushington  said, he believed the House was ignorant of the manner in which this sum was incurred by the government of the country. He would state how those captures originated; they were made in consequence of the neglect and ignorance of the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty, and of his colleagues. He stated this openly, and he was prepared to prove it. He was prepared to show that the instructions sent out by the Admiralty were, from the beginning to the end, illegal. He was sure no hon. gentleman would for one moment sanction them, if they were brought under consideration. He was therefore to presume that those instructions had been sent out by the Admiralty without those persons at the head of that department knowing what they contained, or what would be the effect of them. He would appeal to one act of the noble lord opposite; if the noble lord would but recollect the circumstance, he had no doubt but that the noble lord would bear testimony to what he said. The instructions in question were sent out to the different cruisers from the Admiralty, and were, as they ought to have been, acted on by the commanders of those cruisers, for he would ever contend that it was the duty of the masters of cruisers, upon receiving instructions from the Admiralty, to obey them. Under those instructions vessels belonging to Spain and Portugal were captured—and captured, in violation of every principle of the law of nations. Though an advocate for the abolition of the slave trade, he must condemn, an act which went to overturn every principle of the law of nations observed in this country from the earliest ages down to the present day. Those illegal instructions were executed as soon as they were received; great alarm followed; a number of Portuguese vessels were brought into the different ports of the coasts of Africa, and condemned in the most unmerciful manner. But instructions subsequently issued by the noble lord opposite, revoking the instructions previously issued, and containing fresh orders, saying
 1126
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the expenses of the coronation would be brought under the consideration of the House.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  replied, that they would be submitted to the House as soon as the privy council should determine the amount of the expense which they might consider likely to accompany the coronation.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  replied, that it certainly would.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that however the hon. gentleman might object to them, grants of this description were also recognized by parliament, were always accounted for, and were necessary under the circumstances of the country.
 Mr. Bennet  said, that many of the persons relieved were juvenile convicts, whose previous character or whose parentage made it desirable that they should not be sent to the hulks. Government having thrown this charge on this society, they were bound to take part of the burthen. The change made in the character of convicts sent thither was a proof of the judiciousness of this arrangement.
 Dr. Lushington  said, the institution saved the country a very considerable sum; a number of young persons convicted of petty Grimes, and sentenced to slight punishments, were received into the establishment; but no funds could withstand the constant demands that were made upon it; many persons who were actually starving, though recommended by magistrates, were reluctantly turned from the doors of the institution. The progress of juvenile delinquency in the metropolis was very great; and as the Refuge could not receive all the objects that presented themselves, he would beg to suggest to ministers, that they ought to form some place under their own direction, where those persons might be received; for, if left loose upon society, it would be only to spread vice and crime.
 Mr. Bennet  deprecated the tone of scorn in which the last speaker had expressed himself relative to this establishment. He should like to know what that hon. gentleman would wish to have done to the unfortunate individuals in that prison.—Were they to be left to starve? There was this difference between them and paupers in the poor-house—the pauper could leave his residence, but the convict could not leave his, being placed in it contrary to his own will. He was not for pampering the palate of a convict, but he was for allowing him that quantity of provisions which was requisite to his support. He was fully convinced of the truth of an observation of the immortal Howard,
 1131
 Mr. Hobhouse  objected to this grant, on the very grounds which the right hon. gentleman had stated in explanation of its amount. He objected to it because the money which this grant was to cover, had been expended in the prosecution of political opinions. Those who thought that the recent prosecutions had been instituted without reason—and he was one who presumed to entertain that opinion—were hound to oppose the grant; whereas, those who entertained a different opinion, in all probability would support it. By making grants to so large an amount for such purposes, they enabled the Crown to fee all the talent of the country—he meant all the legal talent—to oppose the people. Briefs had sometimes been delivered on the part of the Crown to all the leading counsel on a circuit, so that an unfortunate defendant was often deprived, by such means, of the aid of eminent counsel. They would be doing an improper thing, as the representatives of the people of England—if indeed that House were the representatives of the people ["Order, order,"]—should
 1134
 Mr. Hobhouse  said, that those who thought the late prosecutions necessary, would, no doubt, vote for the sum; but he was not responsible for the opinions expressed by gentlemen in the last parliament: he was not to be bound by what had been said by gentlemen on that side of the House on the occasion alluded to
 1135
 Dr. Lushington  observed, that the attorney and solicitor generals received fees upon Crown prosecutions, because they were responsible for such proceedings. But he felt that it was only in cases where such responsibility properly attached, and where they were actually consulted by government, that such fees should be given. He had known himself, of cases in which the attorney and solicitor generals had received fees without being at all concerned; in Doctors Commons for instance.
 Lord A. Hamilton  saw no reason, in

 Mr. Arbuthnot  said, that before his majesty's ministers had come to a determination to erect new barracks in the proposed districts, they had made every necessary inquiry on the subject, the result
 1118
 Mr. Arbuthnot,  in reference to the mode in which the present estimates were framed, said they had been drawn up by a very accurate and intelligent individual, with whose merits, he believed, the hon. gentleman was well acquainted. Next year they would be presented separately. As to the cause of the, extension of these estimates, he agreed with the hon. gentleman, that was the consequence of the additional number of troops which it had been found necessary to embody. one item of increase, to the amount of 25,000 l. l., l.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  said, that the barrack estimate for Ireland was always brought forwardby the chief-secretary for that country. Of course the chief-secretary for Ireland would introduce the charge in the services for the year.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  believed that the inha-
 1124
 Mr. Arbuthnot  said, with reference to the sum charged for repairs, that it was Impossible to have a large range of barracks, without incurring a great expense every year for keeping them in a proper state. If the barracks had been originally constructed in a solid manner, such sums would not be necessary for repairs; but many of them were formed of wood, and were very much decayed.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  said, the two sums of 2,000 l., l.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  attributed the increase in the law charges to the disturbed state of the nation, and the expenses which had been necessarily incurred in summoning and maintaining witnesses to support the various prosecutions which had arisen out of it. The solicitor of the treasury could not state what the exact amount of those expenses would be, but thought that a grant of 40,000 l.
 Mr. Arbuthnot,  in moving "that 25,000 l. l. l.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  stated, that in this, as in many other cases, the actual expense had been found to exceed the estimates which had been made of them. Here the excess amounted to 30,000 l.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  said, that if the House thought fit, he would propose that the whole sum of 60,000 l.
 Mr. Arbuthnot  said, that the three secretaries of state were responsible on oath for the money expended. It was impossible for him to say how the money was to

 Mr. D. W. Harvey  said, that grants for secret service money were always the largest in those years when general elections took place.
 Mr. D. W. Harvey  said, that it was quite correct, that the attorney and solicitor-generals were in the habit of receiving fees upon Crown prosecutions, whether they attended or not. It was within his own knowledge that such was the case with regard to no less than 760 prosecutions in the court of exchequer in the course of the last year, upon each of which prosecutions the attorney and solicitor-generals received ten guineas each, although neither ever attended in any one instance. There was another statement also from the hon. member for Westminster, which was perfectly true. He meant, that upon a barrister s acquiring a high character for talent, the Crown was forward to retain him on its side by the grant of a silk gown; and it was notorious, that if a person prosecuted by the Crown desired the assistance of any king's counsel, he could not obtain that assistance without paying eight or ten guineas for a licence, or dispensation from the Crown, allowing such barrister to plead for him; so that here was a sum which the prosecuted person must pay in addition to the usual fee, in order to secure the support of an advocate so unnecessarily, and he would add, so improperly retained by the Crown in the first instance. This was a system which evidently called for some revision. With respect to the expense of Crown prosecutions within the last year, he was glad to understand that there was no objection on the other side to lay before the House some accounts illustrative of the items and character of that expense, and he hoped for the speedy production of those accounts.
 Mr. D. W. Harvey  wished to know the reason why such an increase of expenditure had taken place in this item. Last year the law charges did not amount to more than 20,000 l. l., l.
 Mr. Ricardo  said, that the difficulty of obtaining admission into the Penitentiary was so great, that he himself, though a member of parliament, had not been able to inspect it.
 Mr. Ricardo  thought that the difficulty of getting admittance into the prison ought to be taken into the consideration of the committee. If the officers were under the inspection of the public, they would be more likely to do their duty; and he could see no good reason why the prisons should not be subject to the inspection of the public.
 Mr. Holford  thought he could satisfy the hon. gentleman that the difficulty of which he complained was nothing more than a due caution on the part of the governors of the Penitentiary. If the public at large were allowed free ingress into it, it was clear that accomplices of the prisoners might gain admission, and thus counteract all the good purposes which the establishment was intended to effect. Any person of respectable appearance might gain a ticket of admission by application to the secretary of state; but if all were admitted who desired to have admis-
 1132
 Mr. Holford  said, that at present there were 400 penitents within its walls; by that time next year he hoped there would be 700. The number of criminals convicted annually exceeded that number; and the Penitentiary was built to hold 1,000. They had sent out of it, within the last year, 30 individuals, who, he was confident, would never again have occasion to visit it.
 Mr. Holford  said, the Penitentiary had not and would not cost 600,000 l. l. l. l.
 Mr. Holford  had great satisfaction in informing the hon. gentleman, that the steam-engine had not been erected, and that all intention of erecting it had been abandoned. Instead of a steam engine, four machines had been purchased for the Penitentiary, two for the drawing of water, and two for the grinding of flour.
 Mr. Tierney  observed, that, now it was understood from the noble lord that there was to be no further adjournment after Monday, he would be the last person in the world to object to the proposition.
 Mr. Brougham  entirely concurred with the noble lord in the expression of that great reluctance which must be felt on both sides of the House, that any longer delay should take place, unless a most absolute necessity were shown. At the same time, the delay which had occurred hitherto, he must declare; had been perfectly unavoidable. He took upon himself to say that neither party had been to blame; and that it was impossible to show a greater wish to expedite the business than had been manifested by both throughout the matter. He begged leave to add, his own opinion was, that beyond Monday next no circumstances, so far as human probability could anticipate them, would warrant any farther adjournment of the business. He would beg to say one word more: he entreated that the House would keep its mind entirely in the same stats that it was upon the first night this subject was broached; that it would consider that it stood now, and should stand upon Monday next, until the debate came on in precisely the same situation as before.
 Mr. Abercromby  said, he had stated no opinion of his own, originally, but had quoted an opinion, an extremely alarming one, of the chancellor of the exchequer. He had since heard his qualification, which was, that his was a partial and not a general statement. How far it was partial or general must be collected from the proposed erection of barracks all over the country.
 Mr. Abercromby  observed, that be would not have said a single word on this occasion, were it not that he felt it necessary to state the reasons which induced blip to vote for the motion of his hon. friend. He did not mean to enter now into that part of the question, which from the statement of the chancellor of the exchequer, appeared to be of so alarming a nature, particularly to those who understood the principles of the constitution. It would be idle now to enter upon that part of the question. The right hon. member had taken credit for a reduction being made in the barrack department, while on the other hand it was shown that it had been progressively increasing daring the last three years. In a word, the statement of the chancellor of the exchequer was neither more nor less than this, that such was the state of the population of this country; such was the alienation of the people's feelings from the government of the country, that his majesty's
 1119
 Mr. Lockhart  wished to know how many penitents were at present confined in the Penitentiary.
 Mr. Lockhart  said, he was afraid, if the bill of fare of the honest poor who had been driven into Lambeth workhouse, for instance, by the pressure of the times and of taxation, were compared with that of these persons who were imprisoned for their crimes, the comparison would be much to the advantage of the latter. These convicts had each a separate room, fared well, had a physician for their bodies, and a priest for their souls. He thought it a bad system that persons who were under punishment for crime, should be in a better situation than those who were suffering from misfortune.
 Mr. Lockhart  said, he had no such feelings as had been imputed to him; but when he saw that with improved prisons and new charities, crimes were increasing, he felt that the country was losing its way on an amiable system, and that what was really wanted was a preventive police. He protested against any plan which should put criminals in a better situation than the unfortunate.
 Mr. Lockhart  contended, that such charity, in fact, was an encouragement of crimes. The first offence should not be so lightly spoken of. A vigorous police would seize the offenders before they committed the crime, and while they were loitering and plotting, crimes.
 Mr. Lockhart  observed, that all who had pleaded their own cause had been found guilty.
 Mr. Hume  objected to this vote on the ground that parliamentary interference was dangerous. If a sum of money was to be granted to this institution, many other institutions in the metropolis, equally deserving of consideration, and with equally strong claims might and would ask for parliamentary assistance.
 Mr. Hume  said, he did not want to, have grants for secret service money altogether done away; he only objected to the extent of the present grant.
 Mr. Hume  said, that in the last year a sum of 80,000 l. l. l. l. l. l.
 Mr. Hume  said, that a considerable discussion had taken place last year in the committee regarding the erection of a steam-engine in the Penitentiary for the purpose of easing the labour which the prisoners endured in drawing water and in grinding flour. The committee,
 1130
 Mr. Hume  thought that this work, which had already cost so much money, ought to be completed; at the same time he could not help expressing his conviction that more than 60,000 l. 1133 l. l. l.
 Mr. Hume  could not refrain from declaring that the subject was one on which he thought the people ought justly to feel great alarm. There were no less than 97 barracks in the country; all of them with regular establishments. It bad been lately said by ministers, that the additional troops were requisite to meet a temporary exigency; if so, why provide them with permanent accommodation? In Manchester, for instance, where there was already one barrack, another was erecting at an expense of 28,000 l.
 Mr. Hume  wished for some explanation of the reason, why the estimate of the present year was nearly 100,000 l. l. l.
 Mr. Hume  said, that the preparations which were making for the coronation were but of a temporary nature: an unnecessary expense appeared to be incurring. Preparations intended for a mere temporary purpose were got up on a scale as expensive as if the different public situations for the coronation were to last, not for a day, but for thirty or forty years.
 Mr. Hume  said, he was aware of what the object of the volunteer corps was, and perhaps the House would be surprised when they heard that object, and the way in which it was intended to provide for them. The object was to protect the company's
 1103
 Mr. Finlay,  adverting to former measures which had been adopted under similar circumstances in this country, observed, that they had been productive of the greatest advantage to the community. He hoped and believed that the effect of the proposition would, in a great degree, arrest the evil.
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  called upon the noble lord to state some reason for so extraordinary a proceeding in a time of peace, and when it had been resolved to disembody the corps of infantry. Until he had a satisfactory reason he must oppose such a bill.
 Mr. R. Ward  order to show the necessity of erecting the barracks which had, been recently built in the country, adverted to several places, and particularly Chester arid carlisle, where such precautions had been taken in consequence of those places having been reconnoitred by the radicals, and declared so vulnerable that they might be taken in half an hour. With reference especially to the latter city he had lately witnessed a scene there which sufficiently proved the necessity of military protection; and he was persuaded that the hon. and learned member for Winchelsea, who was present at that scene, if he were in the House, would corroborate his statement: he had seen a number of respectable individuals—ladies, and gentlemen—who were going to a public entertainment in Carlisle, grossly insulted by the populace, and told that it was the last time they should ride in their carriages, and the last time they should wear diamonds. He was confident that the tranquillity of the country required
 1115
 Mr. Creevey  said, he observed, in the present estimates, a sum of 14,000 l. l. l. l. s. l. l. l. l. 1122
 Mr. Creevey  considered it necessary, before the House agreed to such a measure, to ascertain whether the company were competent to meet the charge. That House should have the India budget before them, and a full inquiry into their actual condition.
 Mr. Creevey  asked, whether the amount of that expense would be submitted to parliament before the ceremony of the coronation shall take place?
 Mr. Creevey  wished to know when those expenses would be brought under consideration.
 Mr. T. Wilson  conceived gentlemen were wrong when they attributed all the evils of the country to the measures of
 1123
 Mr. Huskisson  said, that if the hon. member would only look into the act he would see a special provision requiring that money granted for secret service should be duly accounted for under the authority of the secretary of state.
 Mr. Huskisson  said, it had always been the custom to retain the attorney-general and the solicitor general in Crown prosecutions, and that, although they might not appear in person on the trial, they
 1136
 Mr. Huskisson  understood the hon. gentleman to say, that he considered the prosecutions which had taken place during the last year to have been totally unnecessary. If the trials which had taken place at the Old Bailey for high-treason,—if the prosecutions for sedition at York, Lancaster, Chester, Warwick, Leicester, and other places, were indeed unnecessary, then of course the grants which had been voted to carry them on, were a waste of the public money. But if it was the opinion of the House, that the Crown should have power to institute prosecutions, it was necessary to supply it with money for that purpose. He could not help remarking, that objections to the amount of expense incurred by Crown prosecutions came with rather a bad grace from gentlemen on the opposite side of the house, when it was recollected that ministers had been so frequently reproved by them for making new laws, instead of prosecuting to a greater extent under the existing laws. The hon. gentleman said, that this grant was made to pay fees to all the legal talent at the bar, and to prevent defendants from having the benefit of eminent counsel. It certainly was the duty of king's counsel to give the Crown the benefit of their services; but the hon. gentleman was mistaken in supposing that all the expense was incurred by retaining-fees, for a considerable part of these charges was incurred by the attendance of witnesses, and the issuing of summonses. A part of the sum of 40,000 l.
 Mr. W. Smith  said, that every shilling of the money granted for the same purpose for many years had been misapplied. It would appear from the accounts, not merely for the last years, but for many years before, that the money which had been expended did not in any degree promote the expected object. The slave trade was not, in consequence of that expenditure, prevented. Were he to speak out on this subject, he would use very severe epithets indeed. He considered the expenditure any thing but advantageous to the country. He had no hesitation in saying, that the transfer to the government of those forts from the African company was a salutary measure. In the first place, a sum of 1,200 l.
 Mr. W. Smith  expressed his regret that such large sums should be voted in such a manner. This was a question of confidence. It might be right to extend confidence to ministers, but here this

 Sir G. Hill  argued, that whatever might be the culpability of overtrading on the part of individuals, which perhaps might have been the case, the innocent and industrious were not to be indiscriminately punished with the improvident. There was more than one precedent for such a proceeding: in the case where parliament voted a similar mode of relief to Ireland in 1793, not a shilling had ultimately been lost; but a balance had been made out in favour of the country.
 Sir H. Parnell  wished to be informed whether the Irish barrack department was not under the control of the Treasury. If there was reason to complain of the expense of that establishment here, there was still greater reason to complain of it in Ireland. The expense, last year, in that country, was 123,000 l.
 Mr. W. Parnell  supported the resolution.
 Sir H. Parnell  was convinced that those who looked upon this canal as a public work of no utility had taken a very mistaken view of the subject. He looked forward to it as a source of future revenue, and therefore thought that no objection ought to be made to the grant in question.
 Sir Joseph Yorke  said, he understood
 1129 l. l.
 Lord Althorp  expressed some surprise at what had just fallen from the right hon. gentleman. When this subject was before the committee last year, they had been told that not more than 75,000 l. l. l. l.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that be felt it to be his duty to apprize the House, that his majesty, feeling that every effort should be made to prevent the necessity of proceeding farther with the delicate question which had recently been brought under their notice, had consented that it should be considered elsewhere. In consequence of the course adopted having failed to produce the desired effect, he was authorized by his majesty to present certain papers, by which the whole of the proceeding would be communicated to parliament. He felt great pain in stating that the course proposed and adopted had not led to any satisfactory arrangement on the subject. From the great importance and the extreme delicacy of the question, the discussion of which had been repeatedly deferred, he felt that it would be very improper on his part, and exceedingly unfair towards the House, to press the consideration of the subject until gentlemen possessed the most authentic information connected with it. By that means the House would be relieved from the painful situation in which it at present stood, and would be enabled to judge of the efforts that had been made to arrange this unfortunate business. The papers were now in the progress of being printed, and would be given out to gentlemen early to-morrow. He therefore felt it to be his duty to move that the House should adjourn over, till Wednesday, the consideration of this question. It was necessary, before they proceeded to the farther consideration of the king's message, that all the circumstances of the case should be laid before them; that they should be enabled, at once, to view it in all its bearings, before they determined how they were to dispose of a question surrounded by so many difficulties. His lordship then moved, "that the papers do lie on the table."
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that the hon. member had taken the two millions of francs, which was the French contribution, as pounds. In allusion to what had fallen from Mr. Baring, he admitted the great importance of that subject, and could only plead as an excuse for having omitted it, the necessary complication of so many points as it had been his duty to refer to. In the course of last year the deficiency on the consolidated fund had amounted to 3,000,0002. The deficiency, however, had arisen before the new taxes became productive, and also included the charge of two loans—those of the years 1818 and 1819. The new taxes covered that charge, and left a surplus of 1,800,000 l. l.
 Mr. Grenfell  wished for some farther explanation as to the expected amount of the sinking fund.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  professed his readiness to lay before the committee every particular of the arrangements which he had in view, and upon which he framed his calculations. It was true, as the hon. member seemed to think, that it was his intention to cancel stock to the amount of this proportion of unfunded debt. This proceeding referred to an act of 1813, which provided for making stock in the hands of the commissioners applicable to the service of the year, and under which a plan was devised for accumulating stock to the amount of 100,000,000 l. l. l.
 Mr. Grenfell  contended, that the plan of the right hon. gentleman was still calculated to diminish rather than cause any real excess of the revenue over the expenditure. With reference to the consolidated fund, he repeated what he had said on a recent occasion, that it was a most unseemly and odious blot on the character of the government, to allow of a constant deficiency in that fund of between seven and eight millions; and he strongly urged the expediency either by a loan, by the issue of exchequer bills, or by some other
 1170
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  rose. He stated, that feeling how difficult it was under the circumstances in which the House was then situated, for him to obtain that attention without which a financial discussion could not be intelligible or satisfactory, he should in the shortest, as well as the clearest, manner in his power state those particulars which it was his more immediate duty to bring under the consideration of parliament on that day, without attempting to enter into the discussion of general topics, which might he introduced with equal propriety on other occasions. l. l., 1162 l.; l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l., l. 1163 l. l. l. l. l., l. l. l. l., l. l. l., l. 1164 l. l. l. l., l. l., l. l. l. l. 1165 l. l. l., l. l., l. l. l. l. 1166 l., l. l. l., 1167 l. l. 1168 *
 Mr. Baring  did not intend to examine any part of the right hon. gentleman's statement, but rose chiefly to express some degree of surprise that no information had been communicated with regard to the consolidated fund.
 *
 Mr. Maberly  could not but remark the great difference that existed between the present propositions of the right hon. gentleman and those which he had made last year. Last year he came down to that House, and said, that during the preceding year, he had been acting upon temporary expedients, but that he was then beginning to act upon a permanent plan, whose operation would be to make a sinking fund of 5,000,000 l. l. l. l. 1175 l.; l. l. l., l., l. l. l. l. 1176
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  admitted, that the public had not yet made all those sacrifices, which, unfortunately, were necessary to the national security; but he felt convinced that they would not shrink from any sacrifices, when convinced of their necessity, and that every possible measure of retrenchment had been resorted to by government. Whether these contributions were made in the shape of a property-tax, or in any other shape, was a matter of no consequence. With respect to the present situation of the country, he felt the importance of an efficacious and productive sinking-fund; and he hoped that the produce of that fund would this year be considerable. There had been in the course of the last year a reduction of the public debt, although that reduction had not been so large as could be wished.
 Mr. Alderman Heygate,  in considering the state of the consolidated fund, deprecated those measures which went to relieve a present inconvenience by the assistance of a loan. If the chancellor of the exchequer adopted the counsel which had been given him by several gentlemen, the effect would be to pay 5 per cent for the loan of that which the Bank now furnished, partly at a very low rate of interest, and partly without any interest at all. According to an arrangement which

 Sir Joseph  Yorke thought the buildings already finished were quite sufficient for the purpose of experiment. This grant was for a new building. He thought it very wrong on the part of government to embark in such expensive undertakings, for the purpose of indulging any member in a favourite object of speculation. The expense of printing for both Houses scarcely amounted to less than 100,000 l.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  allowed that they were a meritorious body of men. To comply with their demands would, however, be establishing a very inconvenient precedent. They were in the same situation as many others were placed in by the chances of war.
 Mr. Courtenay  regretted the view taken of this subject by the chancellor of the exchequer. He could hot allow that the case of these claimants was similar to that of any others. Their claims stood on the faith of parliament and were quite distinct from any others.
 Mr. Ricardo  said, he could not clearly understand the alleged benefit which the money-market was to receive from the right hon. gentleman's arrangement. It was certainly a subject of lamentation that, after five years of peace, we should still find our expenses increasing. According to the right hon. gentleman we had had effectually a sinking fund of but 1,000,000 l. l. l. l., l. l. l. l., l. † 1173 l. l. l. l. l. l. l. l. 1174 l.: l. l. l. l.
 Mr. Holford  justified it, and referred to the authority of Howard.
 Lord Nugent  observed, that it was his intention to have asked a question of the noble secretary of War had he been in his place. As that noble lord was absent, he should beg to ask his majesty's judge advocate the same question. He had learned that the late disturbance amongst a portion of the guards was attributed to the failure in issuing a certain rate of allowance which I was called riot money. Recollecting that a very considerable allowance, both of bounty and pay, was made to the soldiers, he could not recognise the propriety of any increase when they were called upon for duty in any service. Knowing also, that if they were ordered to march for foreign service no such increased rate of allowance was either given or expected, by what rule should it be granted when employed against their fellow-citizens? As a very important question stood for discussion that night, he should hot enlarge upon the point at present; but he wished to; hear from his majesty's judge advocate how long it had been the practice of the; government to issue the increased allowance of riot money.
 Mr. Brougham,  in seconding the motion, begged to express to the House his concurrence in the view the noble lord had taken of this subject. He assured
 1161
 Mr. Lockhart  observed, that the whole building would cost 600,000 l., l. l.
 Mr. John Smith  disagreed altogether from the hon. gentleman who had just spoken, as to the operation of the sinking fund; and maintained that it created a market for stock, and thereby prevented its depreciation. Adverting to the general question of our financial condition, he observed, that although he by no means charged it as matter of blame, yet that in fact almost all the expectations which had been last year held out by the chancellor of the exchequer had been disappointed. Our revenue had decreased, and our expenses augmented; and that, five years after the termination of war! He confessed that he had long entertained a melancholy foreboding of our actual condition. For the first time he had observed a suspicion and a distrust of the credit of this country. This was a new feature in our situation. In the midst of the late long and dangerous war, this country had been considered the asylum of property. Foreigners brought property of every description to England; but things were sot much changed, that many Englishmen were at the present moment investing a
 1171 l. 1172
 Mr. John Smith  objected to the vote of 60,000 l.
 Mr. Hume  said, he had voted for the original construction of the edifice; but the estimate then only amounted to the half of what had already been expended. He was in favour of the resolution, that the building might be completed; and, after its completion, government might gain experience.
 Mr. Hume  wished to know whether there was any intention of allowing the claims of the American loyalists for the balance due to them. They were assured that the losses they had sustained would be fully made good to them. This, however, had not been yet done, though the subject had been frequently under consideration. He could look upon it as nothing less than a breach of the public faith.
 Mr. Hume  inquired whether the French contribution of two millions was forthcoming.
 Mr. Huskisson  agreed, that it would be highly desirable that the consolidated fund, instead of being in arrear, should afford a surplus over and above the service of the year; and wished that the state of the country would admit of the sinking fund being made more efficient. In answer to what had fallen from the hon.
 1179 l.
 Mr. W. Smith  fully concurred in the sentiments of the hon. gentleman who spoke last. The only bar he could see in the way of the claimants, was their acceptance of a certain portion of what was fairly due to them. This, however, should form ho objection against allowing what, by every tie of justice, the country was bound to pay. Their claims were as fair, and as strong as any in the annals of war. They had not been allowed to lie dormant. They had been revived, at different intervals, during a period of thirty years. Three fourths of the claimants Were now dead; and many of them from broken hearts, in consequence of their disappointments. Lord Shelburne and Mr. Burke, though opposed to the American war, had allowed that there were no men better entitled to the consideration of the country.
 Mr. Beckett  said, he should be glad to give the noble lord a distinct answer, but he was only able at present to state, that such arrangements were made by the secretary at war.
 Mr. Marryat  said:—Mr. Speaker;—I hold in my hand a petition from the merchants and others engaged in trade with the British colonies in North America. In this petition they refer to another, which was lately presented to this House by certain merchants of the

 Lord Castlereagh  said, that in cases of negotiation, it was not necessary, as had been supposed by the hon. and learned gentleman for the government to take the opinion of the House at all. So in the case of the negotiations at Vienna, the House was not called upon to express any opinion previously. He, therefore, had nothing whatever to propose to the House on this subject. And his own sentiments would naturally be expressed when, upon moving the order of the day, some proposition should be brought forward with a view to render it unnecessary. The hon. member appeared to think that that pro-

 The Attorney General,  in moving that the House do resolve itself into a committee on this bill, said, that he was aware some objections were felt to the measure, particularly by members of the bar. No one was more anxious than him self to gratify the wishes and interests of the profession, and if the inconvenience which might be supposed to follow the bill did not fall much below the good that would result from it, he would not have introduced it. At present the chief justice was not allowed to sit at  nisi prius nisi prius
 Lord A. Hamilton  wished merely to say, that the object of his right hon. friend was to ascertain at least the principle of the proposed motion. It seemed to be certain that that motion was to have the precedence to-morrow; and he did think, after what had occurred.:—after the papers had been printed and put into the hands of members—and after all the preparations they had made to come down to the adjourned debate of to-morrow that it would not have been too much for the hon. gentleman to have stated the substance at least of his motion. He did not ask him to mention the terms, but the object ought surely to be known.
 Mr. Warren  was of opinion, considering the state of the business in the King's-bench, that this bill was absolutely necessary. What was the situation of the court at the present moment? There were about 108 causes in arrear at Westminster, and 200 in the city of London, forming an aggregate of 308 remanent causes. Any measure that tended to decrease such an arrear ought to he supported by the House. The object of the bill W3s, to employ two judges in performing the duty, which was now effected by one—a plan from which great and evident advantage would be derived. The learned gentlemen apprehended that much inconvenience would be felt from the adoption of the proposed mode. Now, he did not mean to deny that some bill, more extensive in its nature, might perhaps be hereafter necessary; but that, he conceived, was not a good reason for objecting to the bill now before the House, if, for the time present, it wrought well. If the clause relative to the duration of the bill went to render it permanent, he certainly would oppose it; but, as the learned attorney-general was of opinion that the object would be practically obtained by making the measure temporary, and as ha had given notice that lie would, in the committee, move
 1192
 Mr. Warren —If he understood the learned gentleman correctly, his statement was, that, unless the salary of the judge was raked, he would not undertake the duty. Another objection to the bill was, that the client would often be deprived of the benefit of that counsel whom he wished to employ. In some cases this would certainly be very disad-
 1193
 Lord Nugent,  seeing the secretary at war in his place, rose to repeat the question he had put yesterday on the important subject of the late disturbance among a portion of the military, which had been produced, as it seemed, by the withholding of certain allowances. In adverting to this subject, he felt sure that he need not vindicate himself from the imputation of endeavouring to apologize for the motives which gave rise to the alarming claim to which he had alluded, though it was one of the many fatal evils arising out of the system of military government. His question was, for what reasons, and out. of what funds, any pay or allowances had been given for special services of the military at home, when no such pay or allowances were given on service abroad?
 Lord Nugent  expressed his pleasure at the satisfactory explanation afforded by the noble secretary at war. He thought that the sum disbursed, however trifling, ought to come under the cognizance of parliament, though, for obvious reasons, he did not now wish to submit a motion upon the subject. He saw no sufficient reason for these rations, when the service at home was at all events lighter than that through which the men passed in the course of a foreign campaign. He ac-
 1189
 Mr. Tierney  really thought, under the general language of the hon. gentleman's notice, that the best way would have been to have given no notice at all. If his hon. friend would now, however, state more particularly what his intentions were, and what course he intended to pursue, he would relieve himself and his hon. friends: from the degree of uncertainty in which they now stood relative to the member for Bramber's object.
 Mr. Tierney  observed, that the hon. member expressed a wish to hear suggestions from the House, without giving them any opportunity of knowing upon what subject. He once more asked, not for himself but for the information of the House, what the nature of the hon. member's motion was? He could see no difficulty in stating generally what was intended to be done.
 Mr. Brougham  was sure the House would do him the justice to believe that he fully concurred with the noble lord in thinking any course which should be adverse to the standing orders of the day was not an advisable one; but, as the noble lord seemed to feel that no defence was at all necessary to be set up, as regarded his majesty's government, so he (Mr. B.) felt it necessary, in their vindication to say, that he was perfectly satisfied that the conduct of her majesty's legal advisers, and the conduct of her majesty herself, stood also in need of no defence. He was perfectly willing to leave both to the candour of the House and the justice: of the country, and to abide by the award I of their impartial judgment.
 Mr. Brougham  begged the House to remember that to-morrow was a motion day, and therefore that the one of which the hon. gentleman had just given notice would have the precedence. He submitted to the House, in the mean time, whether it would not be expedient, seeing how deeply the hon. gentleman was engaged, in common with every other hon. member, in the result of this motion, that that should take place with respect to it which took place in regard to every motion where the government was itself engaged, as in cases where negotiations had taken place. He would appeal to the noble lord whether or no, in such cases, it was not usual to take the sense of the House previously to bringing forward the motion. The reason upon which he stated thus much was, that he took it for granted that his hon. friend was about to propose, either directly or indirectly, some renewal of the present broken negotiation. At the same time, this presumption was only founded upon the very general wording of his hon. friend's notice: he believed, however, that in such a case, it was to be expected that the hon. gentleman would favour them with the intentions he entertained in giving notice of such a proposition.
 Mr. Lockhart  said, the learned gentleman who had just sat down had argued that, if the measure proposed were likely to remove, for the present, the inconvenience complained of, it ought to be adopted. He entirely denied the truth of this position. Ha did not consider that all inconveniences and misfortunes were good for nothing. They frequently had their benefits within themselves. For his own part, he could wish the inconveni-

 Mr. Nolan  observed, that as the object and tendency of this measure was to facilitate the administration of justice, the generality of the gentlemen of the law would be decided advocates for its adoption, whether it interfered with1 their own individual interests or not. He contended that this was only a temporary relaxation of the duties of the chief justice. He did not consider that by its adoption an alteration would be made in the constitution of the court of exchequer.
 Mr. Denman  felt the strongest objections to the measure now proposed. In the first instance it was to have been permanent, but now, he understood, it was to; be temporary. In either point of view: it was objectionable. If it were permanent, it would effect a permanent alteration in the court of King's-bench, and if temporary, it would produce one of the greatest evils that could be found in a; court of justice—a temporary and experimental course of judicature. Why should such a measure pass? Was the King's-bench the only court in Westminster-ball to which causes should be sent? If so, then the twelve judges should belong to; that court. But if there were two other courts, sitting almost in idleness, he thought it would show more good sense to alter their situation, rather than to remodel that court, in which justice was so; perfectly administered, as to create the very arrear that was objected to. That arrear, he contended, was not an evil for which the court was answerable. It was a circumstance caused by the popularity of the court. One court would be pen haps capriciously what might be termed a fashionable court; to it the suitors would resort, and there would be found the arrear. If, however, instead of in a king the two other courts act, they erected a third, perhaps it would be found that they had only added another to the idle courts already existing, while the King's-bench still remained encumbered with a vast mass of business. By this new plan more labour was to be thrown on the puisne judges, and he thought it was

 Mr. Wilberforce  said, that his motion in a great measure explained itself; its object undoubtedly was to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to an amicable arrangement of the differences existing between their majesties.
 Mr. Wilberforce  would have been happy to have heard what his right hon. friend had to propose as the distinct alterations to be adopted in his notice. The terms of that notice., not being drawn up on paper, might be very well susceptible of such alterations as would result from trifling varieties of opinion or slight shades of explanation. The motion in question, he thought it would be almost impossible for the House to resist, believing, as he did, that there prevailed in that House, as well as throughout the country, a real
 1187
 Mr. Wilberforce  said, he would rather decline for the present giving any further explanation. He did not wish that his motion should have the precedence, although he could not help thanking his noble friend for the readiness which he had shown to concede it to him. His noble friend, by that concession, evinced a desire, in which he was joined by the whole country, to avoid, if possible, all further inquiry into this disastrous subject [Hear, hear!].
 Mr. Wilberforce  gave notice, that it was his intention to-morrow to propose to the House a motion founded upon the papers which had been laid upon the table, and ordered to be printed.
 Mr. Chetwynd  objected to the bill, first, because it was unwise in its provisions, and, next, because it imposed a greater degree of labour on the puisne judges of the court of King's-bench, without providing for them any additional remuneration. Much of the time of the court was taken up in consequence of  ex-officio 1196 l.
 Mr. Scarlett. —I stated that the learned judge did not approve of the bill.
 Mr. Scarlett  said, that in duty to the profession of the law, he felt himself bound to oppose the bill. It was said that business: pressed upon the court, but if the trifling causes were removed from that court which Were of no benefit to the suitors, but, on the contrary, ended in the ruin both of the plaintiff1 and the defendant, it would relieve the court and benefit the public. But when it was said that the business of the court had greatly increased for the last years, he begged leave to deny it, and, in support of his assertion, referred to a statement, by
 1190 nisi prius nisi, prius nisi prius 1191 nisi prius. l. l. l.
 Mr. Scarlett  felt, as every man must do, the greatest possible reluctance to go into this subject at all, but, knowing nothing excepting what appeared on the paper, Would the hon. gentleman allow him to ask, whether his motion was of a nature to restore the name of her majesty to the Liturgy? because he took it for granted that such was the proposition he intended to make.
 Lord Palmerston  was happy to afford the noble lord information upon this point. It was a mistake to suppose that the late discontents in one battalion of the guards had any reference to pay or allowances: the men had alleged no such grievance, but the disorganization was produced by a notion, certainly unfounded, that the duty they were called upon to discharge was more severe than other battalions performed. Some years ago (whether at the time of the passing of the Corn bill, or when sir F. Burdett was conveyed to the Tower; he could not state) a practice had grown up in consequence of the employment of the men at night at a distance from their barracks, when they had no opportunity of procuring food, of giving the soldiers on duty certain small rations of bread, cheese, and beer, not in money, but in kind; and even this was never allowed but when the nature of the service particularly required it. It was paid for out of the commissariat department, on an account being verified of the number of loaves, and the quantity of cheese and beer, consumed. If tile noble lord wished for a statement of the amount thus disbursed, it could be furnished.
 Lord Castlereagh  assured the House that he felt considerable difficultyin rising to address them at that moment; and that but for paticular circumstances he shpi;d not have wished to intrude himself on the House before his hon. friend the member for Corfe Castle, who had risen at the same moment as himself. He was not so vain of his own powers as to hope that he could rivet the attention of gentlemen in the same degree that the hon. And learned member who had just addressed them had done. Indeed, the great difficulty he felt was occasioned by his being obliged to rise in opposition to the powerful impression which the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman had made on the house. He had made on the House. He had spoken on this as on other occasions, with all the talent
 1246
 Lord castlereagh  said, he would wait till the hon. and learned gentleman returned.
 Lord Castlereagh  expressed his regret at the delay. From the view he had taken, of this question, he meant to have addressed the House in a later stage of the debate, which he might have done with propriety, because no proposition was submitted to there, but that of his hon. friend, which he did not mean to op pose. But the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman, which was delivered very early in the debate, rendered it. necessary that he should explain himself as soon as possible, on certain topics which the hon. and learned gentleman had introduced.
 Lord Castlereagh  was willing to delay his observations to any period of the night that might best suit the convenience of the hon. and learned gentleman, to whom he intended the course which he had first adopted, as a mark of respect. The House must be aware, that from the nature of the relation in which they had been placed towards each other by the late proceedings, the line of argument employed by the hon. gentleman could only be met by him (lord Castlereagh), and in wishing to have his observations heard immediately by the hon. member, he was actuated by a desire to ascertain how much they understood each other. The House being cut off from the knowledge of many facts, could not possibly understand the effect of many of his (lord Castlereagh's) remarks, and therefore in the absence of the only hon. member to whom his remarks could be intelligible, he would have taken up the time of the House in vain.
 Lord Castlereagh  acknowledged, that in the course of the negotiations, however he might have differed from the law advisers of her majesty as to the matter of negotiation, there could be but one opinion as" to the conciliatory tone in which
 1249 1250 de jure, 1251 1252 1253 1254 de jure 1255 1256 sine qua non, 1257 1258 1259
 Sir F. Burdett  seconded the amendment.
 Mr. Bankes  hoped the prediction of the hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down, that if his hon. friend's motion were agreed to, there would be more discussion on the subject, would be falsified. It was in this hope he was induced to rise and support the motion, and from a wish that this interposition on the part of the House of Commons might settle those differences which, as yet could not be arranged either by letters lor.conferences,—He bad heard the hon. and learned gentleman with great pleasure, but one observation suggested, itself as arising put of his speech. He wondered the law advisers of the queen, had so long delayed to introduce the point of the Liturgy upon which the whole case seemed now to turn.—Why had not the House heard something before of the omission of her majesty's name? The hon. and learned gentleman said, that he had only recently become her majesty's adviser; but was not the hon. and learned gentleman in the last parliament, and had he not then opportunities enough of protesting against that measure which was new affirmed by Irim to be against law.—When the hon. and learned gentleman asserted that the omission of the queen's name, was made at the discretion of the privy council, the hon. gentleman must have forgotten the 13 and 14 of Charles Sad. A noble lord seemed to be under some mistake, when he spoke of certain ministers of the church persevering in praying to: the queen, upon conscientious
 1276 1277 sine, qua non. 1278
 Mr. Williams  said, he should state very shortly his reasons for the vote which he meant to give. In looking at the question, he thought the consideration of, how far the honour of one party would be committed, or how much the triumph of another would be magnified, should not be at all calculated. In this view, therefore, he saw no obstacle to ministers restoring the queen's name to the Liturgy. By the 13th and 14th of Charles 2nd, a particular form of prayer was pointed out to be used on all occasions, and he contended, that the clause which empowered the king and privy council to make the necessary alterations from time to time, referred only to the power of changing the name, as the title of any branch of the royal family might be altered, and did not extend to the power of exclusion all together. He believed there was no precedent to prove the queen of England had ever been left out of the Liturgy. Having shown that in a legal construction of the act ministers were not warranted in leaving out her majesty's name, he next came to consider what possible injury could ensue from supplying the omission? It would satisfy her majesty's scruples, without derogating from the dignity of the monarch. He did not blame ministers for leaving the queen's name out of the Liturgy, for they did not know but it might be their duty to prefer charges against her. So far he gave them credit; but if the time had now arrived at which either policy or other motives prevented the prosecution of those
 1279
 Sir Francis Burdett  said, it was not his intention to go over any of those topics which had been urged by other hon. members with much greater ability than he possessed. It was his wish to approach this question with an unprejudiced mind; and. while he claimed justice for that party which stood most in need of justice, he was anxious not to say any thing that might be construed into a want of respect for the Crown on this very painful occasion. The hon. member for Bramber had, in his opinion, taken a very erroneous view of the question. That hon. member had declared that the House must either agree to his proposition, or to some other conciliatory resolution of a similar nature, or else go into the immediate consideration of the contents of the green bag. He dissented entirely from the hon. member for Bramber. So far was he from thinking that the House was reduced to such a dilemma, that it did not appear to him that there was any possibility, after all that had been said, even by his majesty's ministers themselves, that the House, consistently with a regard to its own character, to the dignity of the Crown, to the respect due to the family on the throne, and above all to the interests of the public, ever could consent that the green bag should be opened. ex-parte 1280 logicé logicé 1281 logicé vestigia nulla retrorsum. 1282 1283 1284 in terrorem, 1285 1286 1287 pro tanto 1288 "To the liege lord of my dear native land I owe a subject's homage; yet even him And his high arbitration I'd regret. Within my bosom dwells another lord— HONOUR—sole judge and umpire, of itself!" 1289 1290 1291 1292 1293 1294 1295 1296 1297
 Mr. Hutchinson  then rose, but the impatience of the House long prevented him from being heard. He observed, that if he had rightly understood the hon. and learned gentleman, he had said, that he was ignorant of the capacity in which lord Hutchinson appeared at St. Omer's.
 Mr. Hutchinson  declared, that although this might be the case, he was confident that when all the circumstances were disclosed, they would reflect additional lustre on the already high and proud reputation of his noble relative. Both he and his noble relation were perfectly willing to join in those humane and honourable feelings which had been expressed with so much eloquence that night. Lord Hutchinson had placed himself in a most painful situation, with the view of preventing a great public mischief, and if the queen had not been most wretchedly advised, he would have succeeded in that object.—This would, he was satisfied, fully appear
 1312
 Lord Castlereagh,  in explanation, said, that his hon. friend had expatiated more strongly on his reasoning than any thing which he had stated would warrant. He had repeatedly declared, that the decision on the Liturgy had been taken by ministers, in contemplation of the charges of which they were at that time in possession. But he never had said that ministers came to that decision for the purpose of fixing a stigma on the royal personage. He had stated that they agreed in the measure for the purpose of avoiding a stigma [A laugh.] It was quite astonishing to see how eager gentlemen opposite were to arrive at their favourite conclusion, which was, to prevent all accommodation; but they could neither deceive the House nor the country [Order, order.] It was impossible not to be thrown out of one's natural bias of temper under such circumstances. He admitted that if the name of the duke of York had been placed in the Liturgy, and that of the queen excluded, it would have been a stigma. But, in the way in which it was done, it was that species of neutral measure which could not be considered a stigma. He did not mean to say that it placed her majesty in the same situation as if she had been specifically included in the prayer, or that it was a situation in which ministers, if those grave charges had not been preferred against her, would have found themselves justified in placing her. But, having heard those charges, they could not act otherwise than they had done, without placing themselves in
 1314
 Lord Archibald Hamilton  declared, that he was under the necessity of waiting until the motion before the House was read, before he could comprehend the hon. mover's intention—before he could determine upon the course which it was his duty to pursue. In proposing the amendment which he felt it his right to submit to the consideration of the House, as well as in the observations with which he should preface it, he begged to be understood that he spoke from no authority bat his own; and that he was not acting, in any connection whatever, with the queen's legal advisers. He had not, indeed, decided, until he came to the House, in what terms to couch his motion. There was, perhaps, no person in that House who felt more alarm than himself at the consequences but too likely to result from a public investigation of the subject which gave rise to this discussion; and therefore he was among the most eager to deprecate such a course of proceeding. In bringing forward the proposition which he had in view, he had no other object in view than that of doing substantial justice between the two illustrious individuals who were parties to the present discussion, and of had more of the House a proposition which had more of the spirit of conciliation in it than that which had been offered to them by his hon. friend the member for Bramber. For, what was the nature of that hon. gentleman's proposition; and in what manner was it connected with the measures which had preceded it? He would inform them. His hon. friend came to the House, and he could assure his
 1260 1261 1262 1263 1264 1265
 Mr. Canning  began by declaring that, however much provoked by the speech which had been just delivered, he should abstain on the present occasion from entering into the lists with the hon. baronet, more out of respect to the real subject matter of the debate, which he thought ought not to be mixed with topics of personal vituperation and party invective, than (as he hoped the House would do him the justice to acknowledge) from any habitual indisposition to accept a challenge in debate when charged with want of principle, or with inconsistency of practice. He felt it his duty to recall the attention of the House to the much more interesting considerations involved in the motion before them. 1298 1299 1300 1301 1302 l. 1303 l. income. 1304 1305 1306 1307
 Mr. Tierney  observed, that as the better part of valour was discretion, the right hon. gentleman had thought fit to postpone his defence of ministers till the effect of the hon. baronet's speech had worn away. The right hon. gentleman had said, that ministers were not afraid to meet either boisterous accusers or clamorous cheers; but never had so golden an opportunity of vindication as the present been neglected. If a speech which could not fail to excite the interest of
 1308 1309 salvo honore; 1310
 Mr Tierney  said, that in consequence of indisposition, exertion, und the great heat of the. House, his horn and learned friend felt it necessary to withdraw for a short time. The debate need not, however, be interrupted on that account. If the noble lord did not wish to proceed at present, the hon. gentleman below him who rose, firs might deliver his sentiments. His hon. and learned friend would return, as soon as the slight indisposition he felt would permit.
 Mr. Brougham  said, it only remained for him to remove the suspicion, that in withdrawing himself at the moment, he was intentionally guilty of any disrespect to the House.
 Mr. Brougham  took the liberty of presenting himself to the notice of the House thus early in the debate, partly because, from an indisposition tinder which he laboured, he feared he might not be able to deliver his sentiments at a later period; and partly because he wished to take the first opportunity of expressing, with that candour and frankness which the great importance of the question demanded, and, at the same time, with that sincere respect for his hon. friend which long intimacy and a concurrence in the esteem of the country (at least that part of it whose esteem was worth having) had pro-

 Mr. Brougham  submitted to the House, that it was perfectly unprecedented for any one member to insist that another, who had a severe complaint in his chest, should be compelled to sit the whole evening in that House, and he protested against it. Since, however, the noble lord seemed to be so urgent, he, with the leave of the House, would retire to some part of the House where he would have the benefit of free air, which he stood at that moment much in need of—at the same time that he would be perfectly within hearing of the noble lord.
 Mr. Brougham,  in explanation, observed, that the noble lord had misunderstood what he had stated on a former occasion respecting the Liturgy. A question had been started as to her majesty's title of queen. He had then stated, that havingher name in the Liturgy, or receiving addresses, were trifles light as air; for queen she was, and queen she must be. It was in this way, in comparison with her general rights, that he spoke lightly of the omission of her name in the Liturgy, and not at all with regard to that proceeding considered in itself. He much regretted the ground on which ministers had now placed the omission of her majesty's name. With regard to the return of her majesty, it was true he had advised her to suspend her journey until a courier could have been sent to London and return. Whether that advice was right or wrong, he trusted the House and the country would suspend their opinion until he could explain the grounds on which it was given. He never advised her majesty to refrain altogether from coming to this country. Had the negotiation on the return of the courier failed, it would then have been for him to consider what further advice he ought to have given. Much had been said about her majesty's advisers. He confidently believed that the only adviser of the step her majesty had taken in coming to this country was herself. It was a step which reflected infinite honour on his illustrious client. It could not have come so well from her legal advisers as it did
 1311
 Mr. Brougham  here interrupted the hon. member, in order to explain that what he had said was, that he had only recently learned that lord Hutchinson had received no instructions.
 Mr. Brougham  was hardly more surprised at the late declaration that the noble lord had acted without the authority of his majesty's ministers, than at the address of his hon. friend who had just sat down. So far from imputing dishonourable conduct to the noble lord, he had put in the same claim for him that he had for himself, and had voluntarily offered to vindicate his conduct. Whether such vindication could have rendered that of the hon. gentleman superfluous, it would not be for him to determine.
 Mr. Stuart Wortley  seconded the motion, and was persuaded that the House and the country could not desire a better
 1229
 Mr. R. Martin  said, that, seeing the House at that moment perfectly unoccupied, he hoped it would not be deemed presumptuous in him to attempt to arrest
 1247 1248
 Mr. Denman  said, that the observations which had fallen from the noble lord opposite had rendered it imperatively necessary for him to rise up in defence of the conduct of his hon. and learned friend and his own. With regard to the motion before the House, he thought be should ill discharge the duty which he owed to his illustrious client, were he to accede to the proposition of the hon. member for Bramber. He was by no means disposed to admit the refined distinctions which had been made between the duty which he owed to his client, and the duty which he was bound to perform as a member of parliament. It was impossible, indeed, to divest himself of those feelings of respect and duty which the confidence reposed in him by her majesty was calculated to inspire; but he saw not the smallest inconsistency in performing the duties of those separate capacities; for, he, would best defend the rights of the queen, who performed his duty best as an honest member of parliament. When, he considered upon what unequal terms the parties met, when he considered the power and influence with which the charges against her majesty had been brought forward, and the friendless and unprotected situation of her majesty, he thought there never was a case in which it became more imperiously the solemn duty of every honest man to stand forward as her advocate. He could not but allude to the situation in which he was himself most unexpectedly placed. He had never contemplated the possibility of being placed in the situation of a negociator upon so important an occasion, and no man could feel more strongly than himself his inadequacy to discharge its duties; but when he was told by the noble lord opposite, that his hon. and learned
 1268 1269 1270 1271 1272 ex-parte 1273 1274 1275
 Mr. Denman  assured the hon. gentleman he had not the slightest intention of offering a single observation reflecting upon the deservedly eminent character of his noble relative.
 Mr. Wilberforce  replied. In allusion to the charge or insinuation that he had any understanding with ministers in bringing this question forward, he solemnly disclaimed it, and conceived that his long political life might have secured him against such a suspicion. He had carefully looked for any means by which he could effect his purpose—that of adjusting this unhappy
 1313
 Mr. Wilberforce  rose, to make his promised motion. He said, be could assure the House, that notwithstanding he could not plead that he had been urged into this business against his wishes, he was fully sensible of the great task which he had undertaken. So aware, indeed, was he of the extreme importance of that task, that were at not from considerations of indispensable duty, he should almost be induced to shrink, from any further proceeding. He was cheered, however, by the hope, that kind support and indulgence from the House which he had
 1214 1215 1216 1217 1218 1219 1220 1221 1222 1223 1224 1225 1226 1227 1228
 Mr. Wilmot,  after stating the position in which the House stood, desiring these differences to be arranged by conciliatory means, rather than by public discussion, took a view of the negotiations, in which he observed her majesty's legal advisers had contended for four distinct points of concession:—1st. the acknowledgment of the queen  de facto; 1266 1267
 Sir Thomas Acland  supported the motion, and expressed his opinion that the original omission of the queen's name from the Liturgy was most useless and improper.
 Lord Castlereagh  perfectly recollected that the letter alluded to had been received by a noble friend of his. He wished, at the same time to observe, that when he spoke of the Liturgy having been introduced by her majesty's advisers as an after-thought, he meant not to insinuate that her majesty had not thought of it: his object was to show that it was not, in the first instance, propounded to his majesty's servants as a principal ground of objection. While he was on his legs, he wished to suggest the propriety of the House sitting to-morrow, in order to receive her majesty's answer; not for the purpose of deliberating upon it, but in order that gentlemen might be in possession of it previously to any discussion.
 Mr. Brougham  said, that nothing could be more convenient than such a proceeding, provided no discussion was to take place. He wished here to state, that in consequence of the late hour to which parliament sat last night, as well as from the indisposition under which he laboured, he was unable to make any communication to her majesty before three o'clock to-day. This having been the case, her majesty was unable to fix any earlier hour than eleven o'clock to-morrow for receiving the, deputation.
 Mr. Brougham  trusted the House would allow him to supply an omission which he had last night made in the course of his speech, and which had only been brought to his recollection by her majesty in the course of this morning. It had been objected by the noble lord last night, that the introduction of the question of the Liturgy had been an afterthought on the part of her majesty's advisers. Now, he felt himself bound, in justice to the queen, to state, that the moment her majesty, at her then residence abroad, found, from the gazette, that her name was erased from the Liturgy, she instantly wrote to one of his majesty's ministers*, complaining of the injustice of
 * " Rome, March "The Queen wishes to be informed, through the medium of lord Liverpool, first minister to the king, for what reason or motive the queen's name is left out of the general prayers in England, with a view to prevent all her subjects from paying her such respect as is due to her. And it is an equally great omission towards the king, that his consort queen should be obliged to submit to such great neglect, as if the archbishop was in perfect ignorance of the real existence of the queen Caroline of England. The queen is desirous that lord Liverpool should communicate this letter to the archbishop of Canterbury. Lord Liverpool will with difficulty believe how much the queen was surprised at this first act of cruel tyranny towards her; since she had been informed through the newspapers of the 22nd of February, that in the course of the debates in the House of Commons, lord Castlereagh, one of his best friends, assured the queen's attorney-general, that the king's servants would not use towards they queen any inattention or harshness. And after that speech of lord Castlereagh, the queen is surprised to find her name left Out of the Liturgy as if she no longer existed in this World. The queen trusts, before she arrives in England, these matters will be corrected, and that she will receive a satisfactory answer from lord Liverpool. "CAROLINE, Queen." 1318
 Mr. Denman  said, that the letter of her majesty, complaining of the omission Of her name in the Liturgy, had been written on the 16th March, and received here on the 29th. Of this letter he knew nothing, until informed of it by her majesty this morning.
 Lord Castlereagh  informed the noble lord, that his majesty's government did not intend to make any appointment in the place of the late Scotch baron to whom he alluded.
 General Fergusson  said;—As we are now about to
 1321
 Lord Castlereagh: —I hope the hon. and gallant general will excuse me on the present occasion for reminding him, that, when we agreed to meet today, it was specifically understood by my hon. friend opposite (Mr. Wilberforce), and I believe by others, that we were not to meet for discussion, but merely to receive the queen's answer. As we are to enter upon this subject on Monday, I hope it will not be expected of me now to say one word that can lead to premature discussion. I must therefore decline answering the hon. and gallant general's question at the present moment.
 Lord Castlereagh  declined giving any answer to any farther question.
 Mr. Martin  said, it was highly indecorous to be thus putting questions to the noble lord, especially when it was known to be the feeling of the House that there ought to be no discussion upon the subject at present.
 Lord A. Hamilton  begged to state, that one of the barons of the Scotch exchequer, called the English baron, had lately died. It was therefore his intention to move, on an early day, that the place just vacated should not be filled up, but that, agreeably to the recommendation of the committee on that subject, the barons of the Scotch exchequer should remain permanently at their present number.
 Mr. Brougham  said, he stood in the same situation as his hon. friend who had just sat down. His motion respecting the Education of the Poor stood also for Tuesday. He could not, however, when he considered the great importance of the subject, and that, if the business of the country was allowed to yield to circumstances which might arise like those his hon. friend had alluded to, the public must eventually be sufferers to a deplorable extent, bring himself to postpone his motion beyond the appointed day. He had always foreseen that the momentous proceedings which were about to take place, would be attended with consequences such as the hon. member for Durham and himself referred to. He saw no alternative, however, but that of persisting in the course he now stated, and suggesting to the House the propriety, during the progress of the interesting discussions in which it was about to be engaged, of setting apart particular days for attending to the regular business of the country.
 Mr. Lambton  begged the indulgence of the House for a few minutes. A motion of his, which he was pledged to his consti-
 1319
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  protested against the doctrine laid down by the noble lord, that his agreement with any hon. member was to be admitted as a bar to any inquiry which others might think proper to make. The question put by his hon. friend was a very proper one, and one to which the House had a right to expect an answer, although the noble lord need not answer it, certainly, unless he chose. But the sooner it was answered the better. The Milan commission must either have been the act of government, or have arisen out of underhand advice, to which the noble lord and his colleagues had found themselves obliged to truckle. If the noble lord and his colleagues thought these were acts that ought not to have taken place, they should gravely and respectfully have advised his majesty against them; and if their advice had been rejected, they ought immediately to have resigned their places to others [a laugh]. He did assure the gentlemen who had just indicated their feelings, that he spoke disinterestedly; for, so far from having a wish that his friends or the gentlemen who surrounded
 1322
 Sir R. Wilson  did not wish to provoke discussion, but he felt it necessary to ask the noble lord if the adjourned debate on the king's message would be resumed on Monday, or if it was intended by ministers to insist on the appointment of a secret committee? He asked for the purpose of obtaining information for his constituents, who were anxious to seize the opportunity, if any should offer, to express their objections to that mode of proceeding, by way of petition to the House.
 Colonel Palmer,  in offering himself to the notice of the House, was anxious to explain the motive of his conduct with respect to the question before it, and begged to be understood, in the vote he had given on the former night, to express no opinion whatever, as to the charges on the table; but without questioning the propriety of its decision, he could not concur in the resolution of the House, recommending to her majesty to make that concession which he could not, consistently with his own feelings, have made himself under the same circumstances.—If he thought that an inquiry into the charges would in any degree promote the honour or interests of the Crown, no individual could desire it more anxiously than himself; but it was from his conviction of the great arid inevitable injury that it threatened, and his perfect concurrence in the language of the resolution, that it must be derogatory to the honour of the Crown, and the dearest interests of the empire, that he considered it to be his bounden duty to oppose it. He considered such opposition to be still more the duty of those who voted for there-solution, who were bound not to express or act upon any opinion at variance with it. They had given her majesty credit for the justice of her feelings; and to persuade her to make the concession required, they assured her that it would not be considered as a wish on her part to avoid inquiry, or as proceeding from any motive whatever than a desire to comply with their wishes; but their bringing her to trial after this, would be a proof that
 1357 1358 1359
 Mr. Bathurst  said, he lamented the absence of the hon. and learned gentleman, though he knew he was called away by his duties, in another character, in another place. The appointment of a secret committee had been proposed because the subject of inquiry was of a most delicate nature, and because many circumstances might otherwise be divulged which would defeat the end of that inquiry. His noble friend had, however, now superseded this form of proceeding, by undertaking himself to bring forward some specific proposition. The House would know how-to defend itself against any charge of inconsistency in now entering upon inquiry after the expressions contained in their recent vote. It appeared to him that nothing could be more unfounded than such a charge. With respect to the assertion that ministers possessed no evidence that could support their case, he would put it to the general feeling of mankind, whether it was possible that any set of men could place, in the shape of a charge, and, what was much more, bring before parliament, matters of little or no importance? The hon. and learned gentleman had talked of the prejudices which would be excited against her majesty. In every judicial inquiry there was some prejudice excited. Whether the investigation preliminary to the specific charge were public or

 Mr. Western  rose for the purpose of entering his protest against the motion of the noble lord, and, in doing so, he would shortly state the reasons that induced him to come to this determination. He protested against the motion, because the effect of such a vote would be to pledge the House, directly or indirectly, to an approval of the measures pursued by the noble lord, with a view to the projected inquiry. The sense of the whole country was distinctly and evidently opposed to such an inquiry, and the sentiments of the House, when the subject was mentioned on the first night, were shown to be distinctly and decidedly contrary to any investigation of this green-bag. The noble lord bad, he thought, drawn a very incorrect inference from the decision of that evening, as well as from the subsequent decision on the resolution of the hon. member for Bramber, for which he had voted in common with the majority of the House. When the noble lord made the original motion, he laid this green-bag on the table, and called on the House for immediate inquiry. The House, however, decided when an alternative was held forth that it ought to be adopted in preference. Why had not that alternative been properly followed up? Had not the whole country expressed a clear and decided opinion that the inquiry was not fit to be gone into? The country had adopted that opinion, for this plain reason, because it appeared that the inquiry, which was at first described to be of a criminal
 1362 1363 1364
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that in calling the attention of the House to the situation in which it was placed, after the proceedings which were had at the close of the last week, and particularly after what had occurred at the last meeting of the House, and considering also that the order of the day relative to his majesty's message stood for discussion that night, he must fairly own to the House what was his opinion of their present situation. After all the efforts which had been made, and to which, he trusted, the House would consider that his majesty's government had lent itself with the utmost readiness and anxiety, he thought that the House would now feel that every hope which could have entered into his mind at any time, and in whatever degree he might have ventured to entertain that hope (although he had always expressed himself with the utmost caution as to the final result) lie thought that the House must now consider that every effort which had been made on the part of his majesty's government, and, what was more, upon the part of parliament itself, with the view of effecting an adjustment of compromise, had

 Mr. Wynn  said, he had felt it his duty to urge upon the House the necessity of catching at any thing which would be likely to adjust the present unhappy differences; but, unfortunately, the proposals of that House had been rejected, and they were now called upon to enter upon an inquiry. Differing, as he did, on many occasions, from those gentlemen who had spoken in opposition to the proposition of the noble lord, he nevertheless felt that the House would be guilty of great impropriety in agreeing to this adjournment. Let the House see how the case stood. A message, demanding the most solemn attention of the House, had been brought from the Crown, and the House had pledged itself to take that message into its immediate consideration. On the first day, the noble lord suggested the possibility of entering into some arrangement, and the House agreed to an adjournment for that purpose; but now the noble lord came and said, that he wished to bring the question before the House in another shape, and therefore requested an adjournment for that purpose. If ministers had brought down a message from the Crown, desiring the House to suspend their operations on the former message, the course to be pursued by the House would be clear; but, in the present case, he confessed he did not see how the House could suspend their operations, and allow the noble lord to bring the question under their consideration, in the way he had mentioned. If the secret committee had been appointed, and had not found that there was sufficient ground for inquiry, they might have felt it their duty to move for the censure of parliament, or perhaps they might have felt it their duty to impeach his majesty's ministers. He could not suppose that any man in his senses would come down to the House and prefer such serious charges, except on evidence which appeared,  prima facie 1381 prima facie
 Mr. Hobhouse  said:—Mr. Speaker; I fear, Sir, that, as almost every topic has been exhausted and every argument used which may appear material to those who advocate the opinions which I venture to
 1384 1385 sine quâ non, 1386 1387 1388 1389
 Mr. Western  stated, that if his motion was acceded to, it was his intention to follow it up with addresses to the king, and to her majesty also, the purpose of which would be, to promote a final and amicable adjustment upon this subject.
 Mr. Marryat  began by observing, that if revolutions  were 1397 1398
 Lord Nugent  said, he agreed with the amendment of his hon. friend, because he did not think that the delay would, as an honourable member bad thought, put a stop to the proceedings altogether. He objected to. the delay proposed by the noble lord, because it was proposed upon grounds offensive to his majesty, highly offensive to the queen, and subversive of the principles of public justice.
 1377 1378
 Mr. Tierney  said, the noble lord appeared to be in a more awkward situation than that in which he had been placed on a former occasion. He came forward apparently with the assumption, that whatever he proposed for adoption would be agreed to. He hoped the noble lord would find himself mistaken on the present occasion, as the subject was one of the most important that could be conceiv-

 Mr. Brougham  said, he entirely, and from the bottom of his heart, concurred in the concluding observations of the noble lord; and he implored all sides of the House at that moment, at the commencement of an inquiry now inevitable, not to let the spirit or the voice of party inter-
 1350 1351 tactique 1352 1353 1354 1355 ex parte, 1356 pro con.
 Mr. Brougham,  in a brief explanation, said, that all the delay wanted on the part of the queen was, a sufficient time to produce evidence to disprove the accusations against her. The import of the words in the negotiation which settled the basis on the ground that the one side should retract, and the other side admit nothing, had, he conceived, been mistaken. It had been, assumed that they meant that there should be no concession on either side; but if that had been their meaning, it would have been quite ridiculous for the commissioners to have met five times afterwards to endeavour to settle terms. All that they implied was, that neither of the parties should concede any thing inconsistent with their honour, but that the queen might concede, or the king, or ministers retract or concede any other points on which they might otherwise be disposed to insist.
 Mr. Stuart Wortley  said, that as his noble colleague bad clearly shown that the House was not reduced to the alternative of either withdrawing its support from the present advisers of the Crown or of proceeding immediately with the proposed inquiry, he did not feel it necessary to offer those remarks upon that subject which he certainly should have offered had it not been for the observations of his noble colleague. He would, however, assure his noble friend that though he supported the present administration on most occasions, from a conviction that the policy which they pursued was calculated to promote the best interests of the nation, he was still of opinion, that if the present unfortunate differences could be brought to a happy termination by their removal, they ought most unquestionably to be removed from their present
 1382 1383
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  said, he did not presume that the public had a right of thoroughfare through the Mews; he was only anxious to know, whether any steps were to be taken to remedy the inconvenience to the public.
 Mr. M. A. Taylor,  seeing an hon. friend of his in his place, begged to know whether it was the intention to re-open the king's Mews as a

 Mr. R. Martin  differed from the conclusion to which the right hon gentleman had arrived, when he declared that guilt would be proved against ministers, if they failed to establish the charges against the queen If government were satisfied of her innocence, he thought they were still bound to proceed with the charges in justice to her majesty. The ministers in this case he regarded as merely acting the part of the clerk of the Crown—they presumed no guilt—they merely laid the charges before the House that they might be met and refuted, while they in effect said to the accused party, "God send you a good deliverance." That the charges must now be proceeded with was clear, from, what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman himself, as be had demanded trial for her if she were guilty—acquittal if innocent. Under these circumstances the Crown must proceed to make out its. case He was not surprised at such a
 1376
 Mr. S. Whitbread  said, he objected entirely to the measures that had been pursued by ministers since her majesty's arrival in this country, and more particularly to the motion brought forward this day; because it appeared to him, that ministers, by proposing measure after measure, and scheme after scheme, were endeavouring to delude the House into some sort of sanction of what they had done. In opposing the resolution of his hon. friend the other night, he did so, not because he would interpose any bar to an amicable adjustment of their differences, but because, when that resolution was put into plain words, it amounted to this, that the queen should be requested to submit to a gross insult, which must have the effect of degrading her for ever. With the same feeling he now begged leave to second the amendment which had just been moved, and which, he felt no doubt, would be approved of by the country.
 Mr. Denman  said, that the only object of the queen was, to obtain an open public inquiry; that that was what her majesty distinctly applied for in her first communication to that House; and that that also was what she looked for in those terms of her answer to the resolutions of the House, where she spoke of an appeal to the public justice of the country. With respect to the motions before the House, as he and his colleague, in their address to the other House of Parliament that day had offered to submit the case of the queen to any mode of public inquiry which parliament might think proper to institute, he and his colleague felt it most becoming not to vote upon the present occasion. They were not, he begged it to be understood, at all adverse to inquiry; their only objection being to any secret investigation or private tribunal. But he could not help observing the new and singular grounds which were this night urged on the other side for prosecuting the proposed inquiry. The inquiry was, it seemed, now to be persisted in, not because her majesty had rejected the propositions made to her at St. Omer's, not because she had ventured to come to this country, not because the correspondence which had taken place respecting her in France had been published in the several journals, a, proceed-

 Mr. Huskisson  said, he was not able to give the hon. member any satisfactory information on the subject. The Mews was not in his department, but he understood that its being left open as a thoroughfare, was only by indulgence. He did not know whether it was or was not: to be re-opened.
 Mr. W. Smith  rose amidst general cries of question! As soon as the noise had in some degree subsided, the hon. member expressed his concurrence in the sentiment laid down by his hon. and learned friend, that this question was not a party question. He had voted for the address proposed by his hon. friend last week, because he was willing to adopt any mea-

 Mr. Wilberforce  expressed his regret that the advice of the House of Commons had been rejected, because he was convinced that if it had been followed, her

 Sir James Mackintosh  rose for the purpose of shortly stating his intention to postpone the further progress of some of the bills he had introduced into parliament in amendment of the penal code of this country.—In consequence of a conversation which he had had with the law officers of die Crown, he was aware of their intention to oppose three of these bills; and in the present state of public business, and when the mind of every member was occupied so deeply in the consideration of one unfortunate question, he should think it ill-became him to press forward those bills which were so important to the country He entertained a reasonable hope that there would be time in the course of the present session to terminate the subject, but for the present he should only move the second of those bills on which he did not anticipate opposition. The Limitation of Forgeries bill, the Repeal of the Statute act relative to Larceny, and the Navigable Rivers Robbery bill, were the three on which he expected opposition. The other three he hoped his learned friend the attorney-general would allow to pass their second readings, leaving the discussion on them to take place in the committee, on the bringing up of the report.
 Mr. Scarlett  considered the question now before the House as one of the first importance to the nation. He presumed that the hon. gentleman who had preceded him thought so too; but he certainly was at a loss to know, whether his hon. friend intended to support or oppose the amendment. He imagined that it must be his intention to support it; for, deprecating as his hon. friend had justly done, a secret inquiry, as prejudicial to the national character and honour, he took it for granted that his hon. friend would vote for a motion which would probably preclude any inquiry at all. The real question, in fact, was, whether a secret committee was to be instituted, or whether it was to be abandoned altogether? As he could not concur in the idea of a secret committee at any stage of the proceedings, he thought it his duty to give his support to any motion which tended to render it unnecessary. Now, the amendment of his hon. friend went directly to do away with the green bag and to prevent any exposure of its contents. He called upon the House to recollect the feeling which they had expressed when the first mention of these proceedings had been made to them. Such being, then their opinion, he asked what had since occurred to change it? An adjournment had been agreed to to give an opportunity for a reconciliation, which reconciliation had unfortunately not taken place. Though he
 1393 1394 1395
 Lord Milton  said, he could not but look upon the intended investigation as one pregnant with the most positive and absolute danger to the country. He thought, notwithstanding what had been hitherto done, that some means might be yet devised to spare the House and the country the pain which must necessarily arise from the disclosure of the alleged charges against her majesty. He said this the more because he did not think the House could be called upon to decide on charges except those of a public nature. He had listened attentively to the speech of the noble lord, and had expected that he would lay before the House such reasons as would justify them in instituting a public inquiry; but instead of that, he had been disappointed in seeing that the noble lord had not stated any thing in his speech to induce the House to advise such an investigation. The noble lord had spoken of the conflict between parties, but the noble lord did not propose that the inquiry should be entered upon on the ground of injury to public morals likely to ensue from the conduct of her majesty. From the silence of the noble lord on these points, he should be induced to suppose that the noble lord had proposed the inquiry upon private grounds, and not upon grounds of a public nature. If such were the motives which had induced the noble lord to call upon the House for a secret committee, he would implore the House to pause before they plunged the country into a state of danger which (after the humane, forcible, and philanthropic manner in which it had been pressed upon the House by the hon. member for Bramber), it would be absurd in him to describe. He would ask the House, whether it was wise or prudent, upon private grounds, to enter into
 1379 1380
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he had listened with much satisfaction to the perspicuous details given with so much ability by the hon. and learned gentleman. He was quite incapable of giving any opinion at present on the general merits of the proposed plan, but he should best discharge his duty by giving his consent to the bringing in of the bill, reserving to some future occasion the discussion of its principles. From the importance of the subject and the great interests involved in it, he hoped the hon. and learned gentleman would not press the bill during the present session. After the bill should have been brought in, it could be printed, and members would then be prepared for its discussion. He, at least, would give it his best attention.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  had listened to the hon. and learned gentleman's speech with the utmost attention, and expressed his opinion that the details which were presented in it rendered it more incumbent than ever upon the House to take the state of education throughout the country into their immediate consideration. Some of the plans, however, which the hon. and learned gentleman had proposed were totally inapplicable to Ireland. If he had not himself called the attention of the House, as he had promised
 90
 Mr. D. Brown  said, it was impossible by ordinary means to put down the disturbances that existed, and hence it was, that his hon. friend called upon the House to accede to his proposition for a select committee on the subject. It was well known unlawful oaths were every where administered, especially in the disturbed districts, and that nothing but the presence of the military preserved the public tranquillity.
 Mr. Charles Grant  perfectly agreed with the hon. mover in the extreme importance of the subject, not merely because it involved the character of the existing government of Ireland, but much more because it involved the consideration of the principle on which Ireland had been and ought to be governed. He (Mr. Grant) was certainly in a singular situation. He had felt it his duty already to state to parliament that there did not appear to the lord-lieutenant and the government of Ireland, to be any ground for proposing the renewal of the Insurrection act. And now an honourable gentleman rose, and with curious inconsistency complained that the Irish government was not alive to the state of Ireland, and at the same time proposed to enact a law which was, to give that government a discretion that they did not think it necessary to possess! He felt bound to oppose the motion; not merely because it was brought on so late in the session (although that, notwithstanding the explanation of the hon. gentleman, would have been sufficient); not merely because if the House were absolutely to go into a committee, the proposition of the honourable mover was not sufficiently extensive; as it did not include any inquiry into the local and general causes of the disturbances; not merely because he was hostile to the supposition of the hon. gentleman, that only what were called strong measures could be salutary; but because the bill which the hon. gentleman recommended was contrary to that principle on which, in his opinion, the government of Ireland ought to be conducted. Did the House recollect what were the provisions of the Insurrection act? Did they recollect that it forbad every person to be absent from his house from sun-set to sun-rise? Did they recollect that it established a perpetual

 Lord Castlereagh  said, that no man had a greater respect for the opinion of the right hon. gentleman who had just sat down than he had, because from his great local knowledge and experience he might be considered competent to form a correct judgment. He must, however, deny that there was any thing in the present state of Ireland to justify the introduction of such a measure under any modification. If Ireland was really in such a state as had been described by his right hon. friend (Mr. V. Fitzgerald), he could not help thinking that he was rather tardy in not coming forward until now that tranquillity had been restored under the authority of the law of the land. The Insurrection act was not a measure to be adopted upon a precautionary principle; it required the existence of insurrection to justify its introduction. It was, in fact, like the income tax, a measure, which, if adopted at a proper time, and with proper regulations, might be attended with the best effects, but which ought never to be introduced without the existence of an adequate necessity. Ireland was now in a tranquil state; and he thought it would be at once impolitic and uncalled for to select a moment of public quiet to bring into action a measure, the spirit of which was agreed, upon all hands, to be repugnant to the constitution, and which could only be warranted by an adequate state of public disturbance.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  maintained the expediency of the proposed inquiry, although it appeared to be resisted by the combined
 103
 Mr. Dawson  regretted, in common with his hon. friend, the inattention which had been paid to the general state of Ireland by the government, of which the right hon. gentleman formed so prominent a member. A great part of the session had now elapsed, and no notice had been taken of the nightly meetings, the outrages, and the bloodthirsty assassinations which had invaded the quiet of a whole province, and produced the loss of many lives. Had his hon. friend proposed an insurrection act at once, he should not have supported such a motion, because he was, generally speaking, averse to measures of violence rashly or hastily adopted. The evils of the state of Ireland at present originated, in a great degree, from those unavoidable circumstances in which she had been placed for a series of years past. The soldiery, scattered at a great distance from head-quarters, too often plundered the peasantry. This begat reprisals, and the peasantry rose in arms, or secretly avenged their wrongs by assassination. The Insurrection act was passed in 1807, with a view to prevent the necessity of employing the military. The danger now was greater; and yet any measure of this nature was declared by government to be unnecessary. Gentlemen who, like himself, were in the habit of supporting government, expected they should be protected by the government in their turn; and it was of greater importance to them that their dwelling should be protected, their repose undisturbed, and their lives unmenaced, than that any particular set of men should hold the reins
 102
 General Hart  wished his hon. friend would withdraw his motion, as it would only tend, if carried, to make the Irish people believe they were not looked upon as a portion of the British empire. Conciliation would do every thing for Ire-land; it would promote the union of the two countries; and he was happy to hear
 105
 Mr. Brougham  observed, that he had studiously abstained from any mention of Ireland throughout his address to the House, from a consideration of the state of religion in that country; and if the Dissenters in England bore any such proportion to the members of the Established Church, as the Catholics in Ireland did to those of that country, his views of the subject would have materially differed.
 Mr. Brougham  said, he had no wish to press so important a measure hastily through the House, as, independently of the advantages which would accrue from its discussion within doors, great advantages would also be gained by its discussion out of doors—he meant among the clergy of the establishment, and all who were in any way connected with it. If the sense of the House should appear to be in favour of passing his bill during the present session, he should certainly, speaking individually, be better pleased; but if the House should think that it ought to be delayed to a future occasion, he should cheerfully submit to such delay as to the House might appear most advisable.
 Mr. Brougham  rose. He said, he returned his best thanks for the candour and the kindness of both the hon. gentlemen, in allowing him the precedence; and now, without any further preface, he would at once enter upon the subject he wished to bring before the House. After a very Jong period of time employed upon its consideration, he had at length determined to bring forward a motion, which in his estimation, was second to none in its magnitude or its importance. Parliament had been for some time, indeed, occupied upon what might be vulgarly considered a topic of more importance, a question to which the most intense attention of the nation had been directed; but by the production of the plan which he was about to submit to parliament, he trusted, that

 Mr. Daly  rose to bring forward his promised motion. He expressed his regret that he was under the necessity of calling the attention of the House to the disturbed state of Ireland. There never was a period when the state of that country required a more prompt and vigorous interposition on the part of government; when the disturbances were so extensive, and the outrages of so violent and dangerous a character. He should abstain from entering into any topics which were likely
 92 93 94 95
 Mr. R. Martin  denied, that in the county of Galway there was any thing like a rebellion. In the baronies where his property was situated, every thing was tranquil, and he claimed their exception from the imputation. He opposed the motion, and recommended his hon. colleague to withdraw it, as the measure was unnecessary in the present situation of the country.
 Mr. Wellesley Pole  said, he felt it necessary to point out to his hon. friend, the member for Gal way, why he considered the measure of an Insurrection act perfectly unnecessary. The British House of Commons would always hear with surprise an application from Irish members to coerce their own country, by enactments abhorrent to the constitutional feelings of that House. It was remarkable, that although the Insurrection act had been passed in 1807, as a means of intimidating and keeping the spirit of insubordination in check, it had never been acted on, except in the district alluded to, although frequently applied for by local magistrates in other quarters of that country. The object of government at that period, and he then formed a part of it, was, to conciliate the feelings of the people, whilst they endeavoured to possess themselves of sufficient power to govern that country with tranquillity. Was the House prepared to strengthen the hands of the Irish government beyond even what that government considered necessary for its authority, and the preservation of the public tranquillity? He had been surprised at hearing from his hon. friend, that a whole province of Ireland was now in a state of insurrection. He believed it was no such thing. In fact, they themselves had admitted that, owing to the application of the Peace Preservation bill, the country had been restored to tranquillity. Under these circumstances, he conceived that no case had been made out for such an enactment, and he should therefore vote against the motion.
 Mr. Wilberforce  expressed the obligations which he felt to his hon. and learned friend for the exertions which he had made, not only in establishing the principles, but in explaining the details, on which his bill was founded. He was confident that those exertions would be productive of the greatest benefits to the community, and that too at no very distant period.
 Mr. W. Parnell  said that from the statements he had that night heard, he should have imagined that Ireland was in a state of universal disturbance; but the fact was, there had been some disturbance in Gal-way, and they were now called upon for more rigorous measures, after the lenient proceedings of government had had their proper and full effect.
 Sir James Mackintosh  said, that he had read with great satisfaction the report of the education committee, and had heard with still greater satisfaction the measure which his hon. and learned friend had founded upon it. Having been himself alluded to in the course of the observations which had been made upon this subject, he would assert, that though he might be considered a speculatist, yet he was no visionary on the subject of education. He did not intend to trouble the House with many observations on it at present; but he could not help making one observation which had been repeatedly forced upon his notice during his residence in a distant part of the British empire. He had repeatedly had occasion to remark that morality if not produced, was at least best preserved, amongst those of our soldiers and sailors who were possessed of the power of communicating with their relations in Europe by means of writing. It was a truth so obvious, that there was no need for him to waste words in dilating
 91
 Sir J. Newport  also remarked on the deficiency of education, and the necessity of bestowing it on the people of Ireland. He was sorry that the act for numbering the population had not been sooner put into force, because that, by showing the extent of the want, it would have brought the House so much nearer to the accomplishment of that object. He considered that in any measure of this sort as applied to Ireland, it should be distinctly borne in mind that the great majority of the nation were of a different religion from that of the state.
 Sir J. Newport  expressed his satisfaction at being able for once to support the conduct of the executive government with regard to Ireland. He begged leave to remind his right hon. friend, that though Mr. Grattan had supported the Insurrection act generally in the then state of the country, he had repeatedly divided the House on that very clause of domiciliary visits to which it was now proposed that the act should be limited.
 Lord John Russell  rose for the purpose of submitting his promised motion relative to the production of a copy of the memorial presented by a native of Parga to the secretary of state. He was perfectly aware, that at the present time of the year, so near the conclusion of the session, and in the present agitated state of the public mind, it was extremely difficult for him to engage that attention which he could wish to circumstances occurring in a distant country, and not at all connected with that one paramount and domestic object which at present entirely occupied the public mind; but at the same time, he felt it his duty to urge this momentous subject, as one well-deserving the attention of parliament; and he thought that they were bound to give to the people of Parga that protection, which was not only a valuable right, and one to be extended, in such a case, of all others, but which could alone be their safeguard from the further continuance of those abuses and that oppression under which they at present laboured. The House would not expect that he should now enter into a detailed view of the question as to the cession of Parga. Would to God that he could enter into it with such effect as to be able to induce the House to commiserate the fate, and to relieve the situation, of a wronged and gallant people! Notwithstanding all the attempts which had been made by an anonymous writer to colour the transactions which had betrayed them, and to gloss over the counsels which had achieved their ruin, he thought the general opinion of mankind would be, that this was a case of as notorious treachery and as grievous injury, as any that had ever yet occurred in the world. And what had been the consequence, as regarded our own reputation? Our enemies always alluded with extreme anxiety to the case of Parga, as an instance of our acquiescence in oppression, and our desertion of the cause of freemen; and they reproached us with this fatal inconsistency—that we, who for ages, and throughout protracted wars, had stood forward as the champions of the rights of nations, were content, when the enemies of the Parguinotes required their submission, and the surrender of their rights, to act in a very different character, and upon principles contrary to those on
 107 l. l. l. 108 109
 Mr. Goulbum  congratulated the House, that after two or three years of misrepresentations, invented with art and circulated with industry, the time was not far distant when the documents to be laid upon the table of parliament would lay the whole case regarding Parga fairly before the country. The House would then be able to judge whether the resignation of this island was, as had been asserted, an act of grievous treachery, or whether, on the contrary, it had not been inevitable, if any regard was to be paid to positive and distinct engagements. The whole of the speech of the noble lord afforded the strongest confirmation that he himself entertained some doubt upon the question. If the case of Parga manifestly and indisputably reflected disgrace on the British government, would the noble lord have thought it necessary to wander about in search of subsidiary matter not really and fairly connected with the point at issue, but relating to the whole government of the Ionian islands? The talents and dexterity of the noble lord would not have been so exerted, had he not been sensible that he must find something or other to bolster up a bad case. The noble lord had alluded to certain anonymous statements recently published regarding Parga but he gave the noble lord credit for being unconnected with other anonymous statements elsewhere printed, which had led to that refutation. He maintained that the British government had not restored Parga to Turkey, without being fully satisfied that the latter had an indisputable right to the island; and he proceeded to prove his assertion by reference to the treaty of Campo Formio, by which it had been first made over to France, and subsequently relinquished to Turkey. The war between France and the Porte broke out in 1798, and the joint fleets of Russia

 Lord J. Russell,  in reply, said, that as the inhabitants of Parga had surrendered themselves on the understanding that they should follow the fate of the Ionian isles, he still thought faith had not been kept with them. If the great powers at the congress of Vienna had acted as they professed, on the principle of restitution, he should have been satisfied. Venice would then have been restored, and Parga would have been put under the

 Mr. Maxwell  presented a petition from Benjamin Wills, honorary secretary to the provisional committee for the encouragement of industry, praying that parliament would take some steps to provide the people with proper employment, and thus prevent them from falling into that state of degradation which must inevitably ensue, if they were not able, by their labour, to support themselves.
 Mr. Maxwell,  in rising to move for a select committee to inquire imto the nature of the distress by which the Cotton Weavers were affected, and to consider whether there was any practicable mode by which assistance could be extended to them, felt it necessary to make a few observations explanatory of his reasons for bringing forward a partial motion. When the whole community were suffering, and the manufacturing districts were plunged in such a state of misery as was now presented—when individuals were unable to procure employment, and found it wholly impossible to maintain themselves—he felt that he should have grossly neglected his duty, if he had not before the close of the session called the serious attention of government to the distress that prevailed. If they could not do away that distress altogether, they might, perhaps, devise some means by which it might be alleviated. The table had been covered with statements, both from the workpeople themselves, and from the magistrates, detailing to that House and to the government, the extent of the misery that prevailed. They admitted that great irritation existed; but they traced that irritation to the severe privations to which the lower classes of the community had unfortunately been too long exposed. He was astonished that ministers, who had extended relief to particular individuals, and even to the throne itself, should have overlooked these frequent calls. The distress which they had endeavoured to avert could not for a moment be placed in competition with that which he had described. When a motion for a committee to consider the state of the manufacturing population was

 Mr. Robinson  observed, that it was tolerably well known he was no advocate for parliamentary reform and he was the less so, because he was unwilling to convert the House into a college of disputants. But his hon. friend seemed disposed, from the variety of subjects to which he had adverted, to render the committee he proposed quite an arena for disputation, and the very first point which he would have this committee discuss was an abstract idea. That a committee might be useful and essential in collecting and arranging facts and information he was ready to admit, but this was, he believed, the first time it was proposed to refer to a committee the discussion of an abstract idea. The hon. member's professed object was, to benefit the cotton manufacturers, but how that was to be done by such taxes as he pro-
 122
 Mr. Maxwell,  after a short reply, consented to withdraw his motion until the next session. The motion was accordingly withdrawn.
 Mr. Ricardo  said, that he conceived the duty of government to be, to give the greatest possible development to industry. This they could do only by removing the obstacles which had been created. He complained therefore of government on very different grounds from the hon. mover, for his complaint was against the restrictions on trade, and other obstacles of that description, which opposed the development of industry. The recommendations of the hon. mover were inconsistent with the contrast between one class and another. If government interfered, they would do mischief and no good. They had already interfered, and done mischief by the poorlaws. The principles of the hon. mover would likewise violate the sacredness of. property, which constituted the great security of society.
 Mr. Goulburn  denied that the Parguinotes were not paid the whole sum promised them.
 Mr. Goulburn  said, that that circumstance admitted of an explanation.
 Mr. Lockhart  opposed the motion, conceiving that its adoption would only serve to hold out false hopes, which might probably induce the agriculturists and other classes of the people whose distress was quite equal to that of those for whom the hon. mover was an advocate, to make similar applications to that House. He particularly deprecated the hon. member's proposition to tax absentees, for such a tax would most probably urge those to take away their capitals from this country who at present only spent their incomes in (other nations, and the capital once taken away was by no means likely to return. He disagreed with the plans of spade-husbandry, and others, which had been proposed, because they all appeared on a nearer view to be futile. The House at any rate could not grant a committee until some of those plans should be found effectual, by the experience of people out of doors. Besides, if the House granted a committee to the cotton weavers, the agricultural labourers, and almost all others, would have an equally good claim to consideration, and would scarcely fail to urge it. Time alone and patience, which he doubted not the people would show, could cure the difficulties under which they laboured.
 Mr. Hume  observed, that, feeling as he did for the condition of a people who had been compelled to remove from their native homes, he hoped the House would excuse him for offering a few observations on the subject. He admitted that Parga stood in need of some protecting power, and had been for a long time dependent on the Venetian republic. The treaty of Tilsit had, however, as he conceived, distinctly conveyed it by name, with the other Ionian islands, to France. It afterwards fell into our hands by conquest and the treaty of 1815. This at least was the general understanding; and the impression of the Parguinotes themselves certainly was, that they were to share in the fate of the other islands. With respect to the officer alluded to by the hon. gentleman opposite to have raised expectations in the minds of the people of Parga which could not fairly be fulfilled, he must say, that he had the pleasure of being acquaint-

 Mr. Hume  said, he rested on the proclamation of the governor of the 19th of June, stating that 113,000 l.
 Mr. Chetwynd  rose to move for leave to bring in a bill to abolish the punishment of Whipping Female Offenders in any case whatever. The House was aware, that by an act of the year 1817, the system of public whipping of females had been wholly exploded; but he was surprised that the private whipping of females had been by that measure permitted to continue, looking on it as he did as objectionable, or even more objectionable than the other. It might be said, in defence of its continuance, that it was necessary for the sake of example; but, on the other hand, as the infliction of the punishment was private, it was in the power of the gaoler or other superintendant to render it the most excruciating torture possible, or a mere matter of form; and this alone he thought a decided objection to it. With respect to the public whipping of females, he was of opinion that no exhibition could be more revolting to the feelings. The act to which he had alluded only abolished the punishment of the public whipping of females; but if the House would agree with him, they would go much further. His intention was to move for leave to bring in a bill to repeal that act, and substitute other provisions for the more effectual prevention of the whipping of females; and the object of it would be to prohibit that practice, not only in the cases already provided for, but in workhouses, houses of correction, lunatic asylums, and other places for the reception of lunatics. If, therefore, the House should be of opinion that it should in no case be permitted, he should humbly move for leave to bring in a bill to abolish the punishment of whipping female offenders in any case whatever.
 Sir Robert Wilson  said, his opinion bad always been, that it was impossible, considering the situation of Parga, for us to keep possession of it. That possession must be deemed as offensive to Turkey, as Dover in the hands of the French would be to us, or Calais in our possession to the French. What he complained of and lamented was, that England should have charged itself with the odious responsibility of the cession. When that proceeding, however, was adopted, the most scrupulous care should have been taken to secure to the inhabitants the full value of their property. There was at present every reason to believe that the Parguinotes were dissatisfied; that they did not think they had received the protection which had been promised to them; and that our character had suffered in the eyes of Europe.
 Mr. Davies Gilbert , in alluding to the matter of the petitions took occasion to offer a few remarks upon the subject of turnpike-roads generally. Every hon. gentleman must be aware of the national importance of a good and perfect system for the regulation and management of roads. When he mentioned that, in the instance now more immediately before the House, an extent of no less than 136,000 acres was appropriated entirely for public roads, they would at once see how highly desirable it was that their construction and arrangement should be con-

 Mr. Robinson  argued against the policy of making these bounties permanent. He objected strongly to the second resolution which recommended the imposition of a duty of 28 s.

 Lord Castlereagh  presented the following Message from the King:

 125 G.  R.
 Sir J. Newport  said, he meant to move a clause in this bill, which he conceived of great importance. It was one which would prevent Irish masters in Chancery from sitting in parliament, while they held such office. The duties of a master in chancery in Ireland were such, that if in parliament, either the one or the other must be neglected [Hear!]. The public duties which devolved on a master in chancery, ought not to be neglected to favour the ambitious views of any individual. The right hon. baronet proceeded to quote various authorities, among others, the lord chancellor of Ireland and the master of the rolls, in support of his statement, that the public business of his office required every moment which an Irish master in chancery could by possibility devote to it. One master in chancery had stated, that the fees of his office had increased in the proportion of five and a half to one. But being asked whether there was a proportionate increase of business? he answered "Yes, where I was formerly employed for one hour, I am now employed four or five." The lord chancellor was of opinion, that all the witnesses in matters going before masters in chancery, ought to be examined, if it could be done without injury to public business, by the masters themselves, but this being found impossible, the examination devolved on other persons. He would add another piece of evidence which he held to be conclusive. On the examination of Mr. Ellis himself the following question was put to him:—"Can you state the particular time the duties of your office occupy?" Answer—"The duties of my office require a regular attendance for ten months in the year; and there is to be performed more or less business every day in the year, if attended to." Now then this officer declared that the duties of his office, if attended to,
 126
 Lord Castlreagh  said, he entirely concurred with the right hon. baronet in his conclusion. If the office of master in chancery was not a judicial office, it yet so nearly pertained to a judicial office, that any time devoted to other avocations, to the injury of the business of suitors, would operate as an infraction of the duty of that office. The grounds on which a master of chancery in England sat in that House were different from those on which an Irish master in chancery could sit there. An English master in chancery might sit in that House without any inconvenience to suitors, and without the neglect of the duties of his office. He had no objection whatever, therefore, to the general principle laid down; but he understood that an election was now pending for the city of Dublin, in which a master in chancery was one of the candidates, and he thought that the clause proposed ought not to operate as an  ex post facto
 Sir John Newport  said, that if it was manifest that the duties of a master in chancery were incompatible with his attendance as a member of parliament, that officer ought not to be allowed to hold a seat in that House. Could any man doubt but that by his attendance in that House the duties of his office would be neglected? That officer was bound to attend ten months in the year in Dublin; he had sworn that it was necessary so to attend. Would any member attempt (if he took his seat in that House) to propose an address to the Crown to remove him? He saw no reason why the legislature in this instance should forego giving that protection to the suitors which they were clearly entitled to; he saw no reason why, in compliment to the officer in question, the business of the Court of Chancery should be delayed, or the suitors of that
 127
 Mr. Shaw  said, that the clause proposed would operate as a great hardship on Mr. Ellis, who was at present a candidate for Dublin. The election would possibly be over before he could receive any information as to the proposed law. The hardship would be not merely on Mr. Ellis, but on the citizens of Dublin. The present contest was one of the most acrimonious and violent that had been remembered for a long time in that city. There was more of party spirit and personal hostility displayed than had been exhibited on any late contest. It would be a great misfortune to the electors if, after closing a contention of that kind, they should be driven to a new contest, which would possibly be carried on in the same way. Mr. Ellis, when he offered himself to the electors, had no notice of the clause now proposed; he thought, therefore, that he ought to be exempted.
 Mr. Abercromby  begged to call the attention of the House to the subject upon which they were about to legislate. It had nothing to do with the Dublin election, but was in plain terms whether or no parliament would continue to afford suitors in the Irish Court of Chancery that protection to which the law had entitled them. Nobody had ventured to state that the office of a master in chancery and a member of parliament were compatible. The very gentleman whose case was supposed to be involved in the present consideration had himself given conclusive testimony upon that point. He had declared that the business of his office required his full attendance for ten months in the year. Could any man after such a declaration, and with a consciousness of the importance of the duties of such an office, require an exception to be made in favour of a gentleman who had himself shown the impossibility of making it with any sense of justice? The hon. gentleman opposite had asked the House, on behalf of the citizens of Dublin, not to accede to this clause. If he asked that on behalf of the citizens of Dublin, he (Mr. Abercromby) would ask for the clause on behalf of the whole people of Ireland, who, if it did not pass, would be deprived of
 128 ex post facto
 Sir M. W. Ridley  could not help remarking upon the observation that this clause, if passed, would be productive of great inconvenience to the citizens of Dublin, by exposing them to a repetition of an election contest. To this he would answer, that there was no necessity whatever of their being so exposed; for if the election was concluded in favour of the gentleman alluded to, he could take his seat, and obviate all the inconveniences by the resignation of his office as master in chancery. To give him the option was no hardship upon him; he Could either retain the seat or the office; he could not expect that he or any other public officer would be permitted to retain a situation the duties of which he could no longer perform.
 Mr. Fowell Buxton  begged to know from the noble lord, before he gave his vote, whether, if Mr. Ellis should be elected, the noble lord would advise his majesty to dismiss him from his office, as he had declared that it was incompetent for that officer at once to discharge the duties of his office and to sit in that House?
 Mr. Canning  said, he understood his noble friend to say, that the instruction before the House ought not to have the effect of influencing the election now pending. If Mr. Ellis were elected, the effect of the instruction might be to negative the return. His noble friend did not say that a master in chancery should not be incompetent to sit or vote in parliament.
 129
 Sir J. Newport  said, that the object of the clause was to prevent any person from being capable of sitting or voting in parliament so long as he continued to hold the office of master in chancery.
 Mr. Canning  said, that in that case there was no difference of opinion.
 Sir J. Newport  said, that the officer in question would not be allowed to sit or vote so long as he continued to hold his office.
 Mr. Canning. —But the election will be good.
 Sir George Hill  said, that the effect of the instruction would be, to disqualify a gentleman from sitting in parliament, without any notice having been given to him of such a measure, and without any disqualifying law having previously existed. The object of the instruction, as explained by the right hon. baronet, was, to prevent Mr. Ellis from sitting or voting in that House [Cries of No, no!]. If he were wrong, he could be corrected, but he understood the resolution went to disqualify Mr. Ellis to sit or vote in that House, unless he gave up his office [Hear, hear!]. He would say that this was the first time pending an election of great expectation, that a measure was proposed in parliament to conclude that election. Was it the intention to dismiss Mr. Ellis, and to substitute Mr. Grattan in his place? Mr. Ellis was qualified in all respects to sit in that House. Extraordinary interest was excited at the election. Would the House disqualify an individual who might receive the favour of the citizens of Dublin? He considered such an act an outrage on the constitution, on fairness, and on candour.
 Sir James Mackintosh  said, he was at a loss to think how gentlemen could reconcile to any respect for the constitution—to fairness—to candour, or to common sense, the idea of enabling a man to occupy two places, which by his own confession, were absolutely incompatible. It was said that parliament had not given notice to the learned gentleman of the present measure; true, but he had given notice to the parliament that he could not possibly sit in that House without neglecting his duties. The right hon. baronet had said that there was a novelty about the
 130
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that he understood there was but one opinion in the House, either as to the incompatibility of the two situations of master of chancery in Ireland and member of parliament, or as to the impropriety of disturbing an election now in progress. All that was desired was, that the individual now a candidate for the city of Dublin should beat liberty, if elected, to resign his office.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  suggested, that the object of the clause would be more precisely marked if the words of
 131
 Mr. Calcraft  thought that, although the right hon. gentleman's amendment might meet the circumstances of the case immediately in view, it would not provide a sufficient regulation for all future cases, in which the office in question was, to disqualify in the first instance.
 Mr. Wynn  also observed, that the pending election would probably have terminated before notice was received in Dublin of the present resolution of the House. It should therefore, be made applicable to future cases.
 Colonel Barry  opposed it, because it appeared to him to be levelled at an individual. The right hon. baronet had thought proper, at the present moment, when it was probable the individual alluded to was actually a member of the House, to introduce a clause personally affecting that gentleman. He did not complain of the principle of the clause, but he thought that an  ex-post facto
 Sir J. Newport  defended the clause. Mr. Ellis knew that he could not perform the double duties of master in chancery and member of parliament; why, therefore, did he set up for the representation of the city of Dublin? The present clause was forced upon them by his own act.
 Mr. Daly  observed, that the bill which had passed this House last year, and was thrown out in the Lords, was without any such clause as that now proposed. This circumstance proved that it was an  ex-post fasto
 Dr. Phillimore  thought it would be a gross injustice to the suitors in chancery, if the same individual were allowed to act as master and member of parliament. The duties of a master in

 Dr. Lushington  said, that Mr. Ellis being a master in chancery, had taken an oath faithfully to perform the duties of his office, to do which, according to his own evidence, it was necessary that he should be in Dublin during ten months in the year. They should not, by allowing Mr. Ellis to retain the two situations, put him under the temptation of neglecting the duty of the one or the other, which no honourable man would wish to be subjected to. Besides, were they to forget the public in this case? A master in chancery had important duties to perform; the management of bankrupts' affairs, &c. which required attendance from day to day; so that every hour he was absent in England was injurious, and might be ruinous to the suitors. If no such bill was before the House, he thought one should have been introduced to protect the chancery suitors of Ireland.
 Mr. Nolan  considered the clause an  ex post facto
 Mr. R. Martin  meant to vote for the clause, which did not disqualify this gentleman from sitting in the House of Commons, if that were his wish. According to his oath, he could not fulfil the duties of the two situations; and, therefore, it was necessary that one of them should be given up. If a precedent were allowed in this case, the four other masters might also be returned to serve in parliament, and thus the whole business of the court of chancery would be stopped.
 Mr. Williams  said, if this clause went to exclude Mr. Ellis from the court of chancery, or from the House of Com-
 133
 Colonel Barry  observed, that all the arguments had been addressed to the principle of the clause, and nothing had been said as to its being an  ex post facto l
 Sir J. Newport  said, the gentleman alluded to had purchased the office, under a special notification from lord chancellor Ponsonby, who felt the impropriety of the purchase or sale of such situations, that it was intended to alter the system. With respect to the charge alleged against him for introducing this provision now, he could only say, that it had all along been his intention to propose it, whenever the bill arrived at its present stage. If the House felt it necessary to except Mr. Ellis from the operation of the clause, he hoped government would provide for him in some manner, so as to enable him to give up the situation of master in chancery, that the suitors might not be injured by his absence.
 Mr. Martin  said, that after Horne Tooke had been elected a member of that House, a bill had been passed which disqualified him.
 Mr. Nolan  observed, that none of the great disqualification acts were allowed to operate until the ensuing session of parliament.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  said, a manifest distinction existed between the present
 134
 Mr. Wrottesley  said, a seat in parliament was a trust, not an office. It was, therefore, a question between Mr. Ellis and his constituents, because the lord chancellor of Ireland would see that business of Mr. Ellis's office was attended to. If the House took upon it to legislate in the case of every person returned to the House who might not be able to attend, they would be obliged in consistency to exclude many of their members who were generals in the army, and had commands abroad, for instance at the Cape and in India, so that they could not attend at all.
 Mr. Baring  said, the learned gentlemen seemed to have forgotten that the office in question was one of permanent duty; whereas the avocations of the army and navy were not so. Officers were frequently enabled to attend to their duties in parliament, without interfering with professional matters; but Mr. Ellis's employment required attention from day to day. With respect to its being a mere question between his constituents and himself, he differed entirely from the learned gentleman. It did not follow, because his constituents were satisfied, that that House should also be satisfied; because there were important duties to be performed by that House which must be neglected if an individual resided in a distant part of the country.
 Sir J. Yorke  supported the clause.
 Lord Palmerston  said, that the argument of Mr. Wrottesley had not been answered. There was no effectual distinction between a command in the army
 135
 Mr. M. Fitzgerald  maintained, that the clause proposed by his right hon. friend was not liable to any of the objections which applied to a retrospective or  ex post facto
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that he was an advocate for the principle of the clause, upon the ground that attendance in parliament was incompatible with the duties of an office which required almost perpetual attention in Ireland. He was, indeed, an advocate for the clause upon the same ground that the judges were excluded from that House, which was not because they were supposed dependent upon the Crown, but because, from the pressure of their judicial engagements, the two situations were incompatible. Still he thought that this clause should not be retrospective with regard to any masters in chancery which might be elected previous to the passing of the act. But should the gentleman alluded to be returned, it would, of course, be competent to any member of that House to move an address to the throne for his removal from the office which he held in the court of chancery, and upon that address being presented it would be difficult, he thought, for any minister, with that gentleman's own evidence before him, to hesitate about
 136
 Mr. Abercromby  supported the clause. The observations made on the other side, with regard to officers of the army and navy holding seats in that House, had, in his view, no analogy to the present case; for a seat in parliament was to such an officer but a secondary consideration, while a master in chancery, in becoming a member of that House, was but too likely to make that his primary object, through which, of course, his official business would be neglected.
 Sir J. Newport  assured the committee that he had no personal motive whatever on this occasion, as he had the greatest personal respect for Mr. Ellis, and as he had mentioned to a friend of his, then in the House, before the death of Mr. Grattan, that it was his intention to move the insertion of a clause of this nature in the bill under consideration.
 Mr. Foster  objected to the proposed attempt to defeat the wishes, and to interfere with the franchises of the people of Dublin. He called upon the committee to recollect the precedent in the case of Home Tooke, where the act excluding persons in holy orders from that House, specially provided for the exception of that gentleman during the existing parliament, on the ground that it should not be retrospective in its operation, although that act was actually brought forward in consequence of Mr. Tooke's election.
 Mr. Macdonald  observed, that Mr. Tooke had no option, as he could not divest himself of his orders, and that he had no duty to perform elsewhere, by the neglect of which the public would suffer, while Mr. Ellis was in quite different circumstances, as he had a complete option.
 Mr. Foster  remarked, that the object then was, to force Mr. Ellis to give up his office.
 Mr. R. Smith  said, that Mr. Ellis had, by his own admission, such official business to discharge as rendered it impossible for him to attend his duty as a member of that House. Therefore, should that gentleman be returned, an address to the Crown ought to be voted for his removal from office, and if no other person would make the motion, he should himself feel it his duty to do so.
 Mr. Ricardo  considered bounties given to Ireland in this way, as in the nature of a tax on the people of this country, and therefore he was generally opposed to such measures.
 Mr. Sumner  presented petitions from certain Trustees of Roads in Kent and Surrey against the Metropolis Roads bill. The hon. member hoped that the bill would be read a second time, printed, and allowed to stand over to next session.
 Mr. Hume  concurred in the view taken by Mr. Robinson, and hoped his hon. friend would withdraw the second resolution. He urged the propriety of allowing the same drawback on ashes used in bleaching in Scotland and England as was allowed in Ireland.
 Dr. Phillimore  brought up the report of the committee on the Marriage Act Amendment bill. Dr. Lushington moved as an amendment, that the report be recommitted. Mr. Warren seconded the amendment. Dr. Dodson and Mr. D. Gilbert spoke in favour of the re-committal, and after a reply to their arguments from Dr. Phillimore, the House divided, when there appeared, For the reception of the Report, 47; Against it, 23: Majority, 24. The report was then received.
 Mr. Huskisson  said, that every principle of justice required that the other parts of the empire should be put on the same footing, as to bounties, with Ireland.
 Mr. Chetwynd , after some observations in favour of the bill, recommended the adoption of a clause, substituting a definite punishment for that which this bill proposed to repeal, namely, confinement for some period not more than two years, or less than six months.
 Sir G. Hill  regretted that this question should have been agitated in the present session.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  observed, that as this bill had been three times before the House, being twice carried in silence, and once with a majority of two to one in his favour, he could not be expected to offer any thing new upon the subject; but he felt it necessary to repeat, that nothing could be farther from his intention, than to cast the slightest imputation upon the judges, because he felt, from the conduct of those exalted magistrates, that no imputation could fairly attach, nor did he mean to take away from them any discretion but that which they never exercised. From the manner, then, in which the judges generally exercised their discretional power, he could not think it necessary to prescribe the limits recommended by his hon. friend.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  felt persuaded, that the adoption of his hon. friend's amendment would not recommend this bill to a more gracious reception in the other House of Parliament.
 Sir J. Mackintosh , in rising to move the committal of the Privately Stealing in Shops bill, said, he should make no observations in the present state of the measure, but reserve himself for the committee, which, after the admission of the principle by the House, was the proper place for the discussion of any objections which might be made to the several clauses. He hoped that any objections which might be entertained to any part of the bill, would be brought forward in the committee, in order that he might have a convenient opportunity of answering them, and not be postponed to any subsequent stage. Upon this, indeed, he was induced to calculate, as he had so often deferred the progress of the bill, at the request and for the accommodation of those gentlemen who were understood to entertain some doubts upon the subject.
 Sir J. Yorke  observed, that as the hon. and learned gentleman avowedly took up these measures in imitation of the example of sir Samuel Romilly, he ought to recollect the fate of that gentleman's propositions in the other House, and not to pursue a course on this occasion, which, however creditable to his heart, did not appear creditable to his head.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  wished to know, whether the committee intended to propose any remedy of the grievance which was felt in the renewal of turnpike trusts, even for a limited period. The expense of such a proceeding amounted at present to 112 l

 Mr. Bernal  objected to the bill, as he thought the volunteers to the number of 800 wholly needless.
 Sir W. Curtis  said, that this was the first time he bad heard that any troops had been in the city on Friday last. He had

 Mr. Alderman Wood  observed, that he felt called upon to set the House and the country right regarding the soldiery in the city. Certain it was that a considerable body of life-guards had been called out on Friday last, and perhaps their horses heads might be in the city, and their tails out of it: one of them, fully armed, had come to Guildhall for orders; and the lord mayor had avowed that the military were summoned by his orders. It was not easy to see any necessity for such a proceeding, since no breach of the peace had been committed or contemplated: the meeting was most unanimous, and nothing was more unlikely than a disturbance.
 Lord Lowther  said, that he held in his hand a printed petition presented on a former day by an hon. gentleman complaining of the conduct of three magistrates of Carlisle: he wished to know what course the hon. gentleman intended to pursue, as the individuals concerned were very reluctant that such unfounded calumnies should go forth without the means of refuting them. His lordship hoped that the subject would not be postponed until the next session.
 Lord Lowther  regretted that the question was to be postponed, as the accusations were perfectly groundless and unjust.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that in calling the attention of the committee to the message of his majesty, he was happy to state that the votes, seven in number, which he had to propose, were such as would meet with the unanimous concurrence of the

 Lord Castlereagh  said, he was sure that the surprise of the House would have been much greater than that expressed by the noble lord, if ministers had comedown and proposed a settlement for her majesty, considering the situation in which she at present stood. The noble lord had made three distinct charges against ministers—1st, they were charged with not providing funds sufficient to enable her majesty to enter on her defence; next, with having committed a breach of the law, in granting sums of money not sanctioned by parliament; and, lastly, with having neglected to make a proposition to parliament relative to a provision for her majesty, it having been notified that such a proposition would be submitted to the House. Now, with respect to any practical inconvenience connected with the first point, he could assure the House that every means had been taken to obviate it. Every care had been taken to prevent any personal inconvenience which might be likely to affect her majesty. Provision had been made to meet any particular expense which the queen might incur in consequence of the pending inquiry. That was a point which he could assure the noble lord had neither escaped the king, nor been lost sight of by his ministers. It had been specifically notified to her majesty that every means would be afforded to her

 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that provision would not only be made for the usual support of her majesty, but that a sum would also be granted to meet any expenses that might arise during the pending investigation. Her majesty was provided for by the vote of that House up to the 5th of July, and it would be time enough for the noble lord to complain when he found ministers disbursing the public money without any legal authority.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that on the part of the Crown every thing would be done to facilitate her majesty's proceedings; and, with respect to the foreign powers, they would, he conceived, feel it to be a point of character to give her every assistance in their power.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he was not prepared to answer the question.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  replied, that he did not know, and it was not his duty to know whether such a paper existed.

 Mr. Bernal  wished to know from whom he was to receive official information upon this subject, if not from the chancellor of the exchequer.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  assured the hon. gentleman, that no part of the personal property of the his late majesty had come under the cognizance of that part of the government connected with the Treasury.
 Mr. Baring  thought that if this subject appeared to be involved in any mystery or intrigue, a strong sensation would be excited in the country. If the exaggerated estimates had gone abroad as to the amount of the property left by his late majesty; that circumstance was itself calculated to excite the public attention, which would probably be increased after the conversation which had taken place upon the subject. If the right hon. gentleman did not wish to give any distinct information, he might at least state some reason which rendered it inconvenient to be more explicit.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  re-
 155
 Mr. Bernal  observed, that information was extracted from the right hon. gentleman, like a bad cork from a bottle of brandy.
 The Attorney-General  said, that an objection  in limine
 The Attorney General  was of opinion, that in the cases which had been pointed at, it might be very important to the parties to possess the right of moving for a new trial. He therefore could not consent to adopt the clause. He explained and justified the increased amount of law charges for the last year, and proceeded to show that the statement recently made by the late member for Colchester receiving briefs and counsel being paid for all prosecutions throughout the country whether they attended them or not was erroneous.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that he did not know upon what grounds the hon. member had come forward with so much zeal to attack the coronation, if it were not on the ground of the expense by which it would be attended; and upon that point he was happy to inform him that it would be much less than had been originally expected. With regard to the argument which the hon. member had built upon the unfortunate differences now existing between their majesties, he felt himself compelled to to say, that his majesty's rights were not to be impaired either by the absence or the presence of the queen on this occasion; for the coronation was not a grand gala, or national jubilee, as the hon. member had represented it, but a ceremony whereby the king ratified the compact which existed between himself and his people; and therefore was a ceremony which ought not to be delayed. His majesty's ministers deserved no blame on account of the period at which the coronation was to take place, as it had been fixed at the usual period after the death of the pre-
 158 l.
 Dr. Lushington  apprehended that at present there were circumstances of so pecular a nature, both with respect to the situation of the queen-consort, and the State of the public finances, that ministers themselves must believe they would best discharge their duty by advising that this ceremony should be delayed. There was, in fact, no necessity for a coronation at all, and he believed it would be found, on referring to the history of this country, that many kings had reigned for a considerable time without having gone through that ceremony. If then, there was no necessity for his majesty's being crowned, it became a question whether or not, at the present moment, it was expedient. His hon. friend had stated, that while the trial of her majesty was going on, it was improper that there should be a public solemnity in which she could take no part. In this opinion he entirely concurred; and he also agreed with his hon. friend in thinking that it would be imprudent to rouse and provoke the feelings of the people of this country, at a time when they would be in a high state of excitation. He would appeal to the noble lord himself whether it was not impolitic to offer this additional excitement to public feeling at a time when the noble lord must know, from the addresses that were presented to her majesty, what the opinion of the people was respecting the treatment which she had received; and when he must also know, if he at all looked forward to futurity, that these feelings would hereafter become stronger than they were at present. But there was still another objec-
 159 l. l. l. 160
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  expressed his surprise at the observations of the hon. and learned gentleman, as he had allowed the subject to sleep so long unnoticed. The hon and learned gentleman knew of it long ago from the king's proclamation. He had, however, chosen to wait until a considerable expence had been incurred, and when the question was, not so much whether the public money should be paid, but whether the tradesmen who had been employed should be honourably paid? He wished the hon. and learned gentleman to consider, whether or not when the complaint from many parts of the country was of a want of employment, the occurrence of such a great public solemnity as that in contemplation was peculiarly desirable, giving work as it must to many branches of the unoccupied? The hon. and learned gentleman must know that the sum voted from the public purse would form but a small part of the money that would be expended on the occasion. He must know that the expence to which the higher classes of so-

 Dr. Lushington  said, that what he had stated was, that the distress of the country was occasioned by the extravagance of ministers.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  continued. He would say no more on that point. With respect to the coronation of his majesty, he begged to observe that the period when that ceremony should take place, was fixed long before the arrival of the queen. The period having
 162
 Colonel Davies  was of opinion, that the period fixed for his majesty's coronation was a most inconvenient one. Irritated as the public mind now was, it might be productive not only of disorder and riot, but of bloodshed. Why, then, should his majesty's advisers propose such a proceeding at this moment? It was not indispensably necessary that his majesty should be crowned immediately. His late majesty was not crowned until 13 months after his accession. He thought, therefore, that as there was no other mode of repressing tumult on this occasion than by calling out an extraordinary number of the military, the danger likely to arise had better be avoided by postponing the coronation for the present.
 Mr. Bennet  said, the hon. gentleman had accused his side of the House for not having taken an earlier opportunity of opposing the coronation at the period proposed. But who was it that proposed that coronation—who was it that directed the erection of the works for it? It was his majesty's ministers, not the opposition, as neither he nor his friends had any opportunity of speaking on the subject until it came fairly before the House. He could not help feeling, that nothing was more likely to excite public indignation, than to find, that while one House was agitating a bill of pains and penalties against her majesty, the other was employed in voting a sum of money to be expended in the pageantry and show of the coronation of the king. Historians had remarked, that in the reign of Henry 8th, the public mind had been much agitated, while proceedings were pending against the queen
 163
 Mr. Robinson  said, he rose principally to make a few observations, which were drawn from him by the extraordinary and unmeaning rant of the hon. and learned doctor, who had worked himself into a most violent passion, and had belaboured his majesty's ministers most unmercifully; but if there was any foundation for that harangue, the hon. and learned doctor had been lamentably remiss in his duty in not calling them to account long ago. He ought to have objected to the first step taken in preparing for the coronation; he had not however done so, and therefore the learned doctor was wrong in now objecting to the expenses necessary to carry that object into effect. It was objected that so large a sum should be expended in the mere pageantry of a coronation, and that too while a bill of pains and penalties was pending against her majesty. He denied that the coronation was a pageantry. Let the hon. member look to the preamble to the act of king William, and he would find that the coronation was any thing but a parade. The king was bound to take certain oaths, and it would be a fault in ministers to delay his majesty's doing so. The hon. member then read the oath which his majesty was bound to take, "that he was bound to govern the country according to the statutes; that he should administer justice in mercy; that he would maintain the religion of the country as by law established, &c." Would the House, after this, say that the coronation was a matter of choice? He maintained it was matter of law, and could not be dispensed with [Hear, hear!]. This being the case, bow could ministers have justified themselves in advising the postponement of so important a measure? Next came the objection in point of time. He remembered, that six months since, a great objection was, that it was to take place in the dog-days: however this might be, he was sure that Christmas would be found a much more inconvenient period. The public curiosity would naturally be excited on the occasion, and ministers would undergo no small portion of blame, if a period was fixed when the ceremony of
 164
 Mr. Baring  concurred with his hon. friends as to the unfitness of the period chosen for the coronation; but with regard to the expense, he could not think that there would be any man in the country whose feelings would be shocked by it. The estimate was certainly far less than he had anticipated. Although it was undoubtedly of extreme importance that the king should be crowned soon after his accession, yet he could not see that a delay of 6, of 12, or of 18 months even, was material. He thought, also, that the ceremony should be performed with great solemnity; but he repeated that he could not see the necessity of being particular as to the precise period of the event. Pending the present proceedings with regard to her majesty, however, the celebration of that solemnity was likely to be not only unpleasant to the feelings of the people, but to have a very injurious effect upon the minds of many. If her majesty were declared innocent, every person would say, notwithstanding that it might be the right of the Crown to determine whether or no she should be

 Lord A. Hamilton  observed, that the noble lord had treated him with much unfairness, and the House with still more. In the first place, every gentleman would do him the justice to acknowledge his having stated in the outset, that if the noble lord meant, in the present session, to move for an allowance to her majesty, he would say nothing more on the subject. The noble lord, however, had told them that her majesty had been provided for until the 5th of July. He would now ask the noble lord how her majesty was to be provided for after that period? and in answer to the triumph of the noble lord, he would observe, that, had he postponed the statement which he had that night

 Lord Archibald Hamilton  was extremely surprised that the noble lord had wholly omitted to mention any provision for the queen. He had, more than once, when

 Mr. Ricardo  thought that if the various articles likely to be consumed at the coronation could be bought cheaper in the foreign than the home market, there could be no objection to their not being home manufacture, seeing that they must be purchased by the produce of our own industry. l.
 Mr. G. Bankes  thought that the clause proposed would be more properly made the subject of a specific measure.
 Mr. Canning  stated the nature of their establishment under the auspices of the East India company, as well as their probable duties in cases of necessity. He also referred to certain pending discussions on the subject, and to the length of time during which the corps had existed.
 Mr. Canning  gave notice of his intention on a future day to strike out the clause in the bill relating to the payment of the men. He suggested that any discussion would be more conveniently taken on the third reading.
 Mr. Tierney  said, it was perfectly true, that he did state that he would not agree to any permanent vote for her majesty, until the charges alleged against her were cleared up. When her majesty's name was omitted in the Liturgy, he had declared that if her conduct was such as to justify that measure, he would vote against any grant that should be proposed. He was a little surprised, however, at the course the noble lord was now pursuing, because, if he understood him correctly, he had stated that he would, whenever the provision for the royal family was brought before the House, take some notice of her majesty's situation. It appeared to him that her majesty was treated in the most extraordinary way, no provision of any kind having been made for her. The noble lord had stated very truly, that no member of that House could bring such a question forward of his own motion, but that it must be done by a message from the Crown. He knew that there must be a message on the subject; but he supposed no intention existed to make the necessary provision for her majesty [Lord Castlereagh here intimated across the table that such an intention did exist]. He was very happy to find that a proper sum of money would be allowed
 152 l. l. l.
 Mr. Tierney  repeated the question, and asked, in case of the non-existence of such a document, what had become of that property?
 Mr. Tierney  thought it very important to ascertain whether his majesty had died intestate, or if any paper amounting to a will had been found, what measures had been taken with respect to the disposition of the personal property of his late majesty.
 Mr. Tierney  said, that as to the vote to be proposed, he was not aware that he should have any thing to object on that account. He was no enemy, on some occasions, to pageants, and, least of all, to such a pageant as the one in question. But he regretted that it was determined that the coronation should take place upon the 1st of August. He sincerely lamented that his majesty should have been advised to come to such a resolution. After the steps, however, which had been taken, after the official letters that had been addressed to all parties concerned, it was hardly, perhaps, to be expected, that his majesty should stop short in the transaction. He did not, at the same time, think that there were ten gentlemen in the House who would not thank him, if he could devise any means by which the celebration of the coronation could be farther deferred. Now, after the arrival of her majesty in this country, he did own that he had hoped the propriety and necessity of such a postponement would have been felt and acted upon. He should be liable to a great deal of misunderstanding, if he were to state all that he apprehended as likely to result from the coronation so speedily taking place. The general opinion was that her majesty had been oppressed. He did not here mean to say a word as to the opinion of her innocence or guilt; yet it could not be contended for a moment but that this opinion of her being oppressed was the general feeling; and the one which pervaded not only the lower classes, but the higher ranks of so-

 Mr. J. P. Grant  said, that as part of the property, which was  primâ facie
 Mr. Hume  wished to ask the chancellor of the exchequer whether he would have any objection to state, upon a motion being made, what steps had been taken by ministers to ascertain whether his late majesty had left a will, and what part of his personal property was likely to accrue to the public.
 Mr. Hume  contended, that if his late majesty had died intestate, his property was no longer private but public; and if public, it was the duty of the House to ascertain, especially in the 'present distressed state of the country, in what manner it had been disposed of.
 Mr. Hume  said, that when he put a similar question to the chancellor of the exchequer upon a former occasion, the right hon. gentleman was certainly understood to have stated distinctly that a will did exist. If his late majesty had died intestate, it was proper that the House should know what had become of the money vested by acts of parliament under commissions, before they proceeded to grant sums of money to any part of the royal family. He trusted that some honourable member would take an early opportunity of making a motion upon the subject.
 Mr. Hume  expressed his regret that so strong a disposition prevailed upon all occasions by the civil power to call in the aid of the military. This step had been taken on Friday last within the city of London, when, as far as he could learn, not the slightest necessity existed. This was a most dangerous practice; he hoped that England would not be changed entirely, but that the civil power now, as formerly, would be paramount. On the occasion to which he referred, a legally established body had met for legal purposes, and yet something like an attempt was made to overawe it by the presence of a military force. It was the duty of magistrates upon all occasions, as far as possible, to avoid calling in the aid of the soldiers, and then the civil power would be both obeyed and respected.
 Mr. Hume  added, that troops were stationed in Holborn, half of which was within and half without the limits of the city.
 Mr. Creevey  rose to make a few observations upon a subject which the right hon. gentleman was going to introduce to their notice—he meant the expense of the ensuing Coronation. As yet there had not been placed upon their table any estimate of the sums of money which would be required for such a ceremony; and till such an estimate was presented to them, he for one, would not grant a single farthing for it. Indeed, it was his opinion, that, under the present circumstances of the country, no coronation ought to take place: for let honorable members consider—and if they did not consider, the public would consider for them—the situation to which that House was at present reduced. A green bag had been submitted as well to its notice as to the notice of the other House of Parliament. The other House had proceeded so far in the investigation of the contents of that bag as to render it extremely probable that a bill would be immediately introduced to expose her majesty the queen to the utmost disgrace and infamy. The House of Commons had, however, refused to enter with similar speed into a similar investigation; and yet, notwithstanding that circumstance, ministers, who knew well that that bag was lying on their table unopened, and that proceedings might arise from the opening of it which could only be terminated in another place—ministers had dared to come down, and to ask for a large grant of money to be expended in a grand gala, a great national jubilee, whilst the queen of the country was labouring under the most heavy and grievous accusations. If the laws of the land had prescribed any particular period, after the demise of one monarch and the accession of another, within which this ceremony of coronation was necessarily to take place, then, however painful the circumstances attending it might be, he should have said, let it take place within that period. But no such limitation existed, and therefore, under existing circumstances, it was most improper that it should be held at the time which was now fixed for it. Indeed, his majesty would be most imprudently advised if he did not postpone it until the conclusion of this investigation If there

 Mr. Denman  wished to observe, that this question was brought before the committee, without her majesty's knowledge. She had given no directions whatsoever on the subject; she had no possible doubt that all necessary means for defending her rights and asserting her character would be afforded her from some quarter or other. It was, however, fit that the House should understand that the expenses would necessarily be very considerable. There was, however, another object much nearer to
 153
 Mr. T. Wilson  said, it was not his intention to prejudge the guilt or innocence of her majesty, but he thought it would be derogatory from the dignity of the crown to refuse the sum proposed to defray the expenses of his majesty's coronation. It was rather odd that those gentlemen who had now objected to this ceremony, had not, on any former occasion, signified their disapprobation of its taking place at the time proposed. Any objection on that head ought to have been made at an earlier period.
 Mr. James  answered, that early in the next session he designed to bring the subject forward, and that his motion would then be, that the three magistrates who had called in the military under pretence of quelling a riot, when not the slightest disturbance existed, should be called to the bar of the House.
 Mr. W. Smith  would ask the right hon. gentleman, if he really believed that the king, after he had taken the coronation oath would be more or less bound to reign according to law than he was after he had taken the oath before the privy council? Could it be said that he was at any future period to be absolved from any of his regal functions because he had not taken a coronation oath? As to those splendid ceremonies, of which the chancellor of the exchequer had spoken as calculated to support the dignity of the Crown, he conceived that they were—"more honoured in the breach than in the observance." He appealed to every hon. gentleman, whether it was not his opinion that the feelings of the country were more in favour of economy than of the most splendid public exhibition. He had hitherto purposely abstained from saying any thing on the question of the queen; and if he were now to speak his sentiments, he apprehended they would not please either side of the House. He thought that the propriety or impropriety of having a coronation while proceedings were going on against her majesty, was merely a matter of feeling; but it was a matter that came home to the mind and bosom of every person.
 Mr. Chetwynd  observed, that in offences against the revenue not a single instance of a new trial had occurred in the last year.
 Mr. Chetwynd  said, it was his intention to propose three additional clauses to this bill. The first of them was, to enable judges to pass sentence upon defendants at Nisi Prius, instead of bringing them up to the court of King's Bench.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  hoped, that should the coronation take place, a due regard would be paid to the encouragement of British manufacture. The article of velvet particularly ought to be encouraged on this occasion. It was true that English velvet could not compete with that of Genoa, yet it was equally handsome in appearance. This might appear a trifling consideration, but he hoped it would not be forgotten by his majesty's advisers.
 Sir J. Newport  wished to ask the chancellor of the exchequer, whether his late majesty had left a will, or, if he had died intestate, in what manner his personal property had been disposed of?
 Mr. Lushington  was anxious to occupy as short a portion as possible of the time of the Committee' in stating the grounds of his objection to most of the resolutions of the hon. gentleman. His first resolution was unnecessary, since one to a similar effect had been voted in the last year. The second resolution was unfit to appear on the Journals of the House, in consequence of a material error which affected the calculations of the hon. gentleman. The hon. gentleman had compared the revenue of the last year with that of 1796. Now, in the revenue for 1796, the whole expense of collecting the post-horse duties was omitted; and it was obvious that this omission must have a material effect upon the whole calculations. No results could be accurate which were founded upon a comparison of the revenue in a year of peace with that in a year of war. Besides, upon a more accurate examination of his figures, the hon. gentleman would find that he had a material error in his calculation of the percentage. He had, in fact, taken one line of figures for another, and as this error vitiated the whole calculations, a proposition founded upon them was unfit to appear upon the Journals. To his third resolution he was ready to accede, but he thought it right that it should be accompanied by another resolution which he should submit to the House. With respect to the other resolutions of the hon. gentleman, if he suc
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that there was no unwillingness in the House to attend to a subject which was so materially connected with the public interest. The hon. mover had laid before them a number of comparative statements, which the secretary of the Treasury had answered. The collection of the revenue in different countries had been adverted to; but that was not a fair criterion for the direction of the House. It was observed, that the collection of the revenue in France was more economical, than in Ireland; but as the revenue of France was principally a land revenue, it was evidently more easy to collect it than to gather in the revenue of Ireland, which comprised many different heads. An hon. gentleman seemed to reprehend the office of distributor of stamps and receiver-general of land-tax as being sources of permanent influence, and kept up for that purpose. This he entirely denied. The system had been acted on for many years, and had been found to operate beneficially. The receivers of land-tax, and the distributors of stamps, did not realise so much emolument as was imagined. They had often had reason to repent the frauds which had been practised on them without any blame being attachable to them. The balances in the hands of receivers-general and distributors of stamps were very doubtful. Though the nominal amount might be great, yet the real amount, in consequence of the number of persons employed under them, was often reduced to a very small sum. 190
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  expressed his conviction, that the House would agree with him in thinking that no inquiry should be entered into with respect to the private affairs of the royal family, unless under circumstances of imperious necessity: and as no such reason could be adduced in this case, he trusted the House would see that the hon. member's motion was unnecessary, especially after the explanation which he had to otter. Since the death of the king, a testamentary document had been found among his majesty's papers, and the subject had been referred to the consideration of competent persons, who had not yet made their report. But whatever the decision of those persons might be, there was no question whatever that the property of the late king devolved upon his present majesty. But as to the amount of that property, the hon. mover had been very much misled, for that property comprehended about 90,000 l. l.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that be could not feel himself at liberty to answer any questions affecting the private affairs of the Crown, without special authority. It appeared, however, that the hon. mover, as

 Mr. Tierney  returned his sincere thanks to the hon. mover for having brought his proposition before the House. He had seldom heard a more clear and dispassion-ate statement, or one evincing greater re-search. He felt, however, the same des-pair on the subject as his hon. friend who had just sat down. The manner in which the hon. gentleman's proposition had been received, was very discouraging in this respect; and he was also discouraged by his own experience when he was a young man, and began to work on the subject of re-venue. When such resolutions were i moved as those proposed this evening, it; had been usual to have them printed, and for the Treasury to move counter-resolutions, which being also printed, a day was fixed for the discussion of both. That, however, was not the course pursued. The first of the hon. mover's resolutions was to be negatived, and in lieu of it the hon. secretary of the Treasury moved at once a resolution, that so much had been done in the way of retrenchment, that it was only necessary to persevere. He strongly reprobated the recent practice of referring the consideration of the finances to a committee of persons appointed by the Treasury. He agreed with his hon. friend near him that at bottom all the abuses on this subject were attributable to influence; and that nothing could make an administration more popular, than fairly and firmly to set about correcting it. But he was
 188 l. l. l. 189
 Mr. John Smith  thought the first resolution the best. In the present state of the finances of the country, he was persuaded that-no man could quit the House without a wound to his conscience who did not vote for it. He had been very sorry therefore to hear the hon. secretary object to it. In Ireland among other misgovernments, the collection of the revenue was made a job; the consequence of which was, that the charge amounted to 16 per cent on the nett revenue, and 22 per cent on the gross revenue. He was one of those who thought that the whole subject of the revenue and the expenditure of the country ought to come once more under the cognizance of parliament. He had a great respect for the members of the former committees of that House on the subject, but he must say, that in some respects they had strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel. The collection of the Customs was especially expensive. He had a friend high in the Custom house, who was well acquainted with all the details, and who had told him that he would be very glad to farm the collection at one-fifth of the present charge. Much was lost to the country by the large balances which were unnecessarily left in the hands of the receivers of the land tax. The great evil was, that the government was a government depending on influence; and that ministers were afraid to retrench lest they should lose their influence. He was persuaded, however, that if they would apply economy as a principle pervading every branch of the state, they would soon obtain more real power and popularity than by the distribution of any places which they now had it in their power to give.
 Mr. Hume  said, in rising to make the motion of which he had given notice, he was actuated by no hostile feeling to his majesty's ministers, who, by granting the accounts for which he had moved, had shown a disposition to admit discussion and to court inquiry. Though his own calculation differed from the official accounts in some respects, he preferred adopting the latter in all cases, to avoid any controversy on that head. The first resolution which he had to submit was merely to pledge the House to a vigilant superintendence of the public expenditure, and to a minute investigation of the mode of collecting the revenue. This, in substance, though not in form, was similar to the resolution proposed by the chancellor of the Exchequer, when he had called on the House to impose three millions of new taxes. He hoped the House would now repeat this pledge, as it was by small savings on the multiplied items of expenditure alone that economy could be effected. He could have only wished that this subject had been brought forward by an hon. baronet, who had proposed similar resolutions in the last session, and from whom they would have come with greater weight. The second resolution was a comparison of the expenses of collection of the revenue at three different times. The account of the expense at the first period was taken from the Reports of the Finance Committee, of which the late Speaker was chairman (1796–7); of the second, from the Report of the Committee, of which the member for Corfe-castle was chairman; and of the third, from the annual accounts presented to the House. The third resolution was a comparison of the nett amount of the revenue at three different periods, taken from the same sources. As the gross receipt of this revenue had been, in 1796, twenty-three millions; in 1810, forty-five millions; and in 1820, fifty five millions, it was to be expected, he thought, that the amount having much increased while the officers and boards of the revenue remained the same, the percentage should have been diminished more than it appeared it had been. The rate per cent-age on the gross receipt in the year 1796 was 5 l. .s d. l. s. d. l. s. d. 177 l. l. l. l. 178 l. l. l. l. l. s. l. s. d. l. s. d l. s. d. l. s. d. l. l. 179 l. l. l. 180 l. l. l. l 181 l. l. l.
 Mr. Hume  said, that after the explanation which the House had heard, he had no objection to withdraw his motion, declaring that he should not have brought it forward if it were not for the refusal of the noble lord to make any answer to the question which was put to him last night. It would be admitted, however, that the motion would produce a satisfactory result, by doing away with the exaggerated reports which had gone abroad respecting the amount of the private property of the late king.
 Mr. Hume  said, that the motion which he was about to introduce to the House was one most worthy of their serious consideration, as it related to the private property left by his late majesty. He then proceeded to explain how the law

 Mr. Fergusson  could not agree that there should be no deviation from the old proportion of the duties in the two countries, though he wished the duty to be somewhat lower in Scotland than in England.
 Mr. Kennedy  said, that if the agriculture of Scotland had improved, it was owing to a very spirited expenditure of capital in that country, and not to any cause connected with the taxes. Formerly, much encouragement was given to the establishment of small legal distilleries. The act for that purpose passed parliament four or five years ago, and produced the most beneficial effects. But since the act of July last, that encouragement was entirely taken away, and the consequence was that the revenue was very much diminished by the number of smugglers. He put it to the right hon. gentleman, whether it would not be for the benefit of the country, even with a view to revenue, to allow the occupiers of land to distil the corn grown within their own lands.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he should inform the noble lord what he intended to do, that the noble lord might know how far his motion was rendered unnecessary. He should propose a temporary allowance of 6 d.
 Lord Castlereagh  had no objection to the bill being brought in and printed, but he wished it to be fully understood, that it was not a bill interfering with the general commutation of tithes, but a counterpart of a bill which passed the House in 1817, but which was thrown out in another House.

 Lord Castlereagh  stated, that when he yesterday submitted to the House a resolution founded upon the king's message, relative to a provision being made by parliament for the other branches of the royal family, he had stated the general nature of the resolutions which he should this evening have the honour to propose to their notice. This would render it unnecessary for him to do any thing more than repeat the general principles upon which it was founded. The House were already aware that upon the demise of the queen a reduction of nearly 180,000 l. l. l. l. l. 224 l. l. l. l. 225 l. l.
 Mr. Bankes  observed, that if the House consented to grant these sums in their present shape, they would establish a precedent which would lead them an indefinite length in the way of example on every demise of the Crown. Though unwilling to object to the whole of the resolutions, he could not bring himself to vote for them as they stood at present, for many reasons:—first of all, because he found that a proper scale of compensation had not been adopted in the provision proposed, a person of 35 years of age being often placed in the same situation as a person of 65 years, who had spent half his life in his majesty's service: secondly, because many of the individuals to whom he alluded were not retiring on half pay, but were receiving their full salaries and allowances when they were performing no services, and were thus adding an additional and unexpected burden to those which already pressed upon the country: thirdly, because they were able to discharge other offices, and thus might be provided for in another manner. Indeed, he could not help observing that until the present time no one had ever beard of these charges on the privy purse.
 226
 Mr. C. Grant  said, in the present stage of the proceeding he should certainly not oppose it. He should, however, reserve to himself the privilege of examining its provisions carefully in a more advanced stage.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that, with a limited pension-list, however much it was to be regretted, it was still evident that circumstances would arise which rendered an application to the liberality of parliament absolutely necessary. He thought the circumstances of the present case fully justified him in appealing to it, notwithstanding the objection by which he had been met, that if this precedent were established, others would be defended upon it He could not see into futurity; but as the present circumstances were so very extraordinary, he thought it would be still more extraordinary if similar circumstances should again occur. In proposing the present pensions, they had by no means continued the late salaries, because the persons who held them had along with them board wages, and many other emoluments. The pages of the back stairs were particularly entitled to the pensions which it was proposed to grant, as they had been employed about the person of his late majesty till his demise, and, to their honour be it spoken, no anecdotes derogatory to his dignity or
 229
 Mr. Williams  enforced Mr. Hume's view of the proposed grants, thinking that according to the precedent referred to by the noble lord, they ought to be reduced at least one-fifth.
 Sir J. Newport  asked, whether it was the intention of the noble lord to keep the order which was fixed for Friday in abeyance, until the lords should pronounce their decision upon the subject? If such were the noble lord's intention, it would be a very uncommon course of proceeding.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that the proceeding instituted by the lords might never be brought in any legislative way before that House, and, therefore, he proposed only that the order for considering his majesty's message should be delayed, but that the House should by no means abandon its right of inquiry upon the subject.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  hoped the House would not agree to the course proposed by the noble lord. If no other member would take the sense of the House upon the subject, he should feel it his duty to do so.
 Lord A. Hamilton  said, that this concession was so inferior to what the people of Scotland considered as due to them, that he should persist in his motion. The grounds on which he objected to the tax lately imposed on Scots malt were three. I, That it had been the practice for more than a century to impose on Scots malt only half the duty that was imposed on malt in England; 2, that a less tax had been generally imposed on beer or big than on barley malt; and 3, that the tax was passed at an improper time and in an unfair manner—in the last week of the last session, when scarcely any Scots members were present, or knew of the bill. The effect of the increased duty had been such in Scotland, that the distilleries could no longer work except at a loss. The fact was, very few of the great distilleries had worked during the last twelve months, and those only were satisfied with the duty as it at present stood who found means of defrauding the revenue. It seemed probable, indeed, that this in-crease of duty on Scots malt had originated in some mistake, for a letter
 219 s. d. s.
 Lord A. Hamilton  said, that the only point on which he meant to divide the House was this, that the existing duties were too heavy.
 Lord A. Hamilton  having risen to make his motion respecting the Tax on Malt in Scotland,
 Mr. Boswell  said, that from the variableness of the climate in Scotland, it frequently happened that a great part of the corn was damaged before it could be got in, and was rendered unfit for consumption in any way except in the way of distillation. But when the duty on all kinds of grain was the same, it acted to

 Mr. Harbord  thought that the grievance complained of could not be expressed in too strong language, and objected parti-

 Mr. Lockhart  explained the object of the bill which he had supported in 1817,
 223
 Mr. Hume  said, the noble lord had Stated that there was no precedent for continuing the salaries and pensions to the servants of the king after the death of their illustrious master; and yet he had called upon the House to imitate the precedent of 1819, which he had defended by three others, and from which it appeared that it was usual to continue such salaries to the servants of a deceased queen. He also called upon the House to imitate it: for they would recollect that a committee had then sat and had recommended the scale of pensions which the House had afterwards adopted. If the noble lord would look to one of the documents then presented to the House, he would see that the committee had stated, that there were two classes of servants to be rewarded. In the first class no individual was admitted who had not been in the service of her majesty for 8 years at least. The salaries of the servants in this class amounted to 5,721 l. l. 227 l. l. l. l.
 Mr. M. A. Taylor  brought up the report of the committee appointed to inquire into the possibility of Steam Engines consuming their own smoke. He said that the object of the inquiry had been completely answered, and he trusted that, ere long, the metropolis would be freed from the nuisance to which it had been long subject. He intended in the next session to introduce a bill, to declare the law upon the subject, and to prevent those nuisances from being longer continued.
 Mr. Colborne  did not deny the existence of the grievance complained of, but thought it might be easily remedied. The Norwich sessions might be empowered to try those prisoners who had been confined for any length of time; or the prisoners might be removed to the town of Thetford, there to undergo their trial. He saw no reason why a short bill should not be introduced to this effect.
 Mr. Newman  observed, that the bill of 1817 seemed not to be looked on by the church, generally speaking, with alarm, as might be proved from its not having been opposed by the bishops. It was solely rejected on the ground of its being brought forward so late in the session.
 Mr. Huskisson  stated, that according to the recommendation of a committee upon the subject, there was a compensation granted to the queen's servants in lieu of perquisites, in addition to the vote alluded to by the hon member for Aberdeen, and therefore that hon. member's comparison was erroneous. With regard to Mr. West, he was enabled to say not only that the allowance from the lord chamberlain's department was continued to that illustrious artist to the end of his life, but to add, that Mr. West received 1,000 l. l.
 Mr. W. Smith  was extremely happy to hear that it was not the intention of ministers to grant any pensions to the great officers of state, as he had long thought that the great chamberlains, &c. about the court might be well content with the dignity which they enjoyed, without debasing it by receiving a-salary. Among the names of those who had received pensions out of the privy purse, he found those of Sir W. Herschel and Miss Herschel, for400 l. 228 l.
 Sir H. Parnell  rose, to call the attention of the House to a subject which materially concerned the agriculturists of Ireland; namely, the present system of collecting the tithes. As an instance of the practical inconvenience and injustice of the present system, he held in his hand a receipt for 3 l. s. 222 s. d. l. s. s. d.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  objected to the two remedies proposed by the hon. member: to the first, because he thought it would be an act of injustice; and to the second, because an unnecessary expense would be incurred.
 Sir James Mackintosh  presented a petition from Robert Hawkes and Edward Taylor, sheriffs of Norwich, complaining that the assizes for the city were only held once a-year. The grievance of which the petitioners complained was a very serious one. The House was aware that, under the present regulations, the assizes for Norwich were only held once a-year, and that the spring assizes for the county did not extend to the city. The city of Norwich had, therefore, the same grievance to complain of as the four northern counties, which had already been under the consideration of the House. The spring assizes for the county of Norfolk were held at Thetford, and the summer assizes in the city of Norwich. One individual, committed on the 11th Sept. 1819, was confined ten months in prison previous to trial; two were committed on the 30th Sept. 1819; one on the 6th Oct. 1819; two on the 15th Jan., and one on the 3rd Feb. 1820. The petitioners expressed their hope that the House would take the subject into their serious consideration, in order that they might enjoy the same right possessed by nearly the whole of the counties of England. The hon. member trusted that the wisdom of parliament would devise some means of redressing this great grievance.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  said, he held in his hand a petition of rather a singular nature. It was one from Mr. Hugh Campbell, a student at law, complaining of the conduct of the Highland Society of London. The petitioner, it appeared, had been inspired by a laudable zeal for the literature
 218
 Sir J. Marjoribanks  complained that the act imposing an additional duty on malt made in Scotland, was passed at a late period of the last session quite unexpectedly, when a great part of the Scotch members had left town. He professed his determination to vote for the resolution.
 Sir J. Newport  agreed that this would be a conciliatory measure, and tend to allay much of the discontent which existed in consequence of the system adopted in the collection oftythes. It would do away with much of the jealousy which existed towards the clergy of the established church, and would set at rest that which was growing up of late in Ireland; namely, the setting up claims to make articles titheable which had not been hitherto so. This measure had the approbation of the clergy.
 Sir Ronald Fergusson  rose to bring forward his motion respecting the Milan Commission. It was with unfeigned regret that he felt himself bound in public duty, conscious as he was of his own inadequacy for the task, to bring this question under consideration. Undoubtedly, the subject was of a most delicate and painful nature, and, in its result, of the utmost importance to the peace and safety of the country. If his majesty's ministers had pursued a proper course either by not erasing her majesty's name from the Liturgy, or by retracing their steps when they saw the mischievous consequences of their conduct, the ferment which now agitated the public mind would have been avoided. The noble
 260 261 espionnage, l. l. 262
 Lord Castlereagh  felt it to be his duty, under the circumstances in which the House was at present placed, to oppose the motion. It would, he conceived, be a waste of their time, if he were led, in consequence of what had fallen from the gallant general, to enter into an explanation of the course of conduct that his majesty's ministers had been induced to take in consequence of the important subject which had recently occupied their consideration. Had the gallant general, he would ask, seen any thing in the general conduct of ministers that rendered it necessary to bring this question under discussion? Or had he perceived any part of their proceedings that appeared to justify the casting the least imputation on them, as the authors of this painful investigation? He conceived that the gallant general had not; and therefore he would simply apply himself to the motion now before the House. The objection he took to it did not arise from any indisposition on the part of ministers to give the fullest information on the subject when the proper time arrived; for, whatever might be the gallant general's opinion of ministers— whatever cause might have induced him
 263 264 265 266 267 268 269
 Lord Castlereagh  explained. If the measure now instituted failed in the lords, there was no idea of founding criminal proceedings in that House. He had only

 Mr. Bennet  began by expressing his surprise that none of his majesty's ministers had attempted to answer his hon. friend, (Mr. Creevey); for though some unguarded expressions might have fallen from him, yet many of his observations had been much to the purpose, and would have a stinging effect out of doors. Ministers were bound to stand up and to justify their master. The noble lord had said, in express terms, that the king of England had lent himself to an accommodation respecting indecency and adultery. No sovereign had ever been so publicly degraded. He did not believe that ministers themselves had ever believed the charges in the green bag, because, if they had believed them, they could not have given such advice as had been given. The queen of England, charged with adultery, was not only to be addressed by both Houses of Parliament, but she was to be acknowledged in certain courts near which she might choose to reside. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Canning), after seeing all the charges in the green bag, had in a most manly speech, a speech which did him the greatest credit, professed his respect and his affection for her majesty. The right hon. gentleman, after having seen the charge, had used the remarkable expressions, that his attention, affection, and respect, remained the same as they had been. He could therefore produce the right hon. gentleman as an authority opposed to his colleagues, for he at least dissented. If, in the opinion of the other ministers, she was black with guilt, in the right hon. gentleman's opinion she was white as snow. What was the feeling of the country upon this subject at the present moment? From every part one sentiment (whether just or not, he knew not) of respect for her majesty, and of conviction that she was innocent, was heard. This was the natural result of the mode of proceeding adopted against her majesty. The noble lord had come down to that House and proposed the most hateful of measures—a green bag, to be investigated by a secret committee; and had, in some degree, explained how it was to be composed. The queen's legal advisers were to be excluded; of course the attorney and solicitor-general must also have been excluded. The committee, then, must
 276 277 278
 Lord Castlereagh  rose to order. He really must submit to the House whether it was decent or parliamentary to impute to the king acts which could only be considered as done by his servants.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose, pursuant to notice, to postpone the order of the day for taking his majesty's Message into consideration. Before he proceeded to that question, he wished to make a few observations on what had fallen from the hon. gentleman who had recently addressed the House. He knew not how far the order of the House would suffer an individual to go when he was determined to transgress the bounds of decency. But certainly, in this case, the hon. member had uttered sentiments which would not be suffered where the feelings of private individuals were concerned, and which never should have been used in speaking of the character of the sovereign [Hear, hear!]. He protested solemnly, in the face of the House and of the country, against the speech which the hon. member had made that night. No individual was warranted in making such assertions—no individual at all acquainted with the fact would have applied such epithets to the feelings and the mind of the sovereign. Though placed under the most trying circumstances in which a monarch ever was or ever could be placed, his majesty had never betrayed the slightest symptom of a vindictive spirit [Hear!]. In every part of this unfortunate transaction he had evinced a feeling completely the reverse. Whatever his sense of injury might be, or whatever personal feeling might have been elicited by these transactions, his majesty had shown the most perfect forbearance with respect to every measure that ministers had adopted for the peace and safety of the country [Hear, hear!]. If they had gone on with this inquiry, it was from a sense of the justice of the cause, and in consequence of the manner in which the queen had conducted herself. A vindictive or passionate feeling had never been manifested by his majesty; and, instead of censuring his conduct, the honourable member and the country ought to offer him their heartfelt thanks for the efforts he had allowed ministers to make for the
 273
 Mr. Bennet  said, he had certainly wished to allude to the king  bonâ fide, 279
 Mr. Williams Wynn  said, that on the immediate subject of debate now before the House he was inclined to agree with Mr. Tierney, and though it was of little importance which way it was disposed of, he thought that on the whole it would be better to drop the motion for resuming the debate than to adjourn it to a future day. That debate was on the proposition for referring the papers contained in the green bag to a secret committee; but whatever course it might be expedient hereafter to adopt, it was clear that the appointment of a secret committee would be absurd, after all the matter to be examined, had been made public by the proceedings in the other House. With respect to the proceedings themselves on this momentous and perilous question, he had already
 282 283 violer" 284 285
 Mr. Keck  said, that he had been more pleased with the observations of Mr. Tierney, than with any speech which he had heard upon the very distressing subject before the House. Whenever the main question might be brought forward, he should feel it his duty to dismiss even the remembrance of general imputation from his mind. He should look for proof, and for proof only; and nothing short of the most damning proof should induce him to give credit to the stories which were in circulation.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that as the House was not in a situation to see its way as to the whole extent of the proceedings, he had thought it more convenient to postpone the order to the 15th August, than to discharge it altogether, or to move an address to the Crown. He should be extremely sorry, however, that there should be any difference of opinion in the House upon a mere matter of form.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that from the time of the Union, Irish spirits had been imported into this country without an)' obstruction in the state in which they were manufactured, but that in the acts under consideration, a clause was introduced, imposing a prohibition of the import of any raw spirits into this country, unless received into the stock of a rectifier. By this clause it was complained, that the Irish distillers were subjected to a very great grievance, and upon that representation being made to his majesty's government, the case had been fully considered. The result of that consideration was a conviction, that in common justice, the clause ought to be repealed. He moved that the chairman be directed to move for leave to bring in the bill for the repeal of the said clause.
 Mr. M. Fitzgerald  was surprised how-such a clause as that to which the motion referred happened to be smuggled into the act before the committee. This clause was evidently devised to interfere with the free and fair trade of Ireland, and to prevent the Irish distillers from coming into competition with those of Ireland. That it was cunningly contrived with that view, there could be no doubt. While he bore testimony to the candour of the chancellor of the Exchequer towards Ireland on this occasion, he begged to differ from him as to his construction of the act of Union. Spirits formed a distinct manufacture in Ireland, and were as free from the regulation of the English excise as its linen manufacture. The spirits distilled in Ireland were recognised by several laws of the legislature of that country, previous to the Union, as a distinct manufacture, and the principle of these laws ought to be respected by the imperial parliament. It was not any reason for placing Irish spirits under the control of the English excise, that they were of greater strength than the spirits distilled in this country. But as the terms of the clause referred to in the motion mentioned raw spirits he was prepared to argue, that it did not correctly speaking, extend to Irish spirits. For the Irish spirits, as he was enabled to show, was not a raw, but a complete spirit. It was indeed, much more a complete spirit than rum, and yet the produce of the colonies was treated with more liberality than the spirits of Ireland, for it was not required that the for-

 Mr. Marryat  said, it was impossible, if

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that the board of excise had suggested to him that this measure might affect the security of the revenue; but he was bound not to let any consideration of revenue interfere with the due execution of the act of Union, and if any of the clauses of that act were of doubtful meaning, the House was equally bound, in justice and liberality, to explain them in the sense most favourable to Ireland.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that previous to the Union this subject had come under Mr. Pitt's consideration, and he had received several representations, stating that the effect of it would be, that a large portion of the trade and capital of the distilleries would he transferred from England to Ireland. He replied, as a statesman of enlightened views ought, that it was a matter of indifference to him to what part of the empire the capital was transferred. On that principle, the union was framed, and he thought they had no right to consult the question of revenue at the expense of the first principles of the Union.
 Mr. John Foster , as he had been called upon in so pointed a manner, would only observe, that he had not said what the hon. member had imputed to him, and he would tell him why it was impossible he should have said so. At that time the English parliament was the parliament of Ireland, and he never could have been guilty of the absurdity of asserting, that they could not legislate for the whole of the empire. He put it to the hon. gentleman whether he could consider it as the part of a good member of parliament to be setting the manufacturers of one part of the country against those of another part, as if they had separate interests. He hoped never to see a national question so treated again.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer , in moving the order of the clay for the third reading of the Lottery bill, said, that in consequence of the communications which had taken place between an hon. friend of his and the hon. member for Aberdeen, he had consented to withdraw what were considered the objectionable clauses in the bill.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  observed, that such an enactment would be wholly unnecessary. The secretary was

 Mr. Bright  said, that if the facility for the import of Irish spirits were afforded, which the proposition was calculated to produce, it would be impossible to prevent that part of the English coast with which he was immediately connected, as well as the coast of North Wales, from being deluged with that article. He maintained, that the clause referred to did not involve any violation of the act of Union, as a fair review of the system of the countervailing duties would fully manifest. The fact was, that the Irish spirit generally imported into this country required rectification before it was fit for use, and therefore it was no grievance to let the clause stand as it did. At least it was no grievance to the people of England, who might be disposed to consume such spirits. But he begged the House to consider the consequences likely to follow from making such ardent spirits cheap in this country.
 Mr. Hume  expressed his satisfaction at the decision of the right hon. gentleman and pointed out some passages in the 33d and 38th clauses of the bill, which also required amendment. He also protested against the use of black letter in bills, which sometimes rendered it extremely difficult to ascertain their precise contents. In consequence of its having been alleged that the secretary of the lottery had some share in the contract, and might therefore favour one lottery office keeper or another, he wished to bring up two clauses, prohibiting the secretary, or any of the commissioners, from having any interest, direct or indirect, with the contract for the lottery.
 Mr. Creevey , not withstanding he might incur the displeasure of the noble lord, and notwithstanding the protest and the warning the noble lord had given to the House, would maintain that the proposition of his gallant friend was a perfectly just one, and the time precisely that in which the motion ought to have been made. His gallant friend had not precipitated his motion; he had delayed it till a certain proceeding had taken place in the other House of Parliament. So anomalous a course was, perhaps, never pursued upon any former occasion. The queen of this country was criminally proceeded against; and how? By the introduction of a bill in which she was called by the most infamous and scandalous names. Neither her majesty nor that House had any information on the subject; and, under these circumstances, his gallant friend said, what he conceived to be most proper. "Let me see the foundation of this measure; if you make a charge of this nature, let me see your infernal Milan commission, or whatever commission it may be, on whose statement it is founded." It was quite a novelty, a thing hitherto unknown to the constitution of this country, for the king to authorize a commission to hunt a subject with lawyers, attornies, and spies, assisted by the emperor of Austria, through every part of Europe. This indeed was quite a novel system. It was dangerous when any responsible servant of the Crown was placed at the head of such a proceeding; it was much more dangerous when a person like Mr. Leach—he begged his pardon, he should have said sir John Leach—who was not a responsible servant of the Crown, organized a system of es-pionnage against any individual of this country; but it was still worse when a person, placed in the situation of that gentleman, inflamed the feelings of particular persons by stating to them things of a doubtful nature, but which were calculated strongly to excite their passions. They had a right, he contended, to have this vice-chancellor before them. He would maintain that he was a disturber of the public peace of this country. [Hear, hear! and order.] He would show how he was a disturber of the public peace.
 270 271 272
 Mr. W. Dundas  expressed his concurrence in the motion; but he could not help requesting his right hon. friend to remember that he was chancellor of the Exchequer for Scotland as well as for Ireland, and to reflect that if the Irish distilleries were allowed the free import of their spirits into England, it was but common justice that the same privilege should be granted to the poor distiller of Scotland.
 Mr. W. Smith  acknowledged, that Ireland was a country to which England owed a debt of fearful magnitude for many ages of misgovernment, but this he thought was a bad mode of payment. He could not agree, that because some of the manufactures of Ireland had been destroyed, we were therefore to destroy some of the manufactures of England also. His hon. friend, whom he was glad to see in his place (Mr. J. Foster) had often contended, that the House had no right to interfere with the internal regulations of Ireland; he should like to know if that principle were now to be maintained. He strongly objected to the late period of the session at which this matter was brought on; and he also thought that as the excise had found sufficient reason for the mention of the obnoxious clause, the House ought to be acquainted with those reasons, now that it was about to be rescinded. It was not correct to speak of the rectifiers as the rivals of the Irish distillery; it would have been more consistent so to denominate the malt distillers, and on their behalf he must protest against this measure, except as an experiment. They had no objection to the importation of Irish spirits, if they were put on the same
 290
 The Speaker  said, he felt this to be a very difficult question. It was evident it was impossible on this occasion to exclude what was excluded on every other occasion. But where the introduction was neccessary, still greater caution ought to be used. It was highly improper to impute direct influence to the king in either House of Parliament, but he was aware that the same thing could be conveyed by putting it hypothetically. He did not suppose that any thing of that kind was intended; but in the warmth of debate, when any thing of that nature might be inadvertently introduced, the hon. member would see in what situation he (the Speaker) and the House were, if he did not use greater caution and restraint than on any other occasion, and carefully avoid whatever might excite strong feelings on this head.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  said, it was not his intention to bring into discussion the delicate points connected with this question. He did not view this as a personal question, but a question to be decided as between the public and her majesty. He thought the House had acted in a judicious manner in agreeing to the resolutions which had been passed, and he regretted that those resolutions had not been attended with effect. But if he had possessed the information which ministers appeared now to have possessed, and to the extent of the charges
 274
 Sir M. W. Ridley  declared it to be his opinion, that a greater fraud had never been practised on the public, than that which had taken place in the last lottery. The amount of the prizes was stated to be 130,000 l. l.
 Sir J. Newport  deprecated the language of an hon. member, in so loosely casting an imputation upon the conduct of the Irish and Scotch distillers. The hon. member had not a particle of evidence to sustain the charge, that the spirit of Ireland was not as fairly manufactured as that of England. But the fact was, that the Irish spirit was of a much superior manufacture, or it would not have had so much sale in competition with the spirit manufactured in England. The Irish distillery was under the special protection of the Union. But such was the superior quality of Irish spirit, that a great quantity of it was imported into this country before the Union, as might be seen upon reference especially to the imports of 1797. The import of this article had, however, considerably increased since the Union, and nothing could prevent that increase, if
 289
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that the motion of which the hon. member had just given notice, was unnecessary, because his majesty had already signified his intention, that the ceremony of the coronation shall not take place on the day originally named, nor was any other day fixed for that purpose. He wished to be distinctly understood, that the postponement of the coronation was not in consequence of any proceedings respecting her majesty.
 Sir Robert Heron  said, the House would recollect the report received on Wednesday last from the chairman of the Grantham election committee. In that report evidence was disclosed, satisfactorily showing that notice had been duly served on the individuals who refused to give their attendance. The notes of the short-hand writer had been read, and fully bore out the evidence so disclosed. He thought, therefore, that the subsequent conduct of the individuals alluded to could be regarded in no other light than as a gross violation and contempt of the authority of that House, and as an obstruction to the discharge of those duties which the House had imposed on its committee. As such, however averse he might generally be to measures of rigour, he thought that in furtherance of justice, and to provide against future obstructions of the same kind, the House was bound to animadvert severely upon it. He should therefore now move, "1. That it appears to this House, that sir W. Manners, bart. has absconded, in order to avoid being taken into custody, pursuant to an order of this House.—2. That an humble address be presented to his majesty, that he will be graciously pleased immediately to issue his Royal Proclamation, with such reward as his majesty shall think proper, for discovering, apprehending, and detaining the said sir William Manners."—Similar resolutions with regard to Mr. Jervis were put and carried.
 Mr. Bernal  rose to enter his protest against the renewal of this measure. Doubtful as its policy was at any time, a strong case ought indeed to be made out, in order to show that it was expedient in the fifth or sixth year of a general peace. The first bill of this kind which parliament had ever sanctioned was the 33rd of the late king. That bill was passed in order to guard the country against the innovating principles and doctrines of the French
 293
 Colonel Davies  said, it was now, as had been observed by his hon. friend, about twenty-seven years since parliament had first been asked for an extension of those powers that had been previously deemed sufficient for the welfare of the country and the safety of the constitution. When this odious measure was first heard of within the walls of that House, France was in a state of actual revolution—its monarch dethroned—its religion abjured,
 294 295
 The Hon. J. W. Ward  said, that though it was unpleasant to continue a debate in which no arguments had been offered but on one side, the bill was, in his opinion, so discreditable to the ministers, so discreditable to the House, and so discreditable to the country, that he could not help saying a few words against it; and the more so, because he thought it was only by the earnestness, zeal, and perseverance of the opposition to it, that the country could ever be delivered from this measure, and that they had thus far to congratulate themselves, that it was on account of that opposition that they had not a perpetual instead of a two years Alien bill. It was a bill to deprive foreigners of that degree of favour, protection and countenance which they enjoyed in this country, he would not say in ancient times, for that might admit of dispute, but without question in that time of our history to which every man looked back with most satisfaction, and which might be most conveniently taken as an example. He really could not understand after all that had been said on the subject, on what reasons were offered to them, this bill, which might affect the interests, and which affected so directly the character of the country. Was it for the protection of our own government, or was it for the protection of foreign governments? When it was last proposed to them, four years ago, they were told that Europe was still over-run with Jacobins, some Republicans, some Napoleonists, all michievous in the extreme; they were told to look at the Netherlands, where, till an Alien bill had been introduced, the work of sedition had been carried on by wholesale, by these pestilent enemies of all established authority. After that, what had happened? In that very year, many of those exiles were recalled to France; and, in the next year, the king of France, the head of that government which we were professing to protect by that bill, said his wish was, to forgive and forget, and suffered almost all the others of these exiles to return to their country. The consequence was, that the Netherlands

 Mr. Bathurst  argued against the observations of the hon. member who had just spoken, contending, that experience and practice were opposed to the speculation and conjecture of that hon. member, when he maintained that English Jacobins, or by whatever other name those might be called who desired the overthrow of the government, had no disposition to seek assistance from congenial spirits in other nations; for it must be recollected, that when the enemies of our government were most anxious for the attainment of their object, they made an appeal for assistance to the National Assembly of France. But, if gentlemen would look to the general conduct, or rather to the uniform system of the disaffected of this country, they would find them resort to every quarter of the world where any symptom of a similar spirit appeared. It was, indeed, notorious, that every movement of insurrection or disaffection to established governments thoughout Europe, served as a motive, an example, and an encouragement to those who had the same views in this country. Could any one doubt, that if any disaffected persons in any nation

 Mr. Maxwell  said, that having supported this bill on a former occasion, he thought it necessary to explain the reasons for which he was induced to oppose it on the third reading. On the former occasion, the queen had not arrived in this country, or, at least, no measures affecting her honour and character were fore this House, nor had those, en-

 The Lord Mayor , in rising to offer an explanation on a subject to which the attention of the House had been called by the hon. member for Aberdeen, regretted that the hon. member was not present to hear his justification. He could assure the House that nothing had been farther from his mind than to call in the military for the purpose of overawing the livery or his fellow-citizens. His sole object in taking the precaution for which he had been blamed by some persons, was to preserve and protect the citizens of London; and for this purpose the military had been placed in the neighbourhood of the city—not within it, as had been erroneously stated. He had thought it prudent, on this occasion, to post soldiers in places contiguous to the city, lest any evil-disposed spirits should think fit to renew such outrages as had been committed in the mayoralty of alderman Wood, when shops were broken open, arms were stolen, and acts of violence and bloodshed were committed. With this example before him, he had

 Lord A. Hamilton  said, he wished to know whether it was to be considered as a permanent part of the system of laws of the country? It had been continued from year to year, almost as a matter of course, advantage being taken of the comparative indifference with which the House looked at what professed to be a temporary measure. In the same manner the act for the seizure of arms in Ireland had been continued for ten years by five distinct renewals. This Alien law also had been now continued five or six years since the peace, and was to be continued for two years longer, at the end of which time it was likely to be just as necessary as as it was now, for not a single argument had been now adduced in favour of it.
 Mr. Hume  expressed his surprise and regret that sir H. Parnell had not succeeded in obtaining the appointment of the committee for which he had moved some time ago, as had that motion been agreed to, ample evidence would have been adduced to show that every impedi-
 301
 Mr. Beaumont  rose to give notice of an address to his majesty, praying that the Royal Coronation might be suspended until the termination of the proceedings now pending against her Majesty.
 Sir H. Parnell  argued forcibly against the bill, the purport of which was, a general and indiscriminate renewal of all the duties upon all manufactures transmitted from one country to the other. When these duties were originally laid, they were for the avowed purpose of introducing and establishing manufactures in Ireland, and this, however erroneous it might be deemed, was a distinct and general object; but the right hon. gentleman, in proposing the further continuance of these duties said, he did so, in order to protect capital that was vested in their manufactures. This was certainly a very different motion from that which originally gave rise to those taxes. But the right hon. gentleman has not stated any distinct case to show where the capital was so invested as to require this protection, and this should be done before the continuance of such duties was agreed to. For where duties of this nature were not necessary for the protection of Ireland, they must operate as direct taxation upon that country. From the representation of the deputies of the Irish manufacturers who had communicated with the right hon. gentleman, it appeared that they could have no desire to continue the taxes, or what were called protecting duties, upon plated ware or pottery, for as these articles consumed in Ireland (there being no manufacture of them), were imported into Ireland from this country, the duty referred to only served to impose an additional tax upon the Irish consumers. Therefore it was desirable that pottery and plated ware should be wholly omitted from the schedule annexed to this bill. But there were other articles in this schedule to which he must request the attention of the committee, and upon the necessity of excepting which he could offer various arguments if time were allowed for due consideration. From the thin state of the committee he did not deem it proper to enter into the subject at any length, but he felt it his duty to state as briefly as
 302 303
 Sir Robert Heron  informed the House that he understood sir William Manners had surrendered himself, and was then in the custody of the serjeant-at-arms. The two individuals also, H. Manners, esq. and W. Atter, who had been ordered to attend were then in attendance. Knowing, as he did, that the evidence of the two latter was no longer wanting before the Grantham committee, and remembering the lenity which the House seemed disposed to exercise in their case, as having acted without an independent will of their own, he should conclude with moving, that the order for their attendance be discharged. The House would recollect, that A. Jarvis, another person who had refused to attend the notice of the committee, was on Saturday last committed to Newgate. He believed that he should shortly have to present a petition in his behalf. With regard to sir W. Manners, it was not his intention to submit any motion.
 Mr. Wynn  was of opinion that, considering the view which the House originally took of the situation in which the individuals who were the subject of this motion stood, there was equal ground for at present exercising the same lenity.
 Mr. Wynn  thought there was but one course to pursue, and that the House was clearly bound to act as it had done in the case of Jarvis. He therefore moved, "That sir William Manners, baronet, having absconded, in order to avoid being taken into custody pursuant to the Order of this House, be for his said offence com-

 Sir T. Acland  said, he could bear testimony to the merits of sir W. Adams. It was worthy of attention, that many persons who had received pensions for life on account of blindness, had been since cured by sir W. Adams.
 Lord Palmerston  said, he had felt confident when the subject was before under discussion, that Mr. Bennet would do as he had done, state simply and plainly what he had seen. The question as to the manner of granting the pensions was before the Chelsea board.
 Mr. Barham  observed, that sir William Adams had failed only in those cases in which the subjects had been pronounced incurable by other oculists; but even in such cases that eminent oculist had afforded relief.
 Mr. Hutchinson  said, he had felt it his duty from what he knew of the melancholy disease which gave rise to this institution, as well as from what he had heard of the distinguished individual under whose superintendence it was placed, to visit that institution, and he was at once astonished and gratified by the result of his observation; for he found that several gallant men who had bled in the service of their country, and who had, in the opinion of other surgeons, been totally bereaved of sight, were quite recovered, while the worst cases were considerably ameliorated. Having witnessed such cases, he could not forbear from making the statements which upon a former occa-
 322
 Mr. Grant  remarked, that there could be no doubt whatever of the attention of the lord lieutenant to the decision of that House.
 Mr. Bankes  observed, that the conduct of the prisoner was, according to his own confession, so grossly disgraceful, that it would be obviously indecent to allow his continuance in a judicial or any other office of trust or consequence.
 Mr. Grant,  understanding the office which the prisoner held was one of annual election, and that such election would take place in September, subject to the approbation of the lord lieutenant; had no hesitation in stating that this approbation would not be granted to the election of the prisoner after what had transpired in that House.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that after what his right hon. friend had stated, and as the election for the office which the prisoner held would take place at no distant period, he thought there could be no objection to the motion. 324
 Lord Castlereagh  said, as he understood the hon. and learned gentleman to have commenced his speech by saying, that he would not enter into any discussion of the general merits of this bill, he should certainly imitate his example, and apply himself more to the consideration of the clauses which the hon. and learned gentleman had proposed than to the general observations into which he had digressed, notwithstanding his promise at the commencement of his speech. And here he could not help remarking, that it was easy for any hon. and learned gentleman to assume that nothing had been said on his (lord Castlereagh's) side of the House in support of the measure which was now before it; and if such an assumption were afterwards to be insisted on as a truth, it would be a convenient mode of arguing, and a cheap method of acquiring a victory. If, however, such a mode of arguing were to be held satisfactory, and if assertion were to be deemed equal to truth, he might meet the assertions of the hon. and learned gentleman opposite with others of his own, and might say, that the arguments formerly urged in defence of this bill had not only been satisfactory to his (lord Castlereagh's) mind, but also to those of former Houses of Parliament. It was from knowing how convincing those arguments had appeared to those who had sat in former parliaments, and also from knowing how widely those arguments had been discussed, and how generally approved by all who had attended to them, that he had deemed it unnecessary to inflict a repetition of them upon the House on present occasion, especially as no arguments had been advanced by the opponents of the measure, which had not been a thousand times advanced, and as often refuted; and therefore, if he had abstained

 Mr. Calcraft  begged to call the attention of the House to a subject which came to his knowledge on Saturday. He understood it was intended to build barracks in the Regent's Park for 437 men of the Life-guards, in lieu of the barracks in King-street, Portman-square. That fit barracks should, if necessary, be built, he had no objection; nor had he any that the Regent's Park should be the spot selected. But he thought the terms upon which those barracks were to be erected rather novel. The expense of erecting them was to be defrayed by annuity. The reason for this was, that the sum paid for the buildings now occupied by the soldiers was 5,400 l l l l l 356 l
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he considered there was a good reason for accepting of the contract before them. If the regiment in question were to have been removed from London, it might perhaps have been argued, that so large a sum should not have been expended for their accommodation But if any garrison whatever were to be kept in London, the Horse-guards surely ought to be preferred, their good conduct being justly admired and praised. It was about eight years ago since a proposition for building a barrack for that regiment in the Regent's Park had been made; the estimate of the expense amounted to 120,000 l l l l
 Lord Binning  was surprised at the nature of the objection. Had his right hon. friend been compelled to ask a vote for a large sum of money, there would have been a colour for the opposition offered. Here it was proposed to effect a considerable object, by most convenient advances, from time to time, on a fair estimate, and finally the public would reap the advantage by having acquired a specific property in the buildings thus erected.
 Mr. Williams  did not see any reason why this regiment should have been quartered at London. If ministers would look at Croydon, they would find barracks there, built at great expense, almost entirely empty. He saw no reason for going to the enormous expense for the erection of new barracks.
 Mr. Gordon  reprobated the grant, as one which must ratify an usurped privilege on the part of ministers, as well as sanction a most suspicious transaction. He objected to the principle laid down by the noble lord, as repugnant to that of our ancestors, who thought the best security they had for their liberties consisted in their maintaining closely the connexion between the citizen and soldier, and not treating the interests of one as separated from those of the others.
 Mr. Tennyson  said, he should be the last person in the House who would undervalue the warrant of the Speaker, and would ever be found among the first to maintain its due authority and dignity; and if he had been permitted to proceed, he was persuaded he should not have been called to order, and that, as it appeared to him, in a manner which seemed to imply some reproach—he might almost venture to say reproof, which he did not feel he deserved, merely wishing to discharge his duty. As to what he had said respecting the witnesses not being called, he had referred merely to the counsel and parties interested for the sitting member, and not to the conduct of the committee; and he had wished to observe also, not for the purpose of defence, but with a view to the mitigation of punishment, that if he might reason by analogy to the practice of courts of law, where a party could not apply with effect to the court against a witness who refused to attend on a subpoena, unless he accompanied his application by an affidavit that the person who refused to attend was a material witness.
 Mr. Tennyson  said, that on a former occasion he had interfered in favour of sir W. Manners, conceiving that as he had been selected as nominee in the committee for his son, it might fairly be expected of him as an incidental duty. He unfeignedly agreed in what had fallen from the hon. baronet who had moved an amendment, for the absconding certainly did not appear in the evidence on the Journals. The House should also know, that though it had been applied to on behalf of the sitting member to enforce the attendance of sir W. Manners and others as material witnesses, yet they had not been examined, though in attendance the whole of that day, which had brought the pro-

 Mr. Canning  said, that his hon. and learned friend, in alluding to the administration of king William, and to the ministers under whom the law of habeas corpus was enacted, had asked, whether they might not have met the great measures which had been alluded to in the same way as his hon. and learned friend's propositions had been met? whether the same arguments would not have been equally applicable in either case? He would answer no. But in the case of any measure directed virtually against a pending proceeding, and upon which the arguments (though not perhaps on the part of the mover himself, yet certainly on the part of those who supported him) were derived from the assumed character of the existing administration—for his own part, he could not think, that, in such a case, it was so monstrous for ministers to suppose (nor did he perceive how they could be accused of
 351 352
 Mr. Canning  said, he found himself in a situation of considerable difficulty; for if it was the privilege of a member, on moving a clause, to conclude the debate by a reply, as in the case of a motion, then he was precluded by the practice of the House from offering any observations in answer to those of his hon. and learned friend. As his hon. and learned friend's proposition was in the shape of an amendment, and not of an original motion, it appeared to him (Mr. Canning) that what his han. and learned friend had just said could not be deemed a reply.
 Mr. Canning  said, he only desired to set himself right with the House on this point; and to show his hon. and learned friend that he had no wish to take advantage of the right which the forms of the House allowed him, he should wait till the first of the motions had passed.
 Mr. Canning  observed, that as that was the case he would proceed, with the intention, however, of limiting his remarks within a very small compass. His hon. and learned friend had abstained from answering that which was transcendantly the most important part of his noble friend's speech—namely, that the proposed clause, was to prevent an abuse of such a nature that if his majesty's present ministers were supposed capable of permitting it, they were unworthy to remain for a single hour in that capacity, and ought not merely to be restrained, but to be driven with scorn and indignation from their offices. His hon. and learned friend had said, that he had drawn this clause
 345 346 347
 Mr. Dawson  said, he was one of the members of the committee before which the prisoner had been guilty of gross prevarication; and without desiring to interfere with the rights of the corporation of* Limerick, he could not help saying that such a person should not be allowed to remain in any judicial station.
 Mr. Abercromby  declared, that if an opinion were to be formed of the talents, judgment, and discretion of the administration from the speech of the right hon. gentleman, those who opposed the administration could not wish that question should be put on a better issue. It appeared to him that his hon. and learned friend's proposition deserved to be received by the House of Commons with a far different temper than had been displayed by the right hon. gentleman. The object of the clauses proposed by his hon. and learned friend was, to secure to foreigners on coming to this country, ignorant as they must be of the nature of the constitution, of the feelings of the people, of the securities on which they were to depend, not only for their case and comfort, but for their personal safety while in the country, such a certainty of being protected as would place them beyond all fear and doubt on that head. If the members of the House of Commons, satisfied with the knowledge of the British constitution, felt assured that there would be no danger attendant on the arrival of those witnesses, who would undertake to aver that similar feelings prevailed in the bosoms of men coming from a far distant country, to a nation which they looked upon with prejudices, to a people of which they entertained strange notions? That House might know that the power entrusted by the bill to government would not be abused; but how could that knowledge be conveyed to foreigners? On the recent landing of some foreigners the people of the place where they landed, with

 Mr. Daly  thought the prisoner should resign the office which he held.
 Mr. Daly  said, that as the office which the prisoner occupied was subject to annual election, and as that election must be sanctioned by the lord lieutenant, there could be no reason to apprehend the reappointment of the petitioner after the decision of that House.
 Mr. Daly  said, that he presented the petition, as that petition was couched in language respectful to the House; but he had no desire whatever that the petitioner should continue to occupy a judicial office.
 Sir James Graham  said, that he understood sir W. Manners had left his home before the order was made for taking him into custody. By the evidence of the messenger it appeared, that before the House debated upon that order, sir W. Manners had gone from his usual place of residence at Buckminster, and could not justly therefore be said to have absconded. He trusted, as some misconception seemed to have prevailed, that the House would not deem it necessary to adopt the motion, and should move that the order for his attendance be discharged.
 Mr. J. P. Grant  said, it appeared as if the ministers thought they were for ever to be continued as such; or, at all events, during the proceeding against her majesty. But whether that might be the case or not, of one thing, at all events, he was sure, that in conferring such a power on his majesty's ministers, they were con-
 355
 Dr. Phillimore  was persuaded, that if the hon. baronet were apprised of the resolutions to which the House had already come upon this subject, and the course which it had hitherto pursued, he would not have brought forward his amendment. It appeared in evidence, that sir W. Manners had set at defiance the order of the House, and had actually barricadoed his doors for the purpose of preventing its execution. He must remind the House likewise, that they had already punished one person for similar conduct, and that person the servant of sir W. Manners. Could they with any propriety liberate the master, after they had sent to prison an individual dependent upon him, and who, from his station in life, could hardly be so well acquainted with the nature of the offence he had committed. He felt assured they would deal out equal justice, and should only observe in addition, that it was not on a report of the committee that they were proceeding, but that the House had satisfied itself by an examination at the bar.
 Mr. R. Martin  said, with respect to the general question of continuing the Alien act, I vote for that proposition for those reasons that have been so ably urged by the noble lord. Now, as to the third resolution, which is supposed necessary to protect the witnesses of her majesty, I am compelled to give to that resolution not only my negative, but my hearty reprobation; and I do this more from motives of regard to the queen than of justice to the government. The object is not to prevent any foreigner in the interest of the queen from being sent away, for I am bold in this assertion, that her majesty the queen's defence will depend on those witnesses that are to be brought into the country through the exertions of the noble lord, and not on any now liable to the provisions of this act. Is there one man so lost to truth as to say, he doubts the assurance given, that my noble friend will exert every power, direct and indirect, to procure the presence of every person deemed necessary to the queen's defence. Again, is there a man who will not allow, that without such assistance it would be difficult at least for her majesty to be prepared for her trial. As the queen's friend (if I may be so bold), I do protest against this resolution, because' it would surrender the effectual pledge already given, and substitute an idle, in-

 Mr. Denman  observed, that when he entered the House, he had no idea that the resolutions now before the House were to be proposed. But he could not help stating the reasons urged in support of that clause, formed a strong ground against the existence of such a bill, and unless the

 Mr. Wellesley Pole  said, he understood the hon. and learned gentleman to say, that what passed at Dover was a manifestation of public opinion.
 Mr. Wellesley Pole  replied, that he should always bow to the chair with that respect which was due to it when it was
 338
 Mr. Wellesley Pole  observed, that he had a right then to consider the hon. and learned gentleman as avowing it.
 Mr. Wellesley Pole  was proceeding to make some further remarks on what had fallen from the hon. and learned gentleman, when
 Mr. Wellesley Pole  said, he should not trouble the House at any length upon the merits of this question, but he could not forbear making some observations upon what had fallen from the hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down. That hon. and learned gentleman had intimated that a suspicion existed in the country that the ministers did not intend to act with the utmost justice and delicacy towards her majesty. The hon. and learned gentleman who had proposed these clauses, and whose talents, eloquence, and candour, he admired upon all occasions, had however stated, that no such suspicion existed in his mind. The hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down asserted in round terms that a proof of the suspicions which the public entertained of his majesty's ministers was to be found in the outrageous violence which had been exhibited at Dover towards certain individuals who landed there, because it was supposed that they came for the purpose of giving evidence on the approaching important state proceeding. Did the hon. and learned gentleman call that act the expression of public opinion? It was the act of a rabble. He (Mr. W. P.) readily allowed that the rabble were hostile to the present administration. He hoped they always would be so. It was a proof that the present administration had acted with energy, and had successfully supported the dignity of the Crown and the interests of the country. But, on account of this abominable and scandalous outrage which the hon. and learned gentleman chose to consider the expression of public opinion, the House of Commons were called upon to throw a slur on government, in the face of the public and the world, by indicating such a suspicion of government as to withhold from them the powers with which they had formerly been entrusted. He wholly subscribed to the declaration of his noble friend, that if his majesty's ministers were found attempting, what — not the hon. and learned gentleman himself, but, according to him, the public suspected they would attempt—if they not only did not take no means to prevent persons from coming forward to give evidence for her majesty in the pending proceeding, but if they did not give
 337
 The Speaker  interfered, and reminded the right hon. gentleman of the great inconvenience that might arise, were the rules of the House to permit any hon. member to refer to particular expressions used in former debates.
 The Speaker  said, the original question before the House was, "that the Speaker do leave the chair;" and therefore, unless that motion were withdrawn, the proposed instruction must be considered an amendment.
 The Speaker  said, that the question which he must first put was, "that the original words stand part of the motion;" and if, on that question, the House determined that he should leave the chair, the right hon. gentleman would have no opportunity of speaking on the question.
 The Speaker  spoke to order. It was subversive, he said, of the authority of the House that a person called upon as a witness by a warrant of the House, should take upon himself to refuse obedience to that warrant, on the consideration whether or not he was a material witness; and therefore it was disorderly to urge as an excuse the circumstance stated by the hon. member. Also, if observations were permitted on the manner in which an election commitee executed its duty, it could not be foreseen how far interference with committees might be carried.
 The Speaker  again spoke to order, and said that the hon. member had much misunderstood the observations which he had felt himself called upon to make: nothing was farther from his wish or intention than to convey the slightest reproof to the hon. member, and he regretted that he should have thought so; but he had a strong impression that the subject matter of the hon. gentleman's speech was disorderly, as conveying the idea that a difference should be made by a person to whom a warrant was issued, in the obedience which he might pay to it by the consideration whether it was or was not necessary that he should attend. 321
 Sir J. Mackintosh  expressed a doubt whether the prisoner should be released without some assurance that he would be removed from the office of recorder of Limerick.
 Sir J. Mackintosh  rose, not with a view to oppose the motion, but in order to suggest the condition in which this unfortunate individual was placed by his own conduct. He did not mean to interpose between this individual and the proposed lenity of the House. This individual admitted that he was guilty of prevarication on oath, and as he was a member of a liberal profession, it would be for those who composed that profession, to consider whether it were fitting that he should be allowed any longer to belong to such a profession. But without desiring to aggravate the suffering which the reflections of his own mind must inflict upon this individual, he must observe upon that which was material to the public. This indivi-
 323
 Sir J. Mackintosh,  in moving the third resolution, begged to make one or two observations, in answer to what had fallen from his right hon. friend First, it was remarkable how strictly his right hon. friend applied the proposed resolutions as personal to himself and his colleagues. He seemed to consider himself and his friends as the permanent immovable administration of the country, and that everything proposed was directed against them. Every measure which was brought forward, in opposition to their views or feelings, his right hon. friend appeared to consider as affecting them in a personal manner. Every measure which might even be thought to affect the hon. and right hon. gentlemen, however remotely, his right hon. friend seemed to think a personal affront, and a very ungentlemanly proceeding. The possible abuse of power generally seemed to be totally lost sight of. Among other things, his right hon. friend regretted that the subject respecting the queen should have been introduced into this question. From that discussion, however, he (sir J. Mackintosh)
 348 349 350
 Sir J. Mackintosh  said, that in the few observations which he was about to submit, he should confine himself to that clause which had been chiefly discussed, and which he considered by far the most important of the three —he meant that which was intended to afford protection to the foreign witnesses for and against the queen. It was not his intention to attempt to follow the right hon. gentleman opposite through the various points
 342 primâ facie 343 344
 Sir J. Mackintosh  begged to consult the Chair on the subject, and to be informed whether the moving of an instruction to a committee entitled the mover to the privilege of a reply.
 Sir James Mackintosh  said, he merely rose to disavow all personal suspicion of the ministers, while he begged leave explicitly to avow a constitutional jealousy of the power now vested in them.
 Sir James Mackintosh  rose, not to oppose the question that the Speaker do now leave the chair, nor yet to enter into any discussion on the general merits of the bill then before the House. He had expressed his opinions upon that question so frequently upon former occasions, that he felt himself perfectly justified in not repeating them at present. He had another motive, of a much more powerful
 325 326 327 328 329 330 331
 Mr. Scarlett  said he had no intention of disavowing it.
 Mr. Scarlett  felt considerable surprise at the very extraordinary speech which he had just heard from the noble lord. For, what was the argument of it? That the power given to ministers by this bill was so odious, that it was a gross libel and a wicked calumny upon them to suppose that they could ever employ it. Why, if this argument were to be allowed for a moment, the ministers might in a short time ask for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act upon a similar principle. They might address parliament to the following effect—"For God's sake suspend the Habeas Corpus act—for God's sake give up your right to a trial by jury—for God's sake repeal all your most valuable laws. The power we shall gain by such measures will be so odious and abominable, that it will be a libel upon us to suppose that we shall abuse it, and therefore you will be in quite as good a condition as you are at present." But could any thing be more ridiculous than this line of argument? He, for one, thought not. The noble lord had misrepresented the arguments of his hon. and learned friend. His hon. and learned friend had not proposed these clauses for the purpose of insinuating any calumnies against his majesty's ministers; on the contrary, he had distinctly stated that his object was, to repel such calumnies. He (Mr. S.) could not believe that the noble lord would make any improper use of the powers conferred by this bill; yet it was extremely possible
 335 336
 Mr. Scarlett  allowed that his meaning had the tendency supposed by the right hon. gentleman, but trusted that he was incapable of using some of the words imputed to him. He had called the right hon. gentleman's colleagues weak, vacillating, and incapable of administering the affairs of the country in the present crisis. Their acts and measures fully justified his having so characterised them, and he would so characterise them still. He said this without intending personal disrespect to any of the individuals of whom the administration was composed: but as a member of parliament, he was entitled boldly to declare his opinion of their conduct as a body.
 Mr. Scarlett  rose to explain. With respect to the conduct of the populace at Dover, he had not intended to adduce it as the expression of the public feeling, he had merely mentioned it as having been first alluded to by the noble lord, with whom he would unite in condemning it as highly reprehensible and improper. What he had observed was, that a great many persons out of doors might entertain suspicions of the intentions of government, which certainly were not entertained by himself. He no more considered the sentiments of such persons to express the public opinion, than he considered the votes of that House to express the public opinion.
 Mr. Scarlett  confessed that he really did not know what expression of his had warranted the construction which the right hon. gentleman had put upon his words. He might be allowed to say that he had himself a little stake in the property, and could not therefore be indifferent to the welfare of the government of the country; but no man was ever less sanguine than himself in expecting, or thought any thing less likely to happen, than the dissolution of the present administration; for he thought they would not dissolve until the country did; and that the country would be dissolved by them; and no doubt had he but many persons would support them until it came to that crisis. He denied that any paramount necessity had been imposed upon ministers to adopt that course of proceeding on account of the mere circumstance of the queen's return, which the right hon. gentleman himself had so feelingly lamented, or to put the parties in that state which the whole country so deeply deplored. It was in this view that he had characterised the present as a weak administration. What other epithet could justly be applied to them? He contended, that the moment his majesty's ministers had admitted that great question to be one capable of negotiation, they had themselves given the lie to those who had maintained that a paramount necessity existed for following the course that had previously been taken. If any gentleman was of opinion that he, in the warmth of debate had shown any prejudice or party feeling on the subject, he wished to set himself right. He could assure the House, that he entertained no such feeling. He wished to see justice impartially done. He could not help stating, that he felt compassion, strong compassion for the situation of her majesty, but he also entertained a strong feeling, for the peace and tranquillity of the country, which he conceived were endangered by the proposed investigation.
 Sir J. Newport  strongly condemned a proposition of this sort having been introduced at the close of a session. He condemned the mode proposed as changing altogether the principle upon which the country had heretofore acted with respect to barracks. The right hon. gentleman had said, that if the House should not approve of paying an annuity of 5,400 l l
 Lord Palmerston  said, that instead of asking to raise a sum of 70,000 l l
 Colonel Wodehouse  informed the House, that the Grantham borough election committee had determined, that James Hughes, esq. was not duly elected. That the last election for the said borough, so far as relates to the said James Hughes, esq, is a void election. He further informed the House, that the committee had come to the following resolutions:"1. That it appears to this committee, that, at the last election for the borough of Grantham, James Huges, esq, by sundry acts of treating, did act in violation of the statute of the 7th of William 3rd, cap. 4, whereby he is incapacitated to serve in parliament upon such election. 2. That a practice has subsisted for several elections, in the borough of Grantham, of paying sums of money to the out-voters, under colour of indemnifying them for loss of time; and the committee are of opinion, that the said practice is highly illegal, subversive of the

 Mr. Bennet  said, there had been a misrepresentation in the Morning Chronicle with regard to what had passed the day before in that House, on the subject of the Ophthalmic hospital. A long speech had been made for his hon. friend the member for Cork, in which his hon. friend was represented as referring to what had fallen from him. Now, of the whole matter thus imputed to his hon. friend not above three sentences had been uttered by him, and these were incorrectly stated. He himself had not said that his former opinion was erroneous; and all he did say was that three medical persons had dissented from the opinion of sir W. Adams. He certainly had recently visited the hospital, and found only 69 patients. Three only were dissatisfied with their treatment; but it was, as he understood, without reason.
 Lord Castlereagh  thought the House ought not to be called on to decide upon such a motion  instanter.
 Mr. Wynn  said, there were two standing orders—one passed in 1666, and the other in 1669—relating to this question. The first provided, that no member of the House of Commons, and who was of the long robe, should act as counsel before the Lords; the second reserved to the House the power of granting exemption. The present case seemed to present sufficient ground for exercising this power, provided an entry was made on the Journals of the special circumstances attending it. He agreed, however, with the noble lord, that it would be better to give some notice.
 Sir F. Burdett  said, they ought to take care that they did not surrender their just rights by a partial proceeding. He under-
 365
 Lord J. Russell  rose, pursuant to notice, to move for an address to the Crown, praying his majesty to shorten the term of the imprisonment awarded to sir Manasseh Lopez. Some persons erroneously supposed that he wished to do away with the punishment altogether; but these individuals did not recollect that sir Manasseh had already paid a fine of 10,000 l 368 369 l l
 Mr. Wynn  felt that it was extremely unpleasant to oppose a motion of this description, and to endeavour to thwart the disposition of lenity which the House might feel towards any particular offender. Every gentleman must wish to show mercy and forbearance, as far as justice would permit; but the case in point was not one in which consistently with their duty, with the forms of parliament, and with propriety, they could interfere. Cases might exist, in which the House might in justice be called on to advise the Crown to interpose, and to exercise its prerogative of mercy, in the same way as they might offer advice with respect to any other prerogative; for the House had a right to
 370 371
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he was not quite sure, but he believed that this was the first time that a question like the present had been brought before that House. He believed that this was the first case in which that House was called upon to interfere with the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy; and what had taken place in the course of the debate, seemed to show to what consequence the adoption of such a motion was likely to lead. The motion was no doubt honourable to the feelings of the noble lord, but the precedent was peculiarly to be deprecated, which the acquiescence of the House in such a motion was calculated to establish. It would better become the House to leave the prerogative of mercy where it was fixed by the constitution, and not to press a proposition of this nature. Whether the law should have its execution was the peculiar prerogative of the Crown, and the responsible servants of the Crown could not be justified in recommending the interposition of the royal mercy upon the mere suggestion of that House (he spoke it with perfect respect) any more than upon the application of the humblest individual in the land. Although feelings must always be excited corresponding to the circumstances of particular cases (and particularly ill health was calculated to excite commiseration), could they conceive a place where such feelings could be less properly expressed than in that House? The noble lord had not meant to make his motion of general application, but to limit it to this particular case; yet that case at once brought forth another. If an inter-
 372
 Mr. Gurney  hoped that both the cases mentioned on this occasion would be attended to. Mr Swann's case was infinitely the strongest; he had been convicted only upon two counts out of twenty-three in the indictment against him, and that too in consequence of his not having pressed for the payment of a 20 l 25 l
 Mr. Grenfell  concurred with the right hon. gentleman opposite; and as there appeared to be an understanding, that due consideration would be given to the case of sir M. Lopez in the proper quarter, he hoped his noble friend would be induced to withdraw his motion. He also trusted that the case of Mr. Swann would be taken into consideration at the same time with that now before them.
 Lord J. Russell  said, if he understood the statement of the noble lord, this case was already under consideration [No, no]. Well, then, he must understand that whether his motion had been brought forward or not, there were at present no impediments in the way of taking the case under the consideration of the Crown. He was satisfied with this declaration, He stated at the commencement of his observations, that there were some obstacles and difficulties in the way of a fair consideration of this case by the Crown; but as the noble lord had assured him that those difficulties would be removed, he was ready to admit that the case would be much better taken into consideration in the
 376
 Dr. Lushington  said, it would be in the recollection of the House that he had given notice of a motion for the production of copies of any official communications relative to a negotiation between the French government and that of Buenos Ayres for the establishment of a Bourbon dynasty in South America. It appeared to him to be of very considerable importance, that those documents should be laid upon the table of the House. The documents alluded to respected a correspondence which had taken place thirteen months ago. Since he had given his notice, he had had time for reflection on the subject, and he was fully satisfied in his own mind that it was his duty not to postpone his motion, late as the period of the session was. If he could suppose that his motion would embarrass negotiations with foreign powers, he should be extremely sorry, however strong his political bias might be, to agitate any question that might prove detrimental to his country. The subject to which he alluded was an extraodinary production, originating with the secretary for foreign affairs in the French government, in May 1849. At the conclusion of the session of parliament, we had been assured from the throne, that the most amicable relations were maintained with foreign powers. Yet at that very time was one foreign government devising a plan of the most insidious and unwarrantable nature, which if it would not subvert, would materially injure our commercial prosperity. At the very time when we were assured of the continuance of amicable relations with foreign powers was the secretary for foreign affairs in
 377 378 379 380 381 382
 Lord Casllereagh  objected to the motion, on the ground that the information alluded to by the learned gentleman had not reached government in such a shape that it could be laid on the table; and ob-
 383 384 385
 Dr. Lushington  replied, and said, he was-not, under all the circumstances, inclined to press his motion, and would therefore, with the permission of the House, withdraw it.
 Mr. Hobhouse  said, that though it was the fashion to insist that the people were inflamed by demagogues, he would contend that they had never entertained any such designs as to warrant ministers in adopting measures like that before the House. At this moment the standing army was 92,000 men, while Cromwell had been able to keep down a disaffected population with not more than one-third of the force. New barracks were constructing in all di-
 395
 Mr. Williams  supported the bill, because he conceived volunteer or militia regiments the most constitutional force that could be used for the preservation of the public peace. He was adverse to a large standing army, and therefore it was that he supported the measure.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  could not say whether the act was done by the dean and chapter or by parish vestry. As to cutting down the trees, he apprehended the same had been done on former coronations.
 Mr. Bankes  said, that the cutting down of those trees for a sordid purpose, reflected any thing but honour on the reverend body. He would not vote in future, for any money for the repairs of Westminster Abbey; and he thought the House should resist any such vote if it should be proposed.
 Mr. Brownlow  disapproved of interfering with the prerogatives of the Crown. Though he felt how much pity was due to the case, he would oppose the motion; but be hoped the circumstances mentioned on this occasion would have their effect elsewhere.
 Mr. Ellice  implored government to bestow its most anxious attention on the British interests in South America. At that moment an interposition in behalf of our trade might be attended with the utmost advantage. The magnitude of that trade at present was very great; in fact, from Mexico to Cape Horn, all were supplied with British manufactures by British traders, and not only was that trade very great, but there was a new branch opened between the west coast of America and England direct, which he had no doubt would, if the East India restrictions were done away with, arrive at a very great height. He derived great consolation from the earnest tone assumed by the noble lord, and by the right hon. gentleman; and he was sure that the States of America would require protection in any negotiation with Spain, for maintaining the freedom they had acquired. If any improvement was to be expected in the trade of this country; if relief was to be looked for in any quarter for our desponding manufacturers, it must principally be by extending our commerce with South America.
 Mr. Canning  hoped that, when it was considered that this motion, if it failed, must become an impediment in the consideration of the case elsewhere, and if it was carried, must be fertile in occasioning questions of a similar nature, in that House, which was the most unfit place in the world for such discussions, the noble lord would be convinced of the propriety of withdrawing his motion. If there had existed any where an impression that an impediment arose from any prejudice supposed to exist in the House, that impression must be removed by the discussion that had now taken place, and the noble lord might believe that his motion had thus had sufficient effect. The removal of what was supposed to operate the other way be earnestly hoped would satisfy the noble lord, without pressing his motion to a division, which could not be beneficial.
 Mr. Canning  opposed the motion as quite unusual under the circumstances of the case. It was for papers which in fact were already in the possession of both sides of the House; but as yet it could not be said whether the information stated in them was or was not correct, and this he thought sufficient to show that it could not be acceded to. His hon. and learned friend seemed to impute to his majesty's ministers a total want of all that sensibility to the national honour for which he gave himself and his hon. friend, the mover, credit. On the hypothesis of the validity of the document in question, government might be disposed to feel as strongly as the hon. mover and his hon. and learned friend; but although it might be perfectly harmless, or even beneficial.
 391 392
 Mr. Brougham  brought in his bill, "for better providing the means of Education for his Majesty's Subjects," which was read a first time.
 Mr. Brougham,  in rising to move, that it be read a second time to-morrow, said, he wished to notice, and to allay an alarm which, he understood, his bill had excited amongst two very numerous and highly respectable classes of his majesty's subjects—the Protestant Dissenters and the Roman Catholics. The House would hardly believe the extent to which this alarm had gone, especially when they recollected the observations with which he had introduced the plan. It was supposed, in consequence of the system being connected with the Protestant ecclesiastical establishment, that it was intended to compel children of various denominations to attend Protestant worship. This feeling had operated so powerfully, that some members of these two respectable bodies had addressed queries to him on the subject. It was asked by one party, whether it was not true (a point, he begged leave to observe, directly contradicted by the report) that it was intended to compel Roman Catholics to send their children to Protestant schools and Protestant worship? and certain dissenters seemed to consider this as a bill introduced for the purpose of "rooting out the last remains of religious liberty in this country." With respect to the Test act, as it affected dissenters, he would offer no observations on this occasion. But he thought the expression "to root out the last remains of religious liberty in this country," was exceedingly strong, when the dissenters were allowed, by an annual indemnity act, to get rid of the sacramental test. He would, however, tell those individuals, and if any of them happened to be present, he hoped they would recollect the declaration, that there was not a man in the House, nor in the country, more decidedly adverse to any thing harsh or intolerant than he was. Nor was
 366
 Mr. Brougham  said, if it could not be regarded as a matter of course, he would give notice for to-morrow.
 Mr. Brougham  said, he was sorry that it should be viewed in that light; he had himself deemed it a matter of course, and had not anticipated any objection. The consequence of not acceding to his application would be, that no member of that House would hereafter appear in cases of appeal or writs of error at the bar of the other House, as, in duty to his client, he should feel himself compelled to enforce the standing order upon every occasion.
 Mr. Brougham  said, he wished to bring under the consideration of the House, a matter immediately falling within the scope and intent of two of its standing orders. With a view of protecting themselves against great abuse, every member of that House had been prohibited, by those standing orders, from attending as counsel at the bar of the House of Lords; The first standing order referred to common law proceedings, and the other to judicial proceedings by bill. These rules were laid down at a period when it was necessary to raise their privileges to a high ground, and the practice had been during the last century, ever since the year 1710, for members of that House to attend without let or hindrance, in their profestional capacity in the House of Lords. This, however, had not been the case with respect to bills; and for the best reason—because those bills had been or must come before them as members of parliament. Still, if the principle were extended to all cases whatever, great inconvenience must arise—an inconvenience that must be obvious from the mere etiquette of the profession. Another purpose for which the standing order was framed was to guard against an improper influence with respect to private bills exercised in the other House by the members of that; and he certainly had no wish to open the door wider than it now stood for the admission of such bills. His proposition now was, that the case he had to submit furnished fair ground for an exception to the rule. It was on behalf of her majesty's law officers that he made his appeal;
 364
 Mr. Abercromby  declared, that if the noble lord now found the way for mercy more easy, he had no wish to say any thing further; but that, if the question should come to a division, he should feel bound to vote against it. He wished the matter to be left with the Crown, and its responsible advisers. The grounds on which the motion was brought forward were not sufficient. A plea had been set up, that the offence was common. He did not agree in the propriety of it; but if it had weight, it should have been considered before the House proceeded to call upon the courts of justice to pronounce judgment. It was too much to say that that House, after having prosecuted, should turn round and say sentence should not be executed. He could not view any argument used on this question but as an impeachment of the sentence. It seemed to him, that it would be an act of extreme impropriety in the House to interpose, because no fact had been offered which was not known before. There was, besides, this material consideration—there was, on such prosecutions, nothing of willingness, either in the Crown or the judges, to proceed. It was generally conceived, that prosecutions ordered by that House were cases in which there was obvious reluctance in other quarters to proceed against the offence. If such were the general character of the cases, it could not be favourable to the interests of justice for the House to thwart the opinion of the judges in affairs submitted to them by the House. The whole argument resolved itself into a complaint of the severity of the sentence. He wished the House to remember the time when, in cases of libel, the punishment of imprisonment was inflicted for years upon years to a frightful amount; and yet no word of interference had been attempted in the House. He begged pardon, one member had ventured a word. The late Mr. Whitbread, of whom he could never think but with reverence and esteem, had incidentally mentioned one. of those cases, and well did he recollect the exclamation of all against
 375
 Mr. R. Martin  said, he was sorry to trouble the House with any thing that referred personally to himself. On a former occasion he had brought under their notice a breach of privilege with which his name was connected in "The Morning Herald" newspaper. At that time he had refrained from making a complaint, and merely mentioned the subject by way of admonition. He had afterwards seen the gentleman, who avowed that he was the person who reported his speech on that occasion. Indeed, the gentleman, when he spoke with him, talked of his situation and condition very unreservedly. But he (Mr. M.) was not prepared to put the matter to issue on the principle of a trial by battle. The gentleman used the following expression;—"In future, Mr. Martin, you shall have no cause of complaint; we shall lay down the pen when you speak." What he said then was, that he should be very much obliged to him not to report his speeches at all, if they were to be done in the way he complained of. In the same paper of this day the reporter had made him utter sentiments which it would not become any man to use who was not a fit subject for a certain receptacle. In consequence
 363
 Mr. Creevey  said, he had hoped that the bill would have been removed altogether from the table. He contended, that the measure was a part of the military system ministers were establishing throughout the country. The embodying an army by the East-India company was one of the last acts towards a military despotism he had expected. Ministers were now repeating what they had done 25 years ago, with this difference; that then an army was embodied to fight the French; now, it was marshalled to subdue a distressed population. It had been said, that the disaffected had brought these military measures upon themselves; but such an assertion was both indiscreet and unjust, since parliament itself had been the great instrument of oppression. The real nostrum to cure discontent was economy and a removal of the burden of taxation; yet instead of doing so, the East-India company, itself a grievance to the mercantile interest, by monopolizing the trade to China, was made to raise a force to support the government, which supported them. It would be much more becoming in the company to reduce their expenses, and look forward to the day when their charter would not be renewed. He would move, "that the bill be read a third time on this day six months."
 Mr. Burrell  observed, that sir M. Lopez was overwhelmed with domestic affliction, which, with his confinement, had made a deep impression on his health and constitution, and had brought him near to the
 374
 Mr. Money  said, that Mr. Swann had two children at death's door, upon whom he was incapacitated, by his imprisonment, from bestowing his attention at so awful a time. He would support the motion.
 Mr. Money  said, it was not now the time to enter into the question whether the East India Company was a grievance or not; it was sufficient for him that it existed under the sanction of parliament. The force in question was not of a new description, but was composed of men who were under the obligation of self-interest to unite the character of good citizens and good soldiers. It was a measure to enable the Company to protect the immense property in their warehouses, and at times to afford their aid to the civil power.
 Mr. W. Peel  supported the motion, and urged, that the same measure of mercy should be granted to Mr. Swann, who had been lately re-elected to that House, in a manner that was equally honourable to his constituents and to himself. There had also been a serious calamity in the family of Mr. Swann, since his imprisonment commenced, which formed an additional claim to the generous consideration of the House. If some remission of his sentence were extended to Mr. Swann, it would, under such circumstances, be a most seasonable and acceptable indulgence.
 Mr. W. Smith  said, he had no doubt that what his learned friend had stated with respect to the feeling of the Roman Catholics was true. But, if it were not for his learned friend's declaration, he should have conceived it impossible, looking to the feeling which pervaded the House, that the Roman Catholics could have adopted such a monstrous idea as that Protestant schools were to be established, and that they would be obliged to send their children to those schools. His learned friend had neither said nor insinuated any such thing, but the very reverse. With respect, however, to the Protestant dissenters, he was well aware that much alarm prevailed amongst them as to the general structure and bearing of the bill. But that alarm had not, as far as he knew, induced them to go so far as to use the expression which his learned friend had quoted, or any thing like it. He knew
 367
 Mr. W. Smith  said, it was shameful to see the manner in which the inspection of the interior of this edifice was, as it were, let out by two-pences; no one felt more disgust at such conduct than he did; but the dean and chapter could not be expected to lay out, as the public had done, 41,000 l
 Sir J. Mackintosh,  in explanation, complained that his right hon. friend had strangely misrepresented him. In the first place, in speaking of aid from military force, he had distinctly said, that the Spanish people had delivered themselves with little aid from regular military force of their own; it was far from his intention in that expression to allude to the British army, of whom he had always spoken as
 393
 Sir James Mackintosh  was sure that honourable gentlemen would be disposed to concur with him in thinking it a matter of profound regret, that a subject of such immense importance should have only been able to command so thin an attendance of members, and so languid an interest, as it seemed likely to excite. He did not know what might be the exact cause of so unfortunate a difference in the opinions of members of that House upon
 386 387 388 389 390
 Sir J. Yorke  concurred with the noble secretary for foreign affairs. The case of Mr. Swann was certainly the hardest.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  said, that early in the next session he would bring under the consideration of the House, the state of Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  said, he wished to put a question to the right hon. gentleman opposite. A number of fine trees which had long stood an ornament in St. Margaret's Church yard, had been recently cut down, and he was informed that they were cut down for a reason disgraceful to the dean and chapter of Westminster; they were cut down, if he were rightly informed, for the purpose of creating a space intended to be let at a high price to persons who might be anxious to view the coronation. Those trees had stood for many years an ornament to the venerable fabric which they shaded; and as to the fabric itself, on looking into the interior of Westminster Abbey—on viewing the state of those monuments, which were an ornament of the age, and an evidence at once of the gratitude of the country, and of the high heroic and patriot virtues which called that gratitude forth—it was, he said, most painful to see the disgraceful manner in which those monuments, as well as the interior entire building, were neglected.
 Sir J. Newport  said, the dean and chapter had all the advantages, whilst the public were obliged to meet the expences of Westminster Abbey. He considered the neglect of that fine edifice as most scandalous and disgraceful, and a fit subject for the reprobation of that House. If on any occasion an application should be made to parliament for the repairs of Westminster
 396
 Sir T. Acland  felt desirous of establishing an inference that, whatever became of the motion, the Crown, in consequence of its having been made, would feel more at liberty to extend mercy respecting a sentence occasioned by the interposition of that House. It was that circumstance that distinguished this case from all others, and exempted the interference of the House from the character of strange anomaly which would belong to their conduct if they interfered with the royal mercy in general cases. In the present case the House had made itself the prosecutor—as far, at least, as the judgment went; and he hoped that the punishment would go far to prevent practices that tended to corrupt the country in the exercise of its best rights. He could not therefore understand why the House could not interfere as any other prosecutor might, for mercy. Another consideration, if not for taking away the crime, at least for
 373
 R. A. Jervis  was brought to the bar, where he received the following Reprimand from Mr. Speaker, and was ordered to be discharged out of custody: 397
 Mr. Abercromby  would not pronounce any decisive opinion upon this resolution, beyond saying, that as the case stood, he thought it clear it ought not to be put without serious consideration. If the law as it now stood was decisive on the point, the resolution was unnecessary. If the law were doubtful, surely they did not mean to set it right by a mere declaratory resolution.
 Dr. Phittimore  observed, he had not said the law was doubtful, for it was quite clear money could not be legally given in the manner it had been given at this election.
 Mr. Wynn  said, he could see nothing doubtful in the proposition. The bill, which was before the House some time ago, did not relate to loss of time, but to travelling expenses. Even the payment of those expenses was, in his opinion, illegal. The giving meat or drink upon the road was evidently an offence against the Treating act, and ought to render the election void. The only question here was, whether the pains of bribery were incurred, or whether it was a minor offence? If, as there was reason to believe, a mistake was prevalent on this subject, it ought to beset right by a declaration of the House—a course which had been repeatedly followed on similar occasions. If the practice of giving money for loss of time were tolerated, it would be much better to repeal at once all the statutes against bribery at elections.
 Mr. Wrottesley  thought the present course objectionable. It was not so clear to him that remuneration for loss of time in going to vote was so decidedly against the law as the hon. gentleman thought. At all events, he had strong objections to this mode of settling the law by a declaratory resolution.
 Mr. W. Smith  said, the case was so clear that he had at first thought the resolution unnecessary, but the doubts which he had heard raised convinced him of the necessity of it.
 Mr. Lockhart  thought the resolution was
 399
 Mr. Warren  agreed with the views taken by the hon. member who spoke last. The House ought to take care that every resolution which it passed should be binding on its committees. By a declared opinion, such as that which they were invited to come to, they would appear as if attempting to make law, and to control the effects of an act of parliament. He thought the proposition, to say the least of it, crude and ill-digested.
 Mr. Wynn  explained. He had said, that every payment of money to an elector for loss of time was distinctly illegal. It was not only an offence against the statute, but against the law of parliament, as frequently laid down in the resolutions of that House, and which he would maintain it was the duty of the House to lay down, without waiting for the concurrence of any other authority.
 Dr. Phillimore  said, he had brought forward the resolution as the organ of the committee in the absence of the chairman. An inveterate practice had been proved to subsist in the borough of Grantham, of giving 7 l l 400
 Lord Castlereagh  said, the case of the queen was so peculiar, it was of such transcendent importance, that if there were two honourable members in that House to whose legal care her majesty wished to intrust her interests in the House of Lords, it was quite sufficient to state that fact to induce the House to dispense with the standing order, and to grant the necessary leave. But he conceived the same privilege should be conceded to the other side, if gentlemen, members of that House, were called on to exercise their talents in support of this important bill. In that case it would be proper that the individuals thus selected should exercise their functions in that House with the same reserve, and with the same understanding, that the gentlemen opposite would exercise their's; namely, that they should discuss the question professionally, and not interfere by
 401
 Mr. Wynn  said, it was necessary that a special permission should be granted to members of that House to appear at the bar of the House of Lords, if they acted in conformity with the standing order. It appeared, on reference to the earliest period to which their Journals reached, that it had been the constant practice to allow no member of the House of Commons to attend at the bar of the House of Lords without the special leave of this House. So early as the year 1694 several cases of this kind occurred. In one of these the Speaker stated, as a ground for this permission, that, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, the same principle had been acted on, and he had himself been permitted to appear before the Lords. The extreme inconvenience of extending this system was, however, evident; and therefore the House ought to be cautious in granting such permission. It was highly desirable that members should come to the discussion of bills In that House with minds completely unbiassed; and when they had acted as counsel in the other House, whether for or against a bill, they could not be supposed to be wholly unprejudiced. It was on this ground that the resolution of 1666 was entered into; which resolution he took to be strictly declaratory of the law of parliament on the subject. It was a matter worthy of the consideration of the House, whether it would not be proper that this standing order, which only extended to bills coming to that House from the House of Lords—bills which had not originated in the House of Commons—should be made to apply to all bills whatsoever. The inconvenience that might result from the existing state of the order was obvious, since members of the House of Commons might be retained to act as counsel on a bill, when it came before the House of Lords, with a view to obtaining their previous assistance in the Commons. The possibility of such a circumstance ought to be guarded against. Permission to ap-

 Lord Castlereagh  did not think that any distinction could be drawn between the case of the king's attorney and solicitor-general and that of the attorney and solicitor-general of her majesty. The king's attorney and solicitor-general were officers appointed to act in great public prosecutions, and had a right, as officers of the Crown, to exercise their legal functions in
 403
 Mr. Wynn  expressed his apprehension, that notwithstanding the concluding provision of the noble lord's motion, the adoption of it was but too likely to be drawn into precedent in other cases in which the Crown might feel an interest in supporting any measure in the House of Lords, while in the former motion no such apprehension could be entertained, as no such case was likely to recur, and this formed another marked distinction between the two motions.
 Mr. Williams  remarked, that the noble lord had not coupled with his motion any statement that the king's attorney and solicitor-generals should not vote upon the bill of pains and penalties in that House, if such a bill were brought down from the other House of parliament.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that he had stated at the outset that such was the distinct understanding.
 Mr. Bennet  rose for move for the production of the minutes of the evidence taken before the finance committee of last session, upon the conduct of the Audit Office. The committee, he said, had taken no notice of the question of fees, a subject which had been minutely investigated in the report of the committee in 1810. The right hon. gentleman had produced a bill, in which certainly some fees were abolished, that is to say, two fees; one of 2 l s. l s. l l l
 Mr. Davies Gilbert  said, that there was certainly some part of the evidence which the committee had held back, and they had done so, because they felt that the production of this evidence would have a tendency to affect private feelings, and expose private differences without producing any beneficial result to the public. With respect to the establishment of the Audit-office, a very large mass of accounts was now in progress, and would be brought forward at no very

 Mr. Hobhouse  said:—Sir; I feel more than usual reluctance in offering myself to the attention of the House on this occasion. I observe that this great question is treated with a neglect and indifference for which I am at a loss to account, Even the noble lord, the father of this measure, seems to have left it to its fate—[here lord Castlereagh entered] I am glad to see that the noble secretary has thought it worth his while just to comedown and attend upon his own offspring, although he will not deign to protect it. No, Sir, he will offer no excuses, no pretexts, for prolonging this odious, this unconstitutional enactment. Thrice has he been called upon by some of the most distinguished members of this House, to give some reasons for continuing this bill; but he has been called upon in vain; and like another considerable character, not in real but dramatic life, he will give no reasons "on compulsion"—no, "not if reasons were as plenty as blackberries." Sir; I have not the vanity to hope that I shall extort from him that which he has refused to others much more likely to make his lordship speak; but although lam well aware of my own incompetency, and although I know the almost proverbial folly of "arguing with the master of twenty legions," still a sense of duty induces me not to withhold from the House my sentiments upon a question so materially affecting the rights, and, what is more, the character of the English nation. Sir, it seems resolved, on the other side of the House, that we shall accept this proposition, as if it were self evident. Let me beg the House to remark how entirely the friends of the measure have abstained from any thing like a new argument, although there is nothing which assimilates present circumstances to those which] formed the excuse of former alien bills. We have had just three speeches on this bead—one from the noble secretary of state

Swift, unbespoken pomps thy steps proclaim, And stammering babes are taught to bless thy name." 411 412 413 "——Britannos hospitibus feros." 414 415 416 "Hᔣcest in gremio victos quae sola recepit.'
 Mr. M. Fitzgerald  complained of the regulation respecting the importation of Irish spirits as being most injurious to the Irish distillers, and a palpable infraction of the Articles of Union.
 Mr. D. Brown  agreed with his right hon. friend, that the act of Union was in this instance violated. He complained of the conduct of the chancellor of the exchequer as amounting to a breach of national faith: the clause which he had first introduced carried the appearance of benefit to Ireland, but the hope that had been raised for a moment was about to be extinguished.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  maintained, that in the whole of this question he had acted for the public at large, and without regard to any particular interests. He held it to be material to prevent, as far as possible, the consumption of spirits of an extraordinary strength, and such was his object in this bill. In Ire-
 418
 Mr. C. Hutchinson  concurred with his right hon. friend in thinking that justice would be done to Ireland, but was of opinion that the chancellor of the exchequer did not understand the question. Ireland had, according to the act of Union, a right to import the spirit without any alteration or reduction into the English market, and therefore he could not see the necessity for any investigation by a committee.
 Lord Castlereagh  concurred with the opinion expressed by the hon. gentleman. There ought to be but one feeling, to do what was right and just, and he hoped his countrymen would never form themselves into a body, in opposition to the interests of Great Britain. No arrangement could be expected to be permanent which was contrary to the rights of either party. It appeared to him that his right hon. friend's clause was either nugatory, or worse than nugatory; and he submitted to him, that it would be more advantageous to confine-the measure at present to what the law confessedly was, and to let that law take its course till their meeting after the adjournment.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  consented that the bill should pass without this proviso.
 Mr. M. Fitzgerald  said, the discussion on this question had not originated with the people of Ireland, who had only come, after a long period, to claim a remedy against an infraction of the act of Union. If a measure equivalent to this clause, violating in spirit, though not in letter, the article of Union to which he alluded, should be brought forward at any future time, he should feel himself perfectly at liberty to protest against it. He hoped the explanation of the noble lord was distinctly understood; and that the chancellor of the Exchequer would not introduce any measure to contravene the concession that had been made.
 Mr. V. Fitzgerald  expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the fair and candid statement of the chancellor of the Exchequer.
 Mr. C. Smith  supported the bill.
 Mr. Brougham  would not oppose this motion, although he was at a loss to conceive upon what ground it was proposed. It was observed by the noble lord, that the attorney and solicitor-general were counsel for the public as well as for the Crown. But every member of the House of Lords was, as well as every one of the judges, of counsel for the public, while it must be allowed that the Crown had quite enough of representation in that House in the great officers of state. Where, then, was the necessity for calling in the aid of the king's attorney and solicitor-generals?
 Mr. Brougham  said, he rose, pursuant to notice, to move that he and his learned friend should have leave given them, as her majesty's attorney and solicitor-general, being members of that House, to appear in her behalf at the bar of the House of Lords. The learned gentleman moved, "That leave be given to her majesty's attorney and solictor general, members of this House, to plead as counsel at the bar of the House of Lords against the bill now pending in that House concerning her majesty, under the particular circumstances of the case; and that the said leave be not, in time coming, drawn into a precedent." The learned gentleman observed, that he had introduced the latter part of the motion, because the House would recollect, that their order was more especially directed against private bills than appeals, and he thought it was proper that the salvo should be co-extensive with their standing order.
 Mr. Monck  strongly condemned the bill. He considered it to grow out of a mysterious and undefined attempt to hunt down the liberal minded men—the whigs of the continent—who  were 417
 Mr. Huskisson  contended, that the footing on which the matter would now rest was very fair,  viz.
 Mr. W. Smith  thought that the letter of the act of Union might operate against its spirit in this instance, and quoted the authority of Mr. Pitt in support of the con-
 419
 Mr. Shaw  spoke against the clause, and insisted on the right of Ireland to the benefit of the clause adopted in 1817.
 Sir R. Wilson  said, he had heard no arguments to make him view the bill in a more favourable light than he formerly did. He was glad the clauses which had been proposed had been rejected, as he thought it better the bill should pass with all its obnoxiousness about it. Of one thing he was certain, that whilst it continued to be the law of the land, the millions of the continent would consider this country as at war with their liberties.
 Sir J. Newport,  after stating the claims of the Irish distillers, maintained that the law, as it existed in 1817, ought to be preserved, and as Ireland must submit to the disadvantages arising out of the act of union, she was entitled to its benefits also. He expressed a full conviction that justice would be done to Ireland, though the members of that country did not exceed one hundred.
 Mr. Caleraft  said, he would oppose the bill in every stage. Though the money to be voted for this object was trifling, yet in the present state of the country every 1,000 l data
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  agreed with the hon. gentleman, that in the present situation of the country, any expenses which could be avoided ought not

 Lord Nugent  said, it was no matter where the barracks were to be built, for how much or for how little money; he objected to building any new barracks. He objected to them for the precise reasons for which the noble secretary at war had recommended them. He thought it highly unconstitutional to destroy the connection between the citizen and the soldier; he thought it essential to our liberties, as well as consonant to our constitution, that "a circulation of feelings and interests, according to the constitutional language of Judge Blackstone, should be kept up between the army and the people, between the citizen and the soldier." Without this connection no country's liberties were safe while it kept up a standing army. He was not ashamed to avow these opinions, although they might be out of fashion in that House. They had been the feelings and opinions of the greatest men who had distinguished this country—of sir G. Savile and lord Chatham. They were the opinions of one whose writings, genius, eloquence, and public spirit cast a lustre over the period in which he lived—he meant sir William Jones. He wished the public opinions of that great man, enforced as they were by his virtuous life and his profound learning, were engraved in letters of gold in that House. The noble secretary at war had thought it desirable that a corporate spirit should be encouraged by means of barracks in the army. But this spirit he thought most dangerous in time of peace. It proceeded from the worst principles; it led to the worst events. It led to a military government. The military governments of the continent were all crumbling around us, and we ought, therefore, to apply the adage to ourselves. The only military government that remained undisturbed was the Turkish government, and it continued so because it was fortunate enough to shut out civilization and intellect. Where civilization

 Lord Nugent,  in seconding the motion, observed, that the principle of exclusion from office, on account of a difference in religious opinion, had always appeared to him an anomaly in a free constitution and an enlightened age. He himself had a petition from that respectable body the Roman Catholics of England; and in declining to present it this session, he was influenced only by a consideration of the awful and immediate importance of that question which now engaged the public mind. He must, however, be permitted to say of it, that it contained a most satisfactory answer to the often-renewed charge of a divided allegiance.
 Mr. W. Smith  said, he had to present a petition from a respect-

 Mr. Hothouse  said, he should, in the next session, bring before the attention of the House, the situation of a class of his majesty's subjects which might, and ought to be ameliorated. They had last night heard mention of the situation of the Catholics and Dissenters; he should shortly call their attention to the situation of the Jews, who now laboured under disabilities which would be hardly believed to exist in such an age as this, and especially in London, and other cities of the empire.
 Mr. Calcraft  said, he had learned that one reason for the great expense with which the building of these barracks was to be attended was, that a wall was to be built inclosing a large tract of ground. He wished to know how many acres were to be thus inclosed.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  allowed that the building of a boundary wall formed a considerable item in the estimate. He did not know the quantity of ground inclosed, but he believed it was eight acres.
 Mr. Calcraft  thought it was most improvident to spend a large sum in building a wall round eight acres of land for the accommodation of 400 men. He should divide the committee on the main clause.
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, the wall was to be built round a piece of ground for the exercise of the troops. The barracks in question were not like those in Hyde Park, near a place where they could exercise their horses, as the whole of the Regent's Park was laid out in inclosures or plantations.
 Mr. Wilson  said, that if new barracks were to be built, they certainly ought to be built with the utmost economy. In the present case the wall seemed to him to be superfluous, and he was of opinion that the whole contract betrayed great mismanagement. If the money had been raised at the present market rate of interest, the country would have been burdened with an annuity of only 3,000 l l
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  rose to state to the committee his plan for regulating in future the process of distillation in Ireland. The plan would consist of three parts, and with regard to each of them he should submit a resolution on the groundwork of a distinct legislative measure. The first would relate to large stills, of a capacity to contain 100 gallons; the second to smaller stills, not working above 2,000 gallons in the year; and the third to the more effectual prevention of illicit distillation. The right hon. gentleman particularly observed, with respect to the last measure, that it would enable persons to seize unlicensed stills, and, having done so, they must apply to the grand jury of the county, who were to make a presentment for their remuneration, which would be subject to the revision of the judges. The right hon. gentleman concluded by moving, "That the chairman be directed to ask leave to bring in a bill to provide for the more effectually collecting and securing the duties on spirits distilled in Ireland, in stills exceeding 100 gallons."
 Mr. Chichester  said, a number of Irish members had waited with great anxiety to know what measure the right hon. gentleman intended to propose with respect to small stills. Their expectations were, however, disappointed, since it appeared that small stills were not to be allowed within twenty miles of the greater stills, and also that the small distiller was to be restricted to the distillation of 2,000 gallons yearly. The manufacture of spirits, to that extent would not pay the distiller the fair interest on his capital. There was another objectionable point in this new plan. It appeared that the instrument to prevent fraud with reference to the strength of spirits, was to be applied to small stills only, while the owners of those of large capacity were allowed to do as they pleased. The effect of this would be to deter men of small capital from entering into a pursuit where they were likely to be met by such powerful competition.
 Mr. Hutchinson  hoped that the suggestions which were thrown out by different members for Ireland, on this very important subject, would be weighed and properly appreciated by the chancellor of the exchequer. That right hon. gentleman was undertaking a very difficult task—the task of regulating the spirit trade between the two countries. If he could assist the revenue, and at the same time satisfy the distiller, he should rejoice very much at his success. Any regulation by which

 Mr. Grant  remarked, that the case referred to by the gallant general was that of an officer, who, having been found guilty of an assault, had suffered the proper punishment. He was afterwards tried under lord Ellenborough's act, with another person, for wounding a man, and he was capitally convicted. His case was afterwards considered, and, on the recom-
 477
 Mr. Grant  was surprised that the gallant general should have made these conservations at so late a period of the session, particularly as a petition had been presented on the subject, and a bill was afterwards proposed which had been suffered to drop. He was not ready at that moment to enter on any debate respecting the conduct of the excise-officers, but he should be obliged to the gallant general if he would restate the circumstances relative to a person being wounded.
 Mr. C. Calvert  thought this pretence for building a high wall round eight acres of ground was absurd. There were near

 General Hart  said, that three persons, who were in the pursuit of individuals engaged in illicit distillation, had overtaken a man in a pass, with a wall on one side and a river on the other. The man surrendered to their command, and yet one of the officers shot him through the body. This officer, he should observe, had been previously tried and convicted of an assault.
 General Hart  did not think the present measure would be useful. The quantity of spirits which the small distiller would be allowed to manufacture would produce so small a profit, that few individuals would embark in the trade. With respect to the still-fine system, it placed the country in a situation almost as bad as if it were invaded by a foreign enemy. Persons had been appointed to the situation of collecting officers of the worst character. On a former occasion he had stated the case of a person who had been wounded by one of the individuals to whom he had alluded, but who had afterwards been pardoned, although condemned in a public court of justice.
 Mr. P. Moore  presented a petition from Olive Serres Wilmot. The petitioner stated herself to be the legtimate daughter of the late duke of Cumberland; she asserted that she possessed a document to prove the solemnization of a marriage between her mother (who was Julia Wilmot, the

 Sir H. Parnell  said, it was trifling with the House and with the country to propose a vote of this kind at a moment when economy was so loudly demanded in every department of the state.

 Mr. Hobhouse  rose to second the motion that the petition should be brought up. At the present moment the statements contained in it should, he thought, be especially noticed, when there was lying on their table a list of those members who were supposed to be returned by corrupt influence to that House. This was the more necessary, because the House of Lords were now about to give judgment on one of the most important measures that was ever submitted to the legislature —he meant the bill of Pains and Penalties. The House ought to take care, if that bill were brought down to them from the Lords, that it was not again submitted, in effect, though not in reality, to the same individuals, in the persons of those whom they had caused to be returned, by whom it had already been decided in the other House. If, as was stated in a petition which he had recently presented, 198 members were, in one way or other, returned by the influence of the House of Lords, what would the country think, should the bill of Pains and Penalties pass their lordships' House, when it was submitted to those whose elections were secured by such influence? People would be of opinion that the measure merely went through the same hands a second time.
 Mr. Robinson  entertained great doubts as to the propriety of receiving such a petition. No person was less willing than himself to interfere with the right of petitioning, but there were statements in the paper, the truth of which he could nut ad-
 481
 Dr. Lushington  said, he regretted extremely the absence of the noble secretary of state (lord Castlereagh); but he was, nevertheless, obliged in his absence to bring under the notice of the House a subject which he should rather have wished had fallen into other and abler hands. It became his duty, however, in consequence of the absence of her majesty's solicitor-general, private notice having been given to the noble lord to whom he had alluded, that such a motion would this evening be made—to submit the subject, which was one of considerable importance to the judgment of the House. The circumstances out of which the motion he was about to make arose were as follows. In 1808, his late majesty was pleased to order a service of plate to be made, which he afterwards bestowed on her present majesty, who was then princess of Wales. She continued to use it from 1808 to 1814, as her own private and personal property. On proceeding to the continent, in 1814, her majesty placed it under the charge of Mr. Mash, of the chamberlain's office. On her return to this country she caused application to be made for the restoration of the plate, which then became necessary for her use and convenience, and he greatly regretted to state that the lord chamberlain was pleased to authorize this answer—"that the plate could not be returned to her majesty, because it was the property of the Crown, as would be made to appear from official documents." Her majesty naturally felt herself greatly aggrieved by the treatment she had received from government; but little did she expect that, in a case where her comfort and convenience were concerned, nice points of etiquette would have been raised, for the purpose of de-
 478 479
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, if he had received the same notice of the learned gentleman's intended motion as had been given to his noble friend, he would have sought for information on the subject, and would doubtless have been prepared to give an explanation. He was, however, ready to state all the information which he at present possessed. It was unquestionably true that a service of plate was presented by his late majesty to the princess of Wales for her use, which service was placed in the apartments occupied by her in Kensington-palace; but that plate, having been paid for out of the civil-list revenue, could not be considered as the queen's private property, but as the public property of the Crown. He had, he conceived, some reason to complain of the course adopted by the learned gentleman, who had evidently taken the House by surprise. He thought it was extremely unfair to take advantage of the absence of one hon. member, in order to call on another to enter into an explanation, and also to enter into an engagement with respect to a transaction which the latter was not aware would have been brought before the House. He should therefore suggest, that the motion should be merely considered as a, notice for Monday.
 Dr. Lushington  said, that as the right hon. gentleman had stated that on Monday an opportunity for explanation would offer itself, he acceded to his proposition, and on that day would repeat the motion which he had just made, and which he now begged leave to withdraw.
 Mr. Hobhouse  said, on looking to the petition, as printed, he found that the list
 485
 Mr. Luskington  put it to the Speaker, as a point of order, whether, under the existing regulations of the House, the petition could be received? The petition stated that a number of members were not legally returned. Was it not, then, an election petition? And, if so,
 483
 Mr. Hobhouse  said, he had very recently presented a petition of a similar description, which was laid on the table. It did not indeed contain the names of the individuals who were unduly elected, but it recited the names of the peers who exerted their influence to send members to that House, and the places where that influence was made use of. Therefore it was, in some degree, opposed to the order to which the secretary for the Treasury had referred, but that circumstance did not operate against its being received. With respect to the list contained in this petition, he knew nothing about it. But what had been said ought not, he conceived, to prevent it from being laid on the table. Statements contained in other petitions, on different subjects, were occasionally untrue, but that did not cause their rejection. The interference of peers ought to be guarded against; this, he believed, was provided for by the statute of Westminster. If it were not to be discouraged, what was the meaning of the declaration in the Bill of Bights that "elections should be free?" Was it that they should not be free? that elections were to be influenced by peers, whose power, arising from their great property, was notorious? How would it appear to the country, at the present juncture, if this petition were refused? Even the present parliament might wish to stand well with the country, and the rejecting such a petition was not the best mode of effecting that object. The petitioner did not recommend resistance. He merely said, the necessary inference was, that their acts could not be considered fair and constitutional laws, as the members who passed them were not duly elected. If he had stated an intention to resist, he might be punished for it. The House ought, even in its magnanimity, to suffer the petition to lie on the table. If there were any insult in it, that was another thing; but, for his own part, he could not perceive any.
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow,  whose name was also mentioned, said, he owed it to the borough for which he was elected to declare that the town of Guildford was not a proprietary borough, in which the election was carried by the influence of any peer or peers. An assertion to the contrary was false and unfounded. He and his colleague were requested to come forward by a large body of the respectable electors. He repeated that the borough of Guildford was not governed by the influence of peers.
 Mr. Bright  said, he was totally ignorant and uninformed of the facts contained in the petition. He knew nothing of either of the boroughs alluded to by the members opposite, and, in presenting the petition, he thought the only thing he was bound to show was, that it was of such a nature as ought to be received by the House. The petitioner complained of an illegal practice, that of peers returning members to sit in the House of Commons. It was not necessary for him to state this as a positive and ascertained fact. It was enough for him to assert that there was a  primâ facie 482
 Mr. Bright  presented a petition from an individual who signed himself "James Mills, a British Freeholder." The petition was brought up and read. It commenced by complaining of the burdens imposed on the people, and of the enormous expenditure of the late reign, amounting to 2,300,000,000 l 480
 Mr. Lockhart  doubted very much whether this was not an election petition. It stated that a number of members were unduly elected, and it called on the
 484
 Mr. W. Dundas  felt it necessary to declare, as his name was mentioned amongst those who were said to be unduly elected, that he was returned to sit in that House in the most fair and uncorrupt manner.
 The Speaker  wished to state the circumstances relative to the petition which had just been referred to by an hon. member (Mr. Hobhouse). He was the more anxious to do this, because he was personally concerned in the transaction. The petition, on being presented, was brought up to the table, read short, and ordered to be printed. He was subsequently applied to, by one of the officers of the House, to know whether a list of peers, who were said to nominate members to that House, and which was affixed to the petition, should also be printed? He answered, that no motion having been made relative to that list, it was in the breast of the House to give or refuse an order for printing it, on application being made to them; and therefore he could give no opinion whether it should be printed or not. The petition was printed but the list was left out, and in that state it at present stood. It would be found that the petition was not all that was contained in the parchment laid on their table. There was also a list of peers who were said to interfere in the return of members of parliament, which, not having been read to the House, and, in fact; not being in possession of the House, he could not exercise any discretion, one way or the other, with respect to its being printed.
 Mr. Hutchinson  regretted that a subject like this, which had no connection with the merits of the great case, should be brought forward in the present agitated state of the public feeling. On the question of her majesty's innocence, he wished to be understood as having formed no opinion. He gave great credit to his noble friend for the candour of his avowal, that after the statement of the noble lord, the motion ought not to be persevered in; or, in other words, that the noble lord had made out a complete case. That frank avowal did his noble friend great credit. A more complete answer, or a more incontrovertible case than that of the noble lord, he (Mr. H.) had certainly never heard; at the same time he thought that the decorous manner in which the hon. and learned gentleman had that evening argued the question on his side, was very much to his honour. It would be presumptuous of him to use such language in speaking of the hon. and learned gentleman, did we not live in times in which, in the most grave assemblies, the most indecorous and improper behaviour and arguments were witnessed. From persons so misconducting themselves, the hon. and learned gentleman had honourably distinguished himself. Still, however, he could not help regretting the language which, according to those channels of information, by which what occurred there was so accurately conveyed to the public, had been
 515 unjust 516 "enfans perdus;" 517
 Mr. Plunkett  said, he held two petitions in his hand, relative to the claims of his Roman Catholic fellow subjects, which he did not mean at present to lay before the House. He would not expatiate on the subject to which those petitions related, but would rather apply himself to explain why he did not now intend to bring them forward. One of those petitions was from the Ro-

 Mr. Calcraft  felt himself compelled to renew his opposition to this measure. The right hon. gentleman had told them, that, unless this bargain was completed, the Horse-Guards would be without barracks. This he denied; because they might still occupy the barracks which they previously had. The right hon. gentleman had thrown the blame of this proceeding on the contractor, who was

 Mr. Sheriff Rothwell  appeared at the bar, and presented the petition relative to the proceedings against the queen, which had this day been agreed to by the lord-mayor, aldermen, and commoners of the city of London, in common-council assembled.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  said, the petition was agreed to by a very large majority of the common-council. Indeed, scarcely ten hands had been held up against it.
 Dr. Lushington  said:—I rise, in pursuance of the notice which I gave to the House on Saturday, to move an

 Lord Castlereagh  regretted very much that he should have been absent on Saturday when the hon. and learned gentleman first made this motion; but still more did he lament both the mode in which it had been brought forward, and the course which the hon. and learned gentleman had thought fit to adopt in his absence. He certainly had received a letter from the queen's solicitor-general, communicating the intention to bring this motion on; but he would leave it to the judgment of the House to decide whether it was customary to submit a motion to parliament on a subject so immediately connected with the interior economy of the royal family, without having previously exhausted every other reasonable means of attaining the object in view, and whether such a course was likely to produce the desired effect. He would not impute any improper motives to the hon. and learned gentleman. The hon. and learned gentleman had been pleased to give him credit for entertaining proper feelings and sentiments on the subject, and he was disposed to render to the hon. and learned gentleman the same justice; but, with every disposition to view the hon. and learned gentleman's conduct fairly and liberally,
 505 506 507 l 508 509 510 "Mr. Mash presents his compliments, and sends an inventory of the king's plate, and requests the same may be immediately packed up for the purpose of being kept in the Jewel-office, until her royal high-ness's return from the continent.' "Sir William Gell is commanded by the princess of Wales to direct that her royal highness's plate, in the care of the lord chamberlain s department, shall be delivered to Mr. Hooper, her agent, for the purpose of being sent to her as quick as possible, as she has at present an absolute necessity for its use. Dated at Geneva, September 28th, 1814." "That the lord chamberlain had no authority to allow any part thereof to be removed, as required by sir William Gell's order." 511 512
 Dr. Lushington  was persuaded that, after the various observations which had been levelled at him in the course of the present discussion, the House would have the candour and kindness to indulge him for a few minutes. He could assure them, that he would not occupy their attention by any answer to the noble lord's personal remarks on him, or on the exercise of his humble talents. His character, as a legal adviser of her majesty, had been wholly unsought for by him. However, as notwithstanding his humble abilities, her majesty had been pleased to honour him with her selection, he would endeavour to discharge, whatever share might fall upon him, of the duties of her majesty's legal advisers, with fidelity and zeal. The manner in which he had brought forward his motion on Saturday, had not been accurately described by the noble lord. The facts were these; and he thought that he owed it to his own character to state them. On Friday he, for the first time, became acquainted with the circumstances connected with the plate. It was then settled between her majesty's solicitor-general and himself, that he (her majesty's solicitor-general) should make a motion on the subject on Saturday. It was not until late on Saturday that he (Dr. Lushington) was apprised by his hon. and learned friend that he was compelled to leave town, and that the task must therefore fall on his (Dr.

 Mr. Hutchinson  was sure that the hon. and learned gentleman did not mean to put words into his mouth which he had never uttered; but he (Mr. Hutchinson) had distinctly stated, and he begged not to be misunderstood, that he had not formed any opinion on the merits of the great question. He was in the recollection of the House, if he had said of her majesty any thing which could justify the term of "fastidious opinions," which the hon. and learned gentleman had imputed to him by name—or at least as member for Cork. The whole of his argument had been confined to disapprobation of the advice under which the present motion had been made. He was convinced that her majesty supposed she had a right to the plate in question, but he decidedly disapproved of advice which tended to injure her majesty by the injudicious and imprudent agitation of the present question. It was totally unfounded to assert that he had said any thing to asperse the queen.
 Lord Archibald Hamilton,  although he was by no means satisfied with all the points of the noble lord's answer, he was ready to admit that in consequence of what had fallen from the noble lord upon the subject of this plate, the motion of his hon. and learned friend must fall to the ground. If he understood the noble lord right, he contended that his late majesty had not the power of alienating this Crown plate. If so, of course the queen could put in no claim of property for herself to plate so situated. He was perfectly convinced, however, that if her majesty had not supposed herself invested with the right of possessing this plate, she would never have put in the claim she had done respecting it. Her majesty had evidently all along thought the property to be hers, and provided for her own use. She had ordered it to be packed up; she had subsequently sent for it because she was impressed with that conviction. This opinion it now doubtless appeared was an error. If it were true that the late king never did order this plate for her majesty as a present, then, of course, there was an end to the claim which her majesty believed she had in this property. There were one or two observations, however, which he felt himself under the necessity of making in consequence of what had fallen from the noble lord. The noble lord had arraigned the conduct of the hon. and learned member who had introduced this subject very severely, and, he might say, unwarrantably, as coming forward with a complaint of an unusual kind, and unfit for parliamentary investigation, and the noble
 513 514
 Lord A. Hamilton,  in explanation, observed, that his hon. friend had interpreted rather too largely what had fallen from him. What he had said was, that he understood from the statement of the noble lord opposite, that the king neither had given nor could give any plate under the circumstances in which the plate in question was placed. But he coupled with that declaration a statement, that it appeared to him that the inference from the reasoning used by the noble lord was, that the king could on no occasion make a present of plate; from which inference he totally dissented.
 Mr. Stuart Wortley  declared, that he had never entered the House with more painful feelings than on that evening, impressed as he was with the conviction, that if the case which had been stated by the hon. and learned gentleman on Saturday were borne out by the fact, those who had advised his majesty on the occasion had rendered themselves deeply responsible for such advice. It was therefore a great relief to him, it must have been a great relief to the House, and even to the hon. and learned gentleman himself, to hear the satisfactory explanation of the noble lord. He hoped this circumstance would be a lesson to the public and to the House, and that they would guard against the attempts which were constantly making to delude and deceive, and to create a false impression on this subject. He felt called upon to acknowledge that,
 518
 Mr. R. Martin  opposed the motion.
 Mr. Huskisson  said, that it was not competent to the Crown to dispose of any property in the custody of the lord chamberlain, as the property of the Crown, without the sanction of its responsible advisers. If his majesty had been advised by the board of Treasury to dispose of any plate deposited in the Jewel-office, a warrant signed by the Crown and countersigned by the Treasury, would be the only legal instrument for the conveyance of that plate. But in the transaction under consideration, that had not been the case. He (Mr. Huskisson) happened to be in the Treasury in 1808, when orders were given to fit up apartments in Kensington-palace for her majesty, then princess of Wales. Application was made in the usual way to the lord chamberlain, for furniture and other requisites for those apartments, and as a part of those requisities, for a suitable service of plate. The latter part of the application had occasioned a considerable discussion between the lord Chamberlain and the Treasury. He (Mr. Huskisson) had suggested to the lords of the Treasury that it might be desirable, with a view to a diminution of the expense, to ascertain whether there might not be in the possession of the lord chamberlain plate not used. An inquiry was accordingly made, and it was ascertained that the lord chamberlain had in his possession, as property of the Crown, plate which hid not been used since the time of king William. That plate was remodelled, and appropriated to the purpose required. To suppose for a moment that it was a personal present from his late majesty to the princess of Wales was a supposition wholly unsupported by facts. When the plate was delivered, in 1808, an entry (as described by his noble friend) was made by the lord chamberlain, that it was his

 Mr. Calcraft  rose to make his promised motion relative to the disposal of brokerage paid for the stock transactions of the accountant-general of the court of Chancery. He observed, that the duties of the accountant-general were paid for not only by salary, but by a division of the brokerage (paid on stock transactions) with the broker usually employed by the court. Whether the sum thus received were great or small, he considered the practice an objectionable one. The accountant-general ought not to be remunerated in that mixed manner; he should be paid directly by salary.
 541
 Mr. Courtenay  did not intend to make any opposition to a motion of this sort, which, so far as it could be complied with, was almost a motion of course; but he wished to show how utterly impossible it was to comply with the motion, in the terms in which it was now conceived. By the act of the 12th of George 1st, which created the office of accountant-general, that individual was directed to perform, from time to time, all those operations respecting the funds of the suitors of the court of Chancery that might be deemed necessary. It was unquestionably a part of his duty to make all sales that wore directed to be made by the court; and it was obvious that, in the exercise of that duty, he was obliged to observe the strictest accuracy and attention. It was necessary that lie should proceed with entire accuracy; for the east mistake might occasion the transfer or the payment of a considerable sum of money to a wrong person, by which great confusion would be created. These were the sort of duties that officer had to perform, and he received, in remuneration, a salary of 1,500 l. 542
 Mr. Calcraft  said, he founded his motion on information contained in the report relative to the office connected with the court of Chancery, and not on any private feeling. If he could not get such a return as that which he had moved for, he must, of course, be satisfied with whatever return the court was able to make. He was restrained, by motives of delicacy, from bringing forward this motion during the life of the late accountant-general, and he thought it was rather hard, when motives of that description had operated on his mind, to be told, as an answer to his motion, that the present accountant-general had been only six months in office.
 The Marquis of Titchfield  thought the House would desire to hear the evidence of the medical gentleman alluded to, and therefore moved that Mr. William Hutchiuson Box, the surgeon of Newgate, be called in.
 Mr. Box,  surgeon of Newgate, was called in, and stated, that he had seen sir W. Manners this morning; that he was in a high state of mental irritation; that he had lost the use of his lower extremities, and of one of his arms, by a paralytic affection; and that he does not think he could be brought to the bar without great risk, on account of the general state of excitement and mental irritation under which he labours.
 The Marquis of Titchfield  thought that after what had been stated to the House, it would not hesitate to take the only course which occurred to him as proper to adopt. He deemed it unnecessary to trouble the House by enlarging upon the grounds which had been so fully urged, persuaded that the feelings they must have excited were in unison with his own. He should, therefore, move that sir W. Manners be discharged from Newgate on paying his fees.
 Mr. Tennyson  rose to offer an humble petition from an individual who had recently fallen under the displeasure of the House, and had for some days been suffering the punishment which it had inflicted upon him. The petitioner was sir William Manners. The House would recollect, that on the 5th
 549 550
 Mr. Tennyson,  on moving that the petition should he on the table, stated, that he had a certificate in his hand from the medical gentleman in attendance, which he would read, that the House might be apprised of what was to be expected from

 Mr. Abercromby  thought there could be no difficulty in procuring the return called for. The present accountant-general could make a return as far as his experience went; and, as the same broker had been employed for many years past,

 Mr. Lockhart  said, on the first introduction of this bill into the House, he was inclined to consider it favourably. But, comparing the calculations of the hon. member for London with the statements of the right hon. gentleman, and considering the expense of building a wall, including eight acres of land, as injuriously and unnecessarily enhancing the cost, he could not give the measure his support, but must strenuously oppose it. He had, however, various other reasons for opposing this bill. In the present dense state of the population, when the activity of the public mind was increased through the medium of the press, and when the extension of education had opened inlets to general knowledge, and the pressure of taxation had created discontent, he thought it was absolutely necessary for the safety of the metropolis, that an armed force of some kind should

 Mr. Wallace  brought up the report of the committee appointed to inquire into the state of our foreign trade. The hon. gentleman, in moving that the report be laid on the table, hoped the House would suffer him to make a few observations. He meant briefly to state the extent to which the committee had gone, and the objects to which they had chiefly directed their attention. Gentlemen would recollect that, in the former part of the session, many petitions were received from commercial districts, particularly one from a large and respectable body of merchants of the city of London, which had been presented by an hon. member (Mr. Baring), who usually sat on the other side of the House; and who, he was assured, would have been this day in his place, had he not been detained in the country by a very severe domestic calamity. Those petitions stated the general commercial distress which prevailed, without pointing out any immediate remedy for that distress. And, indeed, considering the state of our connexion with foreign countries, and the nature of the commercial system which had so long prevailed, it would be vain, he feared, to expect any immediate
 546 547 548
 Dr. Lushington  suggested that the paper could be procured either in the course of that evening or of to-morrow.
 Mr. Wetherell  rose to call the attention of the House to a paragraph in "Flindell's Western Luminary," reflecting severely on the conduct and character of her majesty. He thought it his duty to take this step, because it was impossible for the House to pretend to be ignorant of the nature of the bill which had recently been introduced in another place, or of the severe punishment which, if it were passed into law, it would inflict upon her majesty. The paragraph to which he alluded was one of the most gross attempts he had ever witnessed to pervert the course of justice, as it declared, in the most offensive terms, that the queen was actually guilty of the charges which had been preferred against her. It was true that the proceeding pending elsewhere was not in strictness a judicial proceeding; but it could not be denied that it was an act of one branch of the legislature connected with a most solemn and extraordinary judicial inquiry. Being such, it might also be brought before them, and therefore the House was, as far as regarded it, to all intents and purposes a court of law. Now, if a paragraph had appeared in any publication, reflecting upon the lowest and most subordinate subject in the realm, in the same manner that this shameless paragraph did reflect upon the most exalted subject in it, the lower courts would deem it their duty, supposing that the honour and character of the individual thus assailed were to be on trial before them, to punish the author of such paragraph for wickedly, attempting to bias the minds of the jury, and to destroy the freedom and impartiality of justice. Would, then, that House, acting as the high court of parliament, fail to exercise those judicial duties which its situation entailed upon it, and which every other court would feel itself imperiously called upon to exercise under similar circumstances? Would they allow those insinuations, which would be severely punished if made against the meanest individual in the country whilst
 587
 Mr. Wetherell  said, he was not prepared to take this step; as he had not a copy of the paper in his possession.
 Mr. Tierney  asked the learned member whether he could not lay the paragraph in question upon the table that evening, and give notice for to-morrow.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that nothing could be more painful to a well regulated mind than to observe the extreme length to which the press had gone in discussions on this subject. Instead of presenting the country to the view of foreign nations, as a well organized state, obedient and amenable to the laws, which had been its character in all former times, it had presented it to their view as an angry and disturbed community, most adverse to good order, and remote from
 596 597 598 "This is what a true Commons House would have done; but when that House, for the main part, is composed of venal boroughmongers, grasping placemen, greedy adventurers, and aspiring title-hunters, or the representatives of such worthies,—a body, in short, containing a far greater portion of public criminals than public guardians—what can be expected from it, but just what we have seen it so readily perform?" "We have very little hopes that the Divorce bill will be rejected in such a parliament as the present, because we know, and have seen, that they are sufficiently profligate and servile to act against the clearest testimony of innocence and right.
 599 "The earth has groaned under the curse of monarchical governments much too long. Civilization has struggled against it almost in vain; and Nature herself seemed almost to despair of shaking it off. But the monarchical form of government is like every other vice—it will destroy itself in the course of time, even if no opposition be made to it." 600
 Dr. Lushington  said, that he felt it his duty to state, why he had not come before the House with some specific complaint regarding this atrocious paragraph. The paper in question had been put into his hand some days ago by an hon. friend, who had directed his attention to it—and he had also received information of it from other quarters. On reading it, it excited such indignation in his mind, that he determined to give it his most particular attention. But when he considered that the paper in question was in all probability an obscure country paper, with little or no circulation, and that it would be nothing to repress its malice unless that of a part of the metropolitan press was also checked, it appeared to him to be inconsistent with the dignity of the queen to take any notice of this "Western Luminary." He recollected also, that when his noble friend, the member for Aylesbury, had brought the Morning Post and the Courier before the notice of the House (the first for stating that the queen ought to suffer, it mattered little whether as a criminal or a martyr; and the latter for inserting calumnies against
 601 602 603
 The Attorney General  wished to say a few words, as some misconduct or neglect of duty on his part appeared to be imputed. He thought it a little singular that the hon. and learned mover, should have selected from the numerous libels with which the press had teemed, that which he had brought under the consideration of the House; as it was one so recently published that no opportunity had been given to the law officers of the Crown even to consider whether they should commence proceedings against it. If the hon. and learned gentleman thought this so gross a libel that no time was to be lost in bringing it before the House, he was surprised that the hon. and learned gentleman had overlooked not only the publications from which his noble friend had read extracts, but various other publications, which for the last three or four weeks, had been indulging in the grossest reflections on the conduct both of that and of the other House of Parliament. With respect, however, to the main question before the House, it ought to be recollected, that no  ex officio 604 605 606 607
 Mr. Alderman Wood  presented a petition from Birmingham, complaining of the evils resulting from the state of the representation. The petition reprobated the constitution of parliament. It condemned all attempts made by individuals to possess themselves of boroughs or towns in their own right as acts of treason to the state, and contended that the offenders in the cases alluded to had been inadequately punished in proportion to the enormity of their offence in violating the purity of election. The petition was signed by George Edmonds.
 Mr. R. Smith  rose to compliment the House upon the patience with which it had listened to such a compilation of falsehood and nonsense. He had stopped to hear it read through, although it was so extremely prolix, that he might be in perfect possession of its very extraordinary contents. Now that he was aware of them, he certainly should consider himself extremely culpable if he did not oppose the printing of such trash at a very considerable expense to the public; more particularly as there appeared to be less necessity for any delicacy, as the petition and remonstrance was only signed by an individual, and that individual had not so signed it as the representative of a corporate body.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  had been informed, on receiving the petition, that it contained the sentiments of a numerous meeting of respectable householders at Birmingham, although it had only been signed by their chairman. It was rather strange, he thought, in the hon. member who opposed the printing of the petition, that he should have waited in the House purposely to possess himself of the information or sentiments it contained, and after having enjoyed such a treat he should have the cruelty to deny a similar indulgence to such gentlemen as were absent. He would not withdraw his motion; there were many reasons why he thought he should press it.
 Mr. Gurney  admitted that the petition did not claim any respect from the House as a sensible composition; but he was afraid, in refusing to permit it to be printed, silly as it was, that such a refusal might hereafter be drawn into a precedent on a motion for printing a much more sensible petition. He should therefore prefer that the House should, as it had suffered the petition, after it was aware of its contents, to be laid on the table, suffer it to be printed, as was usual whenever an application of this nature was made, lest the refusal should be drawn into a precedent, to the prejudice of a more serious case.
 Mr. R. Smith  considered it sufficient that the House should be open to receive and listen to the suggestions of collective bodies or individuals, some of whom, as in the present instance, might be justly considered reprehensible as having trifled with the time and patience of the House; but when it was gravely proposed by the worthy alderman to print such offensive nonsense, he felt it a duty imposed on him to oppose it as a public evil, as well as an insult to the House.
 Mr. Lushington  considered the petition had already, in being suffered to lie on the table, received more attention than it merited. It would be an intolerant evil if such trash were permitted to be printed as a matter of course.
 Mr. Alderman Wood  wished to withdraw the motion, as he confessed he had no doubt, from the state of the House, it would be negatived.
 Mr. R. Smith  said, he should not consent to its being withdrawn; it was more advisable that the opinion of the House should be given on the merits of the petition in a more marked way by a decided negative.
 Mr. Maxwell  deprecated the conduct pursued by ministers towards the queen; but however improper that might have been, he could not allow such libels as those that had been lately circulated, to continue to be so circulated any longer with impunity.
 Lord A. Hamilton  denied that when he or the hon. and learned gentleman said any thing in that House, in disparagement of the conduct of ministers towards her majesty, it was with the view of inflaming any one either in or out of doors. What they did was merely to recapitulate that conduct. If such a recapitulation had the effect of inflaming, it was attributable to the conduct itself, and not to him. It appeared to him that the attorney-general had been unfortunate in his illustration res-

 Mr. Tennyson  said, that the Landlords and Tenants' bill, which he had had the honour to introduce, having now received the royal assent, he wished to give notice, before the House separated, that, conformably to an intention which he had before intimated, and to what he found to be a prevalent feeling on the subject, he should, early in the next session, move for leave to bring in a bill for further and more generally amending the laws which affect the relation of landlord and tenant, and especially for providing a more summary and accessible, and a less expensive remedy for recovering the possession, when unlawfully detained, of small tenements held at a rent not exceeding 20 l l
 Mr. Wetherell  replied, that he should first move that it be taken notice of as a
 595
 Mr. Wetherell  wished the whole of the article, of which that paragraph formed a part, to be likewise read, in order that the House might judge better of its malignity from knowing the context.
 Mr. Wetherell  wished that the important subject which he now rose to submit to the House had been placed in abler hands, as it was one that deserved the utmost attention which they could possibly give to it. As the House was already acquainted with the object of his motion, he should commence the observations which he had to make in support of it, by stating that it appeared to him that an individual, whose guilt or innocence was to be ascertained by the passing or the rejection of a bill of pains and penalties, was entitled to the same protection from the high court of parliament, during the investigation of his case, as would be extended to him by the other courts of the country were he to be brought to trial at their bar. Now, he was of opinion, that nobody would dispute, that pending a criminal, or even a civil proceeding in any of the courts of common law, a publication directly or indirectly tending to obstruct that proceeding, was itself, by the common law of England, a criminal offence. He had only to refer to what had occurred within their own recollection, as a proof of this assertion. It happened, however, that the motion which he had to make on this subject had in it this novelty—that no case had as yet occurred, in which, pending an inquiry, on which a bill of pains and penalties, or a bill of attainder, was to be founded, this question had been decided—he meant the question, "whether it was or was not the duty of parliament to take under its protection the person against whom the imputation of guilt was made, and, by so doing, to secure to itself full enjoyment of its own privileges?" Feeling, therefore, as he did, the novelty of the present question, it was not extraordinary that he should entertain some distrust and diffidence regarding the measure to be pursued with the paper which he now held in his hand, and the conductor of which, he was inclined to state, had been guilty of a breach of privilege. Now, when he said this, he felt that it was not for him to recommend the institution of a new precedent, if any doubt existed, regarding its being a breach of privilege. But still he must say, that it was his decided opinion, after giving the matter the best attention, that the paper did contain
 590 in esse 591 sub judice 592 v. 593 ipso facto 594
 Mr. Wetherell  said, that as the noble lord and the hon. and learned gentleman had both intimated that the publication in question would become the subject of prosecution, his object was answered, and he felt great satisfaction that it was so. The House might therefore dispose of his motion as they thought fit. He could not help observing, that the noble lord had not commented on his con-
 609
 Mr. Tierney  declared his determination to reserve his further opinions on the great question respecting her majesty, until it should come regularly before the House. He would therefore confine himself strictly to the motion. He confessed that he could not well understand how his hon. and learned friend could make the libel in question a breach of the privileges of the House. At least, the argument by which his hon. and learned friend had endeavoured to do so, appeared to him to be too refined. Because the House of Commons knew that the House of Lords had entertained a bill which respected her majesty, and because that bill was a parliamentary proceeding, and because the House of Commons was a branch of parliament, therefore the libel in question was a breach of the privileges of the House of Commons. Now, it should be remembered, that what that House knew of the proceedings in the House of Lords, was not by a communication from that House, but merely from an examination of the Lords' Journals. The bill might never come to the House of Commons. If the publication in question was really a breach of privilege, it ought to be taken notice of by the House of Lords rather than by the House of Commons. The next question was, whether, if it was declared to be a breach of privilege, the attorney-general should be instructed to prosecute Now, to such a proceeding, he conceived there were many objections. It was odious to send a man to trial with the weight of the opinion of the House of Commons against him. But even if prosecution by the attorney-general were the fit course, it was for the House of Lords to pursue it, and not the House of Commons. Under all the circumstances of the case, he strongly recommended to his hon. and learned friend to withdraw his motion.
 The Speaker  then asked Mr. Wetherell, whether he meant to complain of the paper as guilty of a breach of privilege, or to move that the attorney-general be directed to prosecute the editor of it for the passage reflecting on the queen?
 Sir M. Cholmeley  seconded the motion. He said, that the slanders which were disseminated by means of the licentious press of the country were certainly such as went to deprive the two Houses of any thing like freedom of judgment. If the press were to form the judgment of the country on this important question, it might happen that the judgment of the two Houses of Parliament might not be satisfactory to it, and in that case the most dreadful consequences might be anticipated. He therefore gladly seconded this motion, and trusted that the effect of it would be not only to deter the editor of the paper complained of from pursuing a similar conduct, but to put down the efforts of the licentious press throughout the country.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose to move that the House at its rising should adjourn to that day four weeks. His object in moving such an adjournment was, that the House should be enabled to provide for the proper course, in whatever state the proceedings of the Bill before the House of Lords might be at the time. So that in the event of any interruption to the proceeding, by giving time to her majesty to call evidence from abroad, an ulterior adjournment might then take place, or that time might be given for the fullest attendance by a call of the House.
 Lord Francis Osborne  said, his objections to the bill now in progress
 826
 Mr. Hobhouse  rose to second the amendment. He had that day come down to the House under the full impression of moving a similar amendment to that proposed by the noble lord, if no member more competent to the task undertook that duty. He was most anxious to take the first opportunity of entering his protest against that monstrous measure of iniquity which was now in progress in another place, to the disgrace of the House of Lords, and the degradation of the monarchy. If he had no other objection to the measure, the preparations he had witnessed that day—preparations got up by the ministers for the purpose of hedging themselves in their alarming course—would alone have compelled him to call upon them to desist. Never, he believed, had this country witnessed such a sight as had been presented to him that evening on coming down to perform his duty as an English member of parliament; never since the days of Oliver Cromwell had a similar spectacle been exhibited. What was the world to think of a measure that could not even be generated without an assemblage of military guards; and that could not be carried on without filling with troops every apartment in the neighbourhood of parliament, and every avenue leading to either House? Indeed
 827
 Mr. Western  expressed his decided aversion to the erection of that House into a court of justice. In every view of the subject, such a course was attended with difficulty and danger. He assured the House, that from one end of the country to the other, there could not be found an impartial person who did not regret the prosecution that was now going on. Not an individual could be met who did not regret, nay even condemn, the erasure of her majesty's name from the Liturgy. He never yet heard a single ground on which that fatal act could be defended. The people were loud in the expression of their abhorrence
 828
 Lord Castlereagh  was of opinion that nothing ought to drag the House, under the present circumstances, into any thing like a discussion of the great question at issue. On a subject so extensive, so important in all its bearings, and requiring so much calmness and time, the House ought not to be forced into an immediate deliberation. He was not aware of any existing circumstance which should lead the House to depart from the course they thought best at the period of their last se-
 830 831 832
 Lord A. Hamilton  in explanation, stated, that what he had said was, that being bound to vote on the present occasion, he, after deliberating on the difficulties which pressed on both sides of the question, would give his reluctant vote for the amendment. The noble lord had talked of him as being the friend of the Queen. He wished to be understood as the friend of the country, and in that capacity he was anxious to put a stop to the present proceedings.
 Lord A. Hamilton  observed, that he felt as fully as any member the unfortunate predicament in which the House was placed. He felt as fully as his right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney) the conflicting difficulties and dangers that on every side surrounded the question, but he also was convinced that these difficulties and dangers were much more likely to be increased by a continuance of the present course, than by at once putting a termination to it. It was with that conviction that he should give his support to the amendment. To justify his own consistency hereafter, he took that opportunity of declaring, that whenever or in whatever shape the proceeding came before them, his vote should never be regulated by the consideration of the guilt or innocence of the accused. He felt, then, as he from the first moment declared, that his insuperable objection to the prosecution of the Queen, whose life, not for the last six, but for 26 years, has been a life of unparalleled persecution, arose from his full conviction of her being precluded from the possibility of having justice extended to her, on the consideration of her guilt or innocence. In considering the guilt or innocence of that unhappy woman, there must be taken into consideration so many shades, such a variety of discriminations, such palliations, that he ever must contend, that those who originated the prosecution, were disqualified by their very own acts towards her, from proceeding against her. When he reflected on the manner in which she was forsaken, abandoned, and insulted at home—persecuted and vilified abroad—he felt he should not be acting with justice towards her, if he did not protest against a trial, instituted under such circumstances, and conducted by such accusers. That was not the proper time to cast imputations on his majesty's ministers: but he could not help saying to them, that they could with a very ill grace, accuse others of inconsistency, who had themselves given such frequent proofs of
 829
 Lord A. Hamilton  observed, that what he had said was, that the hon. member's motion had that effect—not that the hon. member had that intention.
 Mr. Tierney  could not agree to the amendment recommending a prorogation of Parliament, after the proceedings that had already taken place in the Lords. It would be most unjust to her majesty, after what had passed, to stop short, and deprive her of the means of defence. When he said that, he begged it to be understood, as not lending himself in any degree in support of the form of proceeding. To that, no man could feel a stronger objection than himself. In acceding to the motion of adjournment, he felt he was giving no pledge to the course he should pursue, whether to receive the bill, or to suggest another mode, or that he was surrendering an iota of the privileges of that House.
 Mr. Tierney  said, if he understood the noble lord, the arrangement was, that nothing should take place at the period when the proposed adjournment should end, but to fix a convenient period for a call of the House.
 Mr. Brougham  observed, that perhaps this was a question on which he ought not to say any thing, but, with the permission of the House, he begged to offer a few words. No man who had attended to the course of the proceedings in that House would accuse him of having shown any anxiety to press this subject on, or any disinclination to allow of any interval which might afford a chance of doing justice, without any further parliamentary investigation to the high parties implicated. On the contrary, from the moment the message from the Crown was presented to the House, he had intreated parliament to pause before it was too late.
 836 837
 Mr. Wilberforce  would not have troubled the House with any observations on the present occasion, had it not been for what had fallen from a noble lord, who had alluded to the motion which he (Mr. Wilberforce) had some time ago made on the subject of her majesty, but which had not experienced the success that he expected. But for that he should have contented himself with silently acquiescing in the motion for the adjournment, it being distinctly understood, that in doing so, no hon. member pledged himself to any opinion on the bill of pains and penalties, if it should come down to that House. The noble lord had stated in that House what would he studiously and industriously repeated elsewhere; that he (Mr. W.) had been anxious in making the motion to which he had alluded, to fortify ministers. He declared, from the bottom of his soul, that nothing could be more sincere than his desire on that occasion to put an end to the necessity of any further proceeding. He had no intention to fortify ministers.
 Mr. Wilberforce  said, that when a proposition such as that which the noble lord had advanced, was accompanied with a guard, the proposition generally appeared elsewhere, but without the guard. That was generally dropt. It would, in all probability, be stated elsewhere, that the noble lord had said, not that such was the effect, but that such had been the object of his motion. He had frequently been subjected to the most detestable calumny so originating. He was obliged to the noble lord, however, for the explanation. As to the amendment proposed by the noble lord on that occasion, to address the King to restore her majesty's name to the Liturgy, he had not made such a proposition to the House, because he knew he

 Mr. Keith Douglas  said, in explanation, that the hon. gentleman must have entirely mistaken what he had said. He had never complained of the proper expression of the public feelings, nor of the constitutional exercise of the liberty of the press—he had merely said, that he thought the press was now exercised in an undue manner, and for a purpose which seemed as if it was intended to intimidate parliament and the country from adopting any measure which partook of a particular character. To attempt such intimidation, pending the agitation of a great public question, was, he thought highly unconstitutional. For his own part, he thought it right, as a member of parliament, to say, that no undue influence should deter him from the strict discharge of his public duty. With respect to the mode of presenting the addresses to which he alluded, he meant merely to say, that it was very unusual to assemble the people in such numbers to go up in bodies with addresses. The appearance of such crowds was certainly alarming.
 Mr. Huskinson  rose, to give some explanation respecting that part of the hon. gentleman's speech in which he stated that the person who was lately the editor of the Courier had received a present of
 104
 Lord Castlereagh  thought it not quite regular, upon the prevalence of such rumours as those to which the hon. gentleman alluded, to put formal questions to his majesty's ministers. To encourage such questions would, he thought, tend more to perplex the business of the country, than to assist its course. It was most unreasonable to ask him to pronounce any opinion upon transactions respecting which he had at present hardly any information. He trusted the hon. gentleman would deem this n sufficient answer, in the absence of any official information upon the subject.
 Mr. Brogden  brought up the Report of the Committee appointed to inspect the Lords Journals, with relation to the present state of any proceedings had respecting the Bill of Pains and Penalties against her Majesty. The report having been read,
 Mr. Hume  asked, whether the noble lord had received any communication as to the probable extent of the defence for the Queen, or what time it was likely to occupy? Because, if the noble lord had had no such information, he might be proposing to assemble the House to no purpose, but merely that of a further adjournment.
 Lord Castlereagh  observed, that he wished the House to be left open for the exercise of its own discretion as to the period of any farther adjournment. If the bill of Pains and Penalties should be brought down from the other House, it was his present intention to move a further adjournment to the 5th or 10th of November, and that the House should be then called over.
 Mr. Hume  repeated, that the more distant period would be the more advisable, because it would be more certain.
 Lord Castlereagh  still thought a previous meeting advisable to fix the precise time of taking the discussion which they could on the 17th better determine than now. This was a proceeding of too much delicacy to be left standing over; they ought, therefore, to watch its progress, and then determine, should the bill come before them, the earliest possible time when they could devote themselves to it.
 Sir Gerard Noel  could not think what the noble lord meant when he talked of delicacy in this business. Surely he did not mean to say that his majesty's ministers had treated the House with delicacy. On the contrary they had treated the House' just as a huntsman did a pack of hounds—they turned them out, and whipped them in, just as they wanted them.
 Lord Francis Osborne  begged for some explanation from the noble lord opposite
 107
 Lord Castlereagh  regretted his inability to enter into the legal construction of the statute of Edward with the noble lord, but he thought it obvious that the bill, as at present framed, had two purposes—the one affecting her majesty's rights as Queen and the other enacting a divorce. What he understood his noble friend (the earl of Liverpool) to have stated elsewhere was this—that there was no intention whatever of acting in opposition to any religious feeling which might be excited; and that the part of the bill which went to the divorce need not be pressed, as the measure was disclaimed for the purpose of affording any personal remedy. Upon public and not upon personal grounds its
 108
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow  observed, that, after all that had passed upon this subject, after the strong expressions used in debate regarding the nature of the pending proceeding, and the opinions so industriously circulated in all quarters, it was fit, for the honour and character of the House, as well as for the satisfaction of the country, that the inquiry should be conducted with the utmost possible solemnity. He submitted, therefore, whether it might not be expedient that a bill should be brought in, to enable the House of Commons to examine witnesses upon oath. He did not himself feel authorized to propose such a bill: a man so private and unknown as he was, could scarcely hope to have influence enough to carry it through; but he trusted that the executive government would take the subject into consideration.
 Mr. Creevey  said, he was in doubt whether he rightly understood the hon. and learned gentleman. Within the last few days, reports had been circulated of an intended motion, on the part of persons who were to be looked upon as the prosecutors of the Queen, to induce the House to renounce the right it now enjoyed, and had always possessed since it had been a House of Commons, of examining witnesses at the bar. He was not sure, therefore, whether what the hon. and learned gentleman had proposed was not intended to sound the country on the subject, and whether the suggestion had not been made with the privity of ministers. [Mr. Serjeant Onslow said, across the floor, "On my honour, no."] He did not say that such was the design of the hon. and learned gentleman, but it might have that effect. If such a rumour were true, and if, after having degraded the King, the Queen, and the other House of Parliament, ministers proceeded to deprive the House of Commons of its undoubted and most valuable privilege of
 52
 Mr. Serjeant Onslow , in explanation, said, that he had been misapprehended. He perfectly agreed with the hon. gentleman, that were the House to forego its privilege of examining witnesses at the bar, in such a case as that in question, it would degrade itself for ever. He declared upon his honour, that he had never had any communication with his majesty's ministers, or with any other person, on the subject of the proposition, which he had ventured to suggest to the House, and which proposition, so far from being any abandonment of the privileges of the House, as to the examination of witnesses, was to enable the House to examine witnesses on oath.
 Mr. Bernal , in the present stage of the proceedings, protested against any extension of the jurisdiction of the House of Commons. It would be to him a subject of the most solemn regret to see the power of examining witnesses on oath assumed by that House. Nothing could be more dangerous to the liberty of the subject, than to invest that House with any such inquisitorial authority. If such a proposition should actually be made, he did hope, therefore, that the hon. and learned member would, on consideration, vote against its reception, on the ground of its tyrannical and dangerous character.
 Mr. Hobhouse  said, he would not be deterred by the reflection that the subject might have fallen into abler hands, from saying a few words upon it. When he considered the fresh and increasing difficulties in which the House and the country were involved, he certainly had looked round with a hope that some hon. gentleman of more importance than himself,
 53 in limine 54
 The Speaker  interposed, and called the hon. gentleman to order. Some allusion, in such a case as the present, might, perhaps, be allowable, to what might have occurred in the other House of Parliament; but he put it to the good sense of the honourable gentleman, whether to enter into such details, as to the divisions which had taken place there, was not an infringement, not merely of the form, but of the substance of the rules of the House of Commons?
 Mr. Hobhouse  disclaimed any wish to violate the rules of parliament. He had thought himself justified in making the allusions which he had done on the present occasion. He meant to refer merely to what was perfectly notorious.
 Mr. Calcraft  conceived, that if the hon. gentleman confined himself to a statement of the divisions he would be in order, as the House of Commons, having access to the Journals of the House of Lords, had a right to be informed on that subject.
 Mr. Hobhouse  proceeded. He had considered himself justified in alluding to what was not only notorious, but to what in fact had become matter of record in a
 55 in limine? 56 57 58
 Sir Robert Wilson  rose. He said, that the silence of ministers on the present occasion might be very dignified, but it would not satisfy the country. For himself, he would not forego the present opportunity of declaring, that should the bill of Pains and Penalties come into that House, there was no resistance—no obstacle—no impediment—which the wit of man could devise, or perseverance apply, that he would not make use of to stop its progress; not merely because the measure in its form was abominable, odious, and unconstitutional, but because he now conceived himself a competent judge of the merits of the whole proceeding. He had attended every day in the House of Lords—he had heard all the witnesses—he had listened to all that could be urged in their favour—he had observed the conduct of the judicial assembly, and he was prepared to assert on his oath—on his conscience before God—that these proceedings had originated in a foul and infamous conspiracy. These were hard terms, it was true; but it was his duty, on an occasion like this, to speak out, and not to allow the best interests of his country to suffer, lest he should give offence in any quarter. He could adduce proof, that the conspiracy originated, not at Milan, but at Hanover. Could any man doubt that when it was found that baron Ompteda, after having executed the instructions which he had received, to pick-locks, to forge keys, and to steal letters, and after
 59 l l l 60
 Dr. Phillimore  had long ago made up his mind not to say a single word on the merits of the subject, until the bill should come regularly before the House. What he now rose for, therefore, was, merely to make a few collateral and explanatory observations. The gallant general, and the honourable gentleman who preceded him, had violated the distinct understanding which existed on the subject, by entering into an  ex-parte ex-parte 61
 Mr. Bennet  said, he was desirous of an opportunity of stating, that his original opinion was in no respect changed by what had recently transpired in the House of Lords. All men, he thought, must now feel, that day after day new and increasing dangers were impending over the country by a perseverance in this measure, and that there was no safety but in retreat. For years ministers had pursued the same system of bringing into odium and contempt the institutions of the country. Their last effort was the bill now before parliament, and its introduction would be regretted, by all who loved their country, to the latest hour of their existence. Whether the bill should pass or not, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the Sovereign, all would be degraded. He had heard the prime minister state in the other House of Parliament, that if it were wished by religious persons, the divorce clause in the bill would be abandoned. That would be to degrade both the parties. It would be to state, that although her majesty's conduct had been too infamous to justify her continuance in that rank, it had not been too infamous to justify her remaining the wife of the King of England [Hear, hear!]. The hon. and learned gentleman, who had just sat down, had said, that his gallant friend's statement was an  ex-parte ex-parte 62 63 64
 The Attorney General , notwithstanding the tone and temper which had distinguished the speeches of those hon. gentlemen on the other side who had addressed the House on this occasion, should not be tempted to follow the course which they had taken. For what did they do? They were aware that they were now discussing a proceeding which was pending in the other House; yet they came down to the House, and gave their opinions upon that proceeding, and endeavoured—(he must be permitted to say, at least, that such was calculated to be the effect of their speeches)—by statements of what had, and not only of what had, but of what had not passed in the other House, to inflame the minds of the people upon the subject. He, for one, would not follow the example which the honourable gentlemen had set; but he might be allowed to say a word or two respecting certain expressions which had fallen from an honourable member opposite, as directed against him, and as reflecting on the manner in which he, as attorney-general, had opened the case, and produced evidence to support it. It had been said that the course and conduct pursued by him had been disgraceful, Whatever hon. gentlemen might please to say, he should content himself with replying, that it would have been disgraceful in him if he had shrunk from that line of conduct which he had pursued. It would be seen hereafter whether the proceedings which had been taken against the Queen were or were not justified; but he could assure the House, that, in their present stage, he should consider himself infinitely more disgraced if the approbation of the honourable member had been bestowed on his conduct.
 Mr. Hume  said, it had not been his intention to trouble the House on the present occasion, but feeling strongly on the question, he hoped he might be allowed to make some observations after what had been said. An honourable and learned gentleman had thought fit to complain of the conduct of the gallant officer, for bringing the subject before the House in the way he had done. He would ask, for what was the House now assembled? What was the purpose for which they had met? What was the object of the right honourable the chancellor of the exchequer's motion now before the House? The object and the purpose were known to every person, both in and out of parliament. Was his gallant friend to be blamed for speaking
 66 ex-parte ex-parte ex parte ex-parte 67 68 ex-parte 69 70 71 72 73 74
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that after the turn which the debate had taken, he should not find it necessary to trouble the House with many words. But there were some situations in which discussions were brought forward upon grounds so little reasonable, and arguments adduced so foreign to the business properly before the House, and which, in his own mind, he might feel, could never have any influence in it, that he found it impossible not to offer some observations, however repugnant to his feelings it might be to be thus dragged into a debate of this kind. He was quite sure that the good sense of the House must be disgusted at finding that they were now occupied upon a debate on a proceeding still pending in the other House; that the character of that House, and with it every thing connected with one of the most important measures ever agitated there, were thus unnecessarily dragged into a discussion; and that, in the judicial spirit in which an hon. member on the other side of the House had spoken, his impartiality and his penetration appeared to be summed up in this charge—that one of her majesty's counsel had been shamefully browbeaten by the House of Lords! This might furnish the House, he thought, with a true measure of the temper in which all the other observations they had heard had been made. So far from having any effect, indeed, with hon. gentlemen, or any way degrading the illustrious assembly in question, they could only serve to show that there were persons in the country of minds and views so perverted as to prompt them to attack the high character of an assembly which their attack could not reach. He had been very much surprised to hear the hon. member for Westminster assume (which he had no right to assume), that that House had already decided that it would not make any inquiry into the subject before them. That was a point which had never been decided. He (lord Castlereagh) certainly had proposed to bring the question to an issue; but hon. gentlemen would remember the steps which it had been at length agreed to take. Fore-

 Mr. Maberly  said, he should not assert that the whole of the proceedings against the Queen originated in a foul conspiracy; nor did he rise to insult the nice honour of the attorney-general by making any comments on the speeches of the counsel; but he felt himself called upon to give the reasons why he supported the motion of the honourable member for Westminster. He had formerly had the pleasure (and he could sincerely say it was a pleasure) to vote with the noble lord Castlereagh, in the majority which declared, on the 22nd of June last, that the proceedings against the Queen, whatever the result of them might be, could not be otherwise than derogatory from the honour of the Crown, and injurious to the best interests of the country. He, therefore, now, in accordance with that resolution, and for the sake of maintaining his own consistency in what he conceived to be a correct opinion, should vote for the motion of the hon. member for Westminster. The noble lord had talked of the fear of public clamour, and had dealt out his monitions to that side of the House, in a very general and unwarrantable way. The noble lord should have confined his admonitions to those who needed them. He meant to do his duty, as fearlessly and as regardlessly of public clamour, as the noble lord; he would perform his duty to his constituents as honestly as the noble lord; but there necessarily was, in the judgment of every man, a public feeling that should have some weight with parliament, and it was manifest to every one that that opinion was now decidedly against the proceedings in the case of the Queen, and it was equally clear, that it was, in a great measure, founded on that vote in which he had concurred, and which he now wished the House to maintain. He had thus stated his reasons for the vote which he should give; he should have been able to avoid that necessity,
 82
 Mr. Creevey  said, that he also should state why he agreed with the honourable member for Westminster, in the amendment which he had moved. He could not agree that the proceedings which were now carrying on in the other House did not form a fit subject for discussion at that moment. He had known no public question that had ever arisen, of greater importance than whether the bill pending against her majesty should be allowed to proceed? and he knew no other mode of bringing that question into discussion, and getting an opinion on it than by such, a motion as that of the honourable member for Westminster. On a former occasion, when the noble lord, the member for Cambridgeshire had made a similar proposition, he had determined to support it; but the counsel for the Queen had said, that it would be a great hardship if she were not allowed to go into her defence, and he had consequently withdrawn his support from that motion. But the fact was, as it now appeared, that though the whole of the case against the Queen was gone through, the injuries she had suffered were so great, that the evidence against her went, in the opinion of the public, for nothing. The people had seen the Queen charged With a crime that was no crime by law; menaced with an act which was at once to make the
 83 84 85
 Mr. Peter Moore  said, he should state his reasons for supporting the amendment, as well on account of the importance of the subject, as because, from his having attended a great number of public meetings, he had a better opportunity than many members of knowing what the public opinion was. He now lamented, that the motion of the noble lord the member for Cambridgeshire (lord F. Osborne) on a former occasion, had not been carried into effect. The objection that was then made to the motion was, that as the evidence had begun, it was fit it should be carried through. He had not thought that argument conclusive, and he should vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Westminster on the present occasion; and in doing so, he should be acting in unison with his constituents, who had had a meeting on the subject, and had instructed him to resist ever step of this inquiry. The noble lord's objection appeared the least of all objections on the subject. The noble lord had contended, that public justice required that an inquiry of this nefarious character (for it was nefarious) should be further continued. But a day of reckoning would come, and it was not far distant. He had given the subject every possible consideration—he had looked at every pretence on which it had been brought forward—he had weighed all the evidence and his solemn conviction was, that this was as dark and foul a conspiracy as had ever been formed, and that his majesty's ministers were at the bottom of it. He would not mince it. He repeated, that it was as foul a conspiracy as had ever been formed, and that his majesty's ministers were at the bottom of it. He had reflected on the state of the public mind; and there was but one opinion as to the necessity of rescuing the
 86 87 88
 Mr. Ellice  said, he was under the necessity of differing from his honourable colleague on the subject of the proposed amendment. If he could think it consistent with any principle of justice, or if he could persuade himself that it would have the effect of limiting the calamitous consequences which every day became more apparent, he should readily sacrifice his own opinion to that of his honourable friend. But as he did not think it likely that the amendment would be carried, he must frankly say, that he saw no reason to concur with it. The evidence against the illustrious person in question had gone forth to the public, accompanied by the statement, summing up, and comments of the law-officers of the Crown. To him it appeared that it would be gross injustice not to allow her majesty the opportunity of rebutting it, and of proving what had been asserted, that the charges were the offspring of a foul conspiracy. Upon these grounds, he felt obliged to vote against the proposition for now putting an end to the inquiry, although it would give him extreme satisfaction to support any motion that could stop the further proceedings, if that measure was not at the same time an act of injustice towards the illustrious person accused. He would also state his determination, if the bill should unfortunately come down to that House, to oppose the first reading of it, on the principle, that bills of such a description ought never to be entertained, except in cases where the were essential to the public safety.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  expressed his concurrence in the views stated by his honourable friend who had just set down; but he rose for the purpose of putting a question to his majesty's ministers, which in his opinion was of importance both to the character and dignity of the government. He had observed in a report of what had passed at a recent meeting held at the Crown and Anchor, that an honourable baronet (sir G. Noel), who presided on that occasion, had read a letter from a worthy alderman (Wood), in which it was said that the defence of the Queen had been left short by the want of pecu-
 89
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, he was perfectly prepared to give the honourable baronet a distinct official answer to the question which he had put. He could assure him, in the first place, that every sum for which application had been made by the Queen's legal advisers had been advanced, with an intimation from the Treasury, that if any further sums were deemed necessary they would be cheerfully furnished, subject only to such an account as the legal advisers of the Queen should be able to render.
 Sir M. W. Ridley  asked, what was the actual sum advanced on account of the defence?
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  replied, that the whole amount of what had been advanced was 20,000 l l
 Mr. Hume  wished to know how many days had elapsed between the application for the second sum, and its actual advance?
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  said, that no further time had elapsed than was strictly in accordance with the forms of office.
 Mr. S. C. Whitbread  wished to state, in a very few words, the reasons which induced him to support a motion which had for its object an immediate abandonment of the proceedings against her majesty. In his opinion, the calamitous consequences which they had a tendency to produce, and were really producing, became more obvious every day. He had never indeed been able to discover what beneficial end was to be answered by them. It was said, that the subject had been taken up out of a regard to public morals; but who would say that public morals would not have been more respected by a suppression of the inquiry,
 90
 Mr. Lennard  felt it his duty to protest against the doctrine of the noble lord that it was improper for this House to interfere with the proceedings of the House of Lords. He was surprised to hear such an opinion expressed by any member of the House of Commons. If there was one right better established than another, it was the right, he should rather call it the duty, of the House of Commons to check and to control the House of Lords, when it was assuming to itself any dangerous or unconstitutional power. This was a right repeatedly exercised by this House. In the time of Charles the Second, when the House of Lords attempted to exercise, in the case of Skinner against the East India Company, * * 91
 Sir Gerard Noel  declared that he could not reconcile it to his feelings to give quite a silent vote upon this question. He believed that the bill under consideration was altogether without a precedent since the period of the Revolution. The House of Lords had never since that period assumed the kind of jurisdiction which they were now exercising. He had heard with much pleasure the sentiments expressed by many honourable members, and was confirmed in his resolution of opposing the bill in all its stages.
 Mr. Alderman Heygate  said, he was originally of the opinion expressed in the resolution of the House of the 22nd of June last, that the discussion of this affair of the Queen must, in any result, be injurious to the best interests of all the parties. Every thing had since concurred to strengthen this opinion, and to show the impolicy of suspending the business of a great country, on account of the conduct of an individual, and a subject, however exalted in rank. It would not, however, now be fair to stop the proceedings until both sides had been heard in the House of Peers. When that had taken place would be the proper time to pause and consider what course it was best to pursue. In the mean time the honourable alderman deprecated the unconstitutional language used on behalf of the Queen, to induce the army to interfere in political questions—language which, in former times, would have called forth the notice of all who valued the constitution. He called upon every one professing to love freedom to pause before be used, or countenanced even by his
 92
 Mr. Keith Douglas  observed, that the consternation and dismay which had been represented as now prevailing were, in in his opinion, to be ascribed rather to the influence of the press than to the extent of our military establishments. He took a view of our danger somewhat different from that entertained by the worthy alderman who preceded him. Every one who wished well to the prosperity of the country must lament to see the public press so mischievously, so ably, and so successfully labouring, in a way that was not adequately resisted, to inflame discontent, and to increase public alarm. He thought it would be improper for parliament to separate without an understanding that his majesty's ministers had some measures in contemplation for correcting the licence of the press [A loud cry of "Hear hear!" from the Opposition benches]. He might be imperfectly expressing what he meant, but he did see in the evil of which he complained a danger truly alarming. It was far from his wish that the liberties of the country should be curtailed; but the question was, whether some remedy ought not to be applied to a great evil? The case of the Queen was one subject of consideration; but it was brought into connexion with various others, by the journals and publications of the day. The press had assumed a new character; it was conducted with unusual ability, and was incessantly employed in propagating its doctrines. The consequences were evident; they found addresses presented of a new description, coming from large bodies not before accustomed to assemble together for such a purpose. As an instance, he might refer to the address lately carried up to the Queen by a great
 93
 Mr. Bernal  wished to make only three remarks. Did the hon. gentleman who spoke last consider that his majesty's ministers had not duly exercised the power entrusted to them, or did he wish them to produce a new edition of the late acts for regulating the press? If there was any danger in what was now going forward, the House of Lords had not shown any apprehension of it; the had imposed no restriction on the publication of the entire proceedings, and had suffered evidence to go forth to the world, which must necessarily have the effect of casting a slur upon the Queen's character. That House would do well to cherish the liberty of the press, and not allow it to be cut down in a by-way. If it was conducted with superior industry and talent, that was an additional reason for pardoning its occasional licence.
 Mr. Hobhouse  observed, that although as a young member he felt diffident in pressing the House to a division, yet the question appeared to him to be so important, that he was placed under the necessity of exercising his right.
 Sir Robert Wilson , seeing the noble lord opposite in his place, was extremely anxious to ask him a question of some importance, to which he hoped the noble lord would have no objection to return an answer. In doing this, it was necessary for him to state to the noble lord, that a man of the name of Krous had been employed by the Milan commission, as an extra courier (not as the courier of the government), and had, in that capacity, been frequently sent from Milan, on different matters connected with the business of the commission. In proceeding to England, it was understood that this person was arrested in Paris, on the charge of having forged Bank of England notes in his possession to the amount of 310 l
 Lord Castlereagh  said, though he was not able to answer the gallant general's question to its fullest extent, he was happy in having an opportunity of stating what he knew of this business—a statement which he conceived to be due to the individual mentioned. Under the circumstances of the case, his answer
 95
 Mr. Whitbread  rose, in conformity with the notice he had given in the early part of the evening, to move, that an account of the sums expended in the prosecution of the Queen be laid on the table, from the earliest period of the six years, when the proceedings were first instituted, down to the present time. At any other period he would have given the notice usual on such occasions; but the peculiar circumstances under which the House had assembled prevented him from adopting that course. Besides, he conceived that not the least opposition could be made to the motion. He was induced to call for this account, in consequence of many reports that had gone abroad, as well as of many statements which had come out in the course of the evidence (with all of which they were acquainted), from which it appeared that some of the witnesses ac-
 96
 Lord Castlereagh  said, if the hon. gentleman had intimated to the House that he merely wished for a statement of the general amount of the public expenditure connected with this matter, although he (lord C.) might consider it not prudent to call for such an account, still he felt that it was one which might have been granted; but certainly, the motion, as it now stood, was extremely unsatisfactory, because the hon. member had not called on the House for a short statement of the expenses incurred by the whole of the proceedings, both those that were necessary in supporting the bill, and those that were called for in opposing it. The hon. gentleman had called for a detailed account, on one aide, for the purpose of examining adversely, and criminally, if he pleased, any part of that expenditure which he thought proper. Now, to whatever point the House might hereafter deem it necessary to extend its inquiries, he thought that the present was not a moment for the introduction of an exami-
 97
 Mr. Whitbread  said, he had stated that he was induced to make this motion in J consequence of an account that had been applied for in another House, relative to the expenses incurred on the part of the Queen, which they all knew must be a mere trifle when compared with the sum expended in support of the bill. If this were not a proper and convenient time to ask for an account of the sums issued in supporting the bill, he could not imagine how it could be a proper and convenient time for granting an account of the expense incurred in defending the Queen.
 Lord Castlercagh  said, he had no objection to laying the gross amount of the expenditure on the table of the House; but he believed it was not the intention of the hon. member to enter into the question of the general expenditure, but, as he understood him, to examine the expenditure in detail, and to object to some part of it. He would not press the previous question, but move for an account of the gross expenditure, as far as the same can be made up.
 Mr. Bennet  wished to ask the noble lord from what fund these sums of money had been drawn. The noble lord had said, on a former occasion, that the duke of Cornwall had a right to inquire into the conduct of his wife. Now, if he had a right to inquire into the conduct of the duchess of Cornwall, he (Mr. B.) conceived he had also a right to pay the expenses. He hoped the right hon. gentleman, or the noble lord would inform the House from what fund, whether large or small, the expenses of this inquiry were to be paid?
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that the expenses which had been incurred abroad were properly charged out of the secret-service money; but from the moment the investigation assumed the character of a public inquiry, it would be charged among the civil contingencies. His majesty's ministers were prepared to submit all the items charged out of the secret-service money to the same audit as every other part of the expenditure.
 Mr. Hume  said, it was fresh in his recollection, when the vote for secret-service money was last before that House, that he put a question to the noble lord, having at that time in his mind the expenditure of the Milan commission. He had stated the great amount of the vote demanded, and the answer he had received, to the best of his remembrance, was this—the noble lord had said that the House must be aware that, during a long war, expenses would be incurred, chargeable on the secret-service money, which would not end at the termination of hostilities, but must be provided for during some time after. From this answer, he did not think that any part of the secret service money could be intended for the Milan commission; because the question was expressly put, in order to ascertain whether it was possible for his majesty's government, consistently with their oath, to take sums out of that fund for such a service? Now, however, to his utter astonishment, he found that they did make use of apart of that money, notwithstanding their oath, to effect this dirty purpose.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, if he recollected rightly, the hon. member had asked him a question as to the gross amount of such secret-service money for the year. He had observed, "Why, as you are now at peace, is there a necessity to call on parliament for so large a sum on account of secret services?" and he (lord C.)

 Mr. Maberly  said, he was desirous to know, as the noble lord had stated that one part of the proceeding was to be defrayed out of the secret-service money, from what fund his majesty's ministers intended to pay the residue of the expense? There had been no grant made by parliament, and be knew not from what fund he could take that money.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that after the period had elapsed when the expenses had ceased to be defrayed from the secret-service money, bills had been drawn by the commission abroad, and answered by the foreign office. They would of course be sanctioned by the Treasury.
 Mr. Maberly  replied, that this was a most dangerous mode of proceeding, and contrary to the usage of that House. If ministers had a right to take 1,000 l l
 Mr. Huskisson  observed, that the proceeding in this case was of the same nature as what took place with respect to the army extraordinancs. They consisted of items which had not been foreseen, and could not therefore be made matter of estimate in the first instance. The mode pursued was, to take a vote for a certain sum; and, in the next session of parlia-

 Mr. Creevey  said, there was a difference between the explanation by the noble lord and that which had been offered by the right hon. gentleman. The former had pointed to the secret-service money as the fund from whence the expenses were to be defrayed; while, the latter spoke of the civil contingencies. Be that, however, as it might, it was clear that, if the money were to be granted out of any public fund, ministers ought to come with some proposition to parliament on the subject. He was sure that the noble lord's construction of the act by which the secret-service money was regulated was not correct. If it were, if ministers could take such sums of money as those that had been mentioned, from that fund, under the plea that this proceeding came within the meaning of secret service, the most dangerous consequences might follow. If, when his majesty chose to follow his wife abroad, and to make efforts to procure evidence against her, such a proceeding, could be supposed to come under the act, as one, the expenses of which should be defrayed out of the secret-service money, it was time that the act should be revised, and that some means should be devised by parliament to prevent such an abuse of that fund. With respect to his hon. friend's motion, of course, he would only be able to procure the gross amount of the expenditure. But here he might be allowed to observe that, if the bill did not come to this House, it would then be a mere private business; there would be no claim whatever on that House to make good the expense. What then would ministers do? The only course left them would be, to apply to the king's private purse—a course which, he believed, they would not very readily pursue.
 Mr. Bennet  wished to know, at what precise period the noble lord deemed the proceeding to be one to which secret-service money was no longer applicable.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, the proceeding became of a public nature from the time the message was sent down to both Houses of Parliament. The sums taken from the fund for secret service would be laid before parliament in the same manner as the expenses incurred for the defence of her majesty.
 Mr. Hume  wished to know whether the Milan commission had acted from the outset under the sanction and with the approbation of his majesty's government?
 Lord Castlereagh  said, it had the full knowledge and approbation of his majesty's ministers from the beginning. It was adopted in order to prepare for carrying on the proceeding in its present form, if the charges were gravely supported; and, on the other hand to set the matter at rest if they were found to rest on no solid foundation.
 Sir Gerard Noel  said, his decided opinion was, that the House would act criminally, if it consented to burthen the public with one shilling of the expense.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he was ready to agree to a motion for an account of the expenses incurred on both sides in the proceeding now pending against the Queen, as far as the same could be made out.
 Mr. Whitbread  accordingly withdrew his motion, and the motion suggested by lord Castlereagh was put and agreed to.
 Mr. Hume  rose, to present a petition from the burgh of Montrose deprecating the proceedings that were now in progress against her majesty. He could not avoid expressing his surprise at the observations of an hon. gentleman (Mr. K. Douglas), who, in the course of his speech, had called on his majesty's ministers to devise some means by which the liberty of the press might be checked, and by which the demonstration of public feeling, manifested at different meetings convened for the purpose of addressing her majesty, might be prevented. The respectable body whose petition he held in his hand, had met, and had addressed her majesty; and honourable members had not, he conceived, any right to condemn them or others for pursuing that line of conduct. In his opinion, those who assembled on such an occasion, to express their feelings, deserved praise instead of censure; they acted in an open and honourable manner, and he trusted
 102 103 ex post facto
 Mr. Hume  expressed himself satisfied with the explanation of the right hon.

 Mr. Hume  begged to put a question to the noble lord opposite, on the subject of the affairs of Portugal. Rumours were prevalent out of doors, that a large armament was about to be sent out from this country to Portugal, and that additional corps of yeomanry and militia were to be immediately provided to do the duty of the regular troops, who were to be called upon foreign service. These steps were, it was said, to be taken in consequence of the recent political occurrences in Portugal; and the effect of the rumour was to be seen in the depression and fluctuation of the funds. It was for the purpose of removing this alarm that he rose to ask the noble lord, whether he had any official information from Portugal respecting the recent events to which he alluded; and whether there was any ground for the alarm which was felt in the monied market?
 Mr. Huskisson  replied, certainly not.
 Lord Castlereagh  said, that it was a duty which the House owed to the memory of the individual, whose decease had just been communicated from the chair, to record upon their Journals the high sense which they entertained of his meritorious services.
 Mr. Tierney  said, that from some circumstances which had come to his knowledge, it was of great importance that the proceedings of this day, in the House of Lords, should be included in the motion.
 Lord Castlereagh  thought it was sufficient, to move generally for a committee to inquire into, and report upon the present state of the proceedings.
 Mr. Tierney  said, that any question not immediately connected with the innocence of her majesty, but connected with the manner in which the proceedings had originated, was a fit subject for the consideration of that House. He should move that it be an instruction to the committee to include the proceedings, of their lordships on this day.
 Lord John Russell  rose, to present a petition from the inhabitants of Plymouth against the bill of Pains and Penalties against her majesty. It was signed by 2,000 inhabitants, the largest number of persons who had come forward upon a public question since the petitions against the property tax. The petitioners prayed that if the bill should ever come down to that House, the House would immediately throw it out. They were of opinion, that this proceeding, whether considered in a judicial or political point of view, was calculated to bring the administration of justice into contempt, and to endanger the security of the country. As this petition had been entrusted to him, he felt it his duty to present it. He had no hesitation in declaring that he entirely concurred in the sentiments of the petitioners; and that if ever the bill should come down from the other House, as he sincerely hoped it would not, he should be ready in his place to oppose it in every possible way. Without entering into the merits of the evidence which had been delivered before the House of Lords, he might be permitted to say, that the result of that evidence was not such as to make the people of England believe the Queen guilty. If the pretence for this bill were a tender regard for the morals of the country, be conceived that the whole ground of it taken away; if it had been entertained as a public measure, in order to prevent the effects of a bad example, it
 751
 Mr. Lockhart  hoped that the House would pardon him for a short time, if he ventured to deliver his sentiments on the subject of this petition. That opinion was in entire concurrence with the sentiments expressed in the petition itself. He could not but regard its prayer, as he looked upon the mode in which this bill of pains and penalties had been instituted, and the record of which was now before them on their Journals, as not only a most unconstitutional violation of the parliamentary laws of this kingdom, but as endangering the safety of the lower and middling ranks, by first of all striking, as was the practice in former ages, at the lives of those who were in the highest. When he called such a mode of instituting a proceeding, and such a proceeding itself, a violation of the laws, he meant to say a violation of the statute of Edward 3rd, which was the statute of treasons, and a violation of the express declaration of our Magna Charta itself, which had ordained in these words:—"Nemo capiatur aut imprisonetur, aut aliquo modo destruatur; nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ." Now, this very bill of pains and penalties—this unjustifiable species of encroachment—was that "aliquis modus destruendi," which our ancestors had so well pointed out and with so much providence endeavoured to avert—a method of procedure which was now in a civilized age revived—which was at this day brought forward, against the authority of all precedents, and the force of all laws. He meant to say, and he said it unhesitatingly, that by this measure, the statute of Edward 3rd was
 752 753 ab initio, 754 755 "se l'on violast," 756
 Lord Castlereagh  declared, that he was quite astonished at the motion with which the hon. member concluded, as it was so very incommensurate with the opening of his speech. But that motion itself was of a surprising character. For he believed it was the first time that an application was made to that House, in the first instance, to take cognizance of the irregularity of any magistrate, the usual way being to make such application to the Court of King's-Bench. But as to the opening of the hon. member's speech, he distinctly charged the existence of a conspiracy for the purpose of fabricating and circulating seditious and treasonable publications, of which he alleged that his majesty's ministers formed a part. What! that ministers should become a party to a confederacy for exciting discontent, for promoting sedition, for contriving the means of endangering the security of the government, and of the constitution of the country, merely with a view to defeat an endeavour to procure a service of plate for the Queen? The hon. member had often drawn upon the credulity of the country, but he himself could hardly calculate upon the acceptance of such a draft at sight as his statement of this evening presented. There was not surely such a lack of libels in the country as to render the assistance of government necessary to the manufacture of such articles. Mr. Carlile, Mr. Hone, and Mr. Wooler, were found, he believed, to produce quite enough of sedition, or of inflammatory and treasonable placards, to satisfy the amateurs of that species of composition, and to forward their object, without any aid from his majesty's government, which it was their object to overthrow. But, if ministers were parties to the conspiracy, which the hon. member alleged to exist, how clumsily must they have proceeded, according to his description. They, indeed, if the hon. member's information were correct, had selected an agent for the advancement of their end, who must necessarily have been brought into public view; for, as that hon. gentleman had stated, Franklin, who had absconded, was the confidential friend of ministers, with whom he dined on one day, while on the other he was found in a carriage with a multitude of seditious placards, accompa-
 767 768
 Lord Castlereagh  maintained, that affidavits were produced by the hon. member from persons who stated that they had a knowledge of the proceedings of this alleged conspiracy since 1818, when the placard referring to sir Francis Burdett was promulgated during the Westminster election. Did the hon. gentleman then really mean, that persons who were so long in possession of the character and conduct of this plot, without making, until very lately, any disclosure upon the subject, were, entitled to the credit which he appeared to assume? The hon. member came forward with extra-judicial affidavits, which, if even full of falsehood, could not subject the deponents to any punishment; and yet, upon the faith which he claimed for such affidavits, he came down to that House to propose the institution of a parliamentary inquiry. If upon such grounds any proceeding was founded, it was scarcely possible to imagine into what awkward situations the House might be occasionally led. It must, indeed, suggest itself to any one acquainted with the laws of the country, that that House was not the proper place for such an inquiry as the hon. member desired to institute. Having said so much as to the folly and absurdity of the course which the hon. member proposed, with regard to a case already in a course of legal proceeding—
 Lord Castlereagh  said, he could not answer for a department of which he was not at the head; but he had no doubt there would be every anxiety shown to bring the author of those placards to punishment.
 Lord John Russell  expressed his satisfaction, that notwithstanding the activity with which those seditious and inflammatory placards had been circulated within the last few years, and the great distress and privation of most of the lower ranks of people during that time, they had been productive of so very little effect, and that it should be a matter of consideration, that perhaps some of those unfortunate persons who were now suffering in prison for having been connected with illegal meetings, might have been instigated by some of those placards.
 Lord Castlereagh  replied, that a warrant had been granted for the apprehension of Franklin, and, if justice should not appear to be duly administered, it would then be time enough to call upon that House to interfere. But, with respect to the case of Franklin, he would now state to the House an outline of what he understood to be the particulars of that case, and what remained, other gentlemen, from whom he obtained his information, would be ready to supply. It was only this day that he had been at all aware of the intention to bring the case before the House; and feeling it his duty to make every inquiry which the time afforded, he obtained all the information in his power upon the subject. But first he would assure the hon. member, that until
 769 770 ad referendum, 771
 Mr. Bennet  said, he knew not which was most to be admired, the lofty tone which the noble lord had maintained throughout his speech, or the lame and impotent conclusion, in which that speech had terminated. Surely, it might have been expected, that persons so anxious to prove their innocence before the House and the country would seize the first opportunity which presented itself for investigation. But the noble lord objected to examination even  in limine,; 773 774 in limine,
 Mr. Clive  declared, that the Home-office, in which he had the honour to hold an appointment, had no knowledge of the case of Franklin until the Monday after Franklin's arrest. It was the custom of sir Robert Baker to attend at the Home-office every Monday for the purpose of making an official communication. Upon the Monday alluded to, some conversation took place with respect to Franklin, and the boy detected in circulating the seditious bills. But the first information of Franklin's non-appearance was brought to the office by Mr. Minshull, who made the application referred to by the noble secretary of state. Mr. Pearson came immediately after Mr. Minshull. The latter might, indeed, have almost met the former going down stairs. Mr. Pearson left with him two hand-bills, the one issued with respect to the trial of Brandreth, and the other upon the subject of the Queen's plate. He answered the applications of Mr. Minshull and Mr. Pearson doubtingly at first, but upon reference to lord Sidmouth, to whom he showed the papers left with him by Mr. Pearson, he was instructed by his lordship to say, that it would be inconsistent with official practice to comply with these applications, or to interfere with the police magistrates, who had ample powers to take proceedings for the apprehension of Franklin. Of this Franklin he had heard for the first time on the Monday after his arrest; and
 775
 Mr. Gurney  declared his intention to support the motion. The worst symptom of the times was, the total want of confidence in the government of the country, which existed in all classes of the community, and amongst persons of every variety of political opinion. This want of confidence was an enormous evil, and it was the duty of the House to sift to the bottom any transaction which came before them in so questionable a shape as the present one. But his principal reason for rising was, to remark shortly upon a part of the speech of the noble secretary of state.—The noble lord had distinctly avowed, that he had given Mr. Pearson letters to the English ambassador at Paris, to aid him in the apprehension of Mr. Franklin. Now, it must be remembered, the offence charged was, the distribution of seditious hand-bills; and if the governments of Europe were under agreement to play into each other's hands in this way—mutually giving up persons who might be obnoxious to accusation for political misdemeanors, it would go, under the present circumstances of the world, to the establishment of the most unqualified tyranny. Our Alien act had been loudly declaimed against; but the enactments of our Alien bill shrunk into nothing, as compared with the exercise of arbitrary power, which it appeared the noble lord bad claimed of the government of France.
 Lord Castlereagh  rose to explain how the case stood as to the facts mentioned in the latter part of the hon. member's speech. The assistance which was occasionally rendered by one country to secure the persons who had fled from justice in another, was only given in consequence of mutual arrangements. This country had been applied to to make such arrangements; but there was not one of the powers which had made those applications, respecting the securing of murderers and forgers, to which it had not been told, that whatever assistance they might give us, we could not give reciprocal assistance, as it was repugnant to the spirit of our laws; for whatever notion existed that the Alien act had been indirectly applied to that purpose was quite erroneous; ail foreign powers had been informed, that
 776
 Mr. Gurney  said, his allusion was to the demand made for the giving up a person accused simply of seditious proceedings, and had no reference whatever either to murders, felonies, or other crimes.
 Mr. Bernal  wished to know whether the noble lord meant to let the matter rest in its present shape, and whether he would refuse that inquiry which was so necessary? Without imputing to the administration itself, a participation in the criminal matters which had been discovered, it was not too much to infer that there might be knaves and fools in the inferior departments of the government. Very grave facts had been stated, that had not been repudiated in any material respect. This fact especially remained unshaken, that notwithstanding the reasons stated by various gentlemen at the Home-office, steps were not taken to apprehend the offender, and that even as yet no reward had been offered, though in the case of the placard published at Glasgow, a reward of 500 l.
 Sir John Sebright  said, that in this, as in all other cases, he was the friend of the fullest inquiry, but he did not see any practical end that would be answered by calling sir Robert Baker to the bar. As to any participation which the government of the country was supposed to have had in the distribution of these placards, he could not conceive for a moment that they would have been so absurd as to commit such an act of suicide. The thing was improbable on the face of it, and he gave full credit to the assertions of the noble lord, which he had never any reason to question. He was sorry to agree with Mr. Gurney, that the government of the country was excessively unpopular, and that was a reason for the fullest inquiry. But, what was equally important, he was sorry to believe, that in such a state of feeling as existed, the people would be satisfied with no government whatever. The ministers had given reason for discontent; but all possible means had been employed to foment it.
 Lord Castlereagh , in explanation, denied having admitted, that the letters would be of no use. He had only stated, that foreign governments were not bound by any agreement to assist in the arrest of subjects of this country, except in the cases he had mentioned; but they had in many instances given that assistance, when they were not bound so to do. The case of the individual alluded to was only a misdemeanor, and they might if they pleased assist even in that.
 Mr. Clive  observed, that it was not the practice of the Home-department to offer
 780
 Sir G. Noel  said, he had before compared the House to a pack of hounds, who were whipped in or out by the noble lord as by the hunter. So, it seemed, he still resolved to treat them. He objected to so long an adjournment. They should continue to meet, to attend to the affairs of the nation at this critical period. He would move, as an amendment, that the House, on its rising, adjourn to to-morrow.
 Mr. P. Moore  seconded the motion.
 Mr. Tierney  said, he quite agreed with the hon. baronet, that the adjournment proposed was very much too long, but he was not prepared to support the amendment for an adjournment only till to-morrow. It was very extraordinary that now, after the trial had proceeded so far, a proposal should be made to them for a longer adjournment than was proposed at the very commencement. The noble lord knew better than he did, what was going on; but when he saw that there had been printed nearly 900 pages of evidence, he thought he was not hasty in concluding, that the proceedings were advancing towards their termination. Yet the noble lord had now proposed an adjournment longer than on any former occasion. He had thought, on a former occasion, that time should be allowed to see what the Lords would do, not understanding that he was to be at all bound by their proceedings. But the present motion made them quite subservient to the proceedings of the Lords. As a spectator of their proceedings, he imagined, that they would close in a week. If there was a possibility of that kind, why should they adjourn for so long a period? If the noble lord could inform the House that the bill of Pains and Penalties would never be heard of more in this place, then he was ready to adjourn, not merely to the 23rd of November, but to the 23rd of January. The noble lord had said, that if the bill were thrown out by the Peers, the order for the call need not be enforced; but surely, even in that event, there would remain many matters to be discussed of a most serious character. The noble lord must forgive him for saying, that in the public mind there existed a general indignation against ministers for the pass to which they had brought the country. It would be no adequate satisfaction to the nation to be told hereafter,
 785 786
 Lord Castlereagh  thanked the right hon. gentleman for the candour with which he had met the question. He would as fairly state the grounds upon which he differed with him. The calculation he had made was founded on nearly the same  data 787
 Mr. Tierney  said, that even if the proceedings in the House of Lords were not to close sooner than three weeks, the utmost inconvenience that would occur to members, would be, in case the House now adjourned over for a fortnight, that they might possibly be detained in town for three or four days before any particular business would be entered on; but, on the other hand, if they were to adjourn to the 23rd of November, they would be exposed to much inconvenience, and her majesty to much injury. He could not comprehend any inconvenience, if the House were to adjourn to that day three weeks, to be then peremptorily called over; to adjourn for five weeks, would be to do that for which no fair reason had been assigned.
 Sir W. De Crespigny  had no objection to the adjournment proposed, and trusted, that the reason for so long a separation was, a belief, on the part of ministers, that they would be enabled to get rid of a bill  in toto,
 Mr. Creevey  trusted, that his right hon. friend would forgive him for saying that he had met this question in rather a strange way. He little expected that he would have talked of the private convenience of members, instead of meeting the subject with some expression, on the part of the House, of an opinion that it never would permit the bill of Pains and Penalties to enter its doors. It was a most strange consideration, and at the same time a most melancholy one, that the House of Commons, that House which ought to be the guardians of the laws and the defenders of public liberty, were the only body in the nation who appeared insensible to the alarming consequences of this bill. He would ask them to look to the petition presented that night from Plymouth. From the language of that petition, the parliament might learn what was due to the laws and constitution of England from the common inhabitants of the sea-port town of Plymouth. On a former occasion, it was stated in that House, that if the bill should be ever attempted to be brought before them, the best way of proceeding would have been, to move an address to
 788 789 à posteriori;" * * 790 791
 Mr. Tierney  said, that he felt as warmly as any man, the constitutional objections to bills of pains and penalties. The principal difference between him and his hon. friend who spoke last being, that he (Mr. T.) was able in some degree to restrain and keep down his feelings. Yet he knew nothing of the evidence as a member of parliament; but he could not approve of the summary mode in which it had been proposed to get rid of it by a prorogation of parliament. Had he been in the House when it was moved, he should have voted against it. He begged clearly to be understood that it was not because he did not express his opinion at present that he was to be supposed to feel less warmly than others upon this subject.
 Mr. Scarlett  begged pardon of the House for rising at the present moment; but, after the call which had been made by his hon. friend, he deemed it incumbent upon every man to declare his unbiassed sentiments. He would not enter into a discussion upon the merits of the evidence; but he begged to state, that he, for one, would never, upon any public grounds yet promulgated, give his consent to this bill of Pains and Penalties. With respect to the measure before the House, it was so far connected with the proceedings in the House of Lords, as to entitle him to observe somewhat on those proceedings. They had before them a report, stating, that certain questions had been put to the learned Judges. Until he had heard that report read, he was altogether ignorant of its import. The import of those questions, if he understood them rightly, was, whether the House of Lords were entitled to inquire whether any undue and improper means had been employed to collect evidence against her majesty? He could only say, that if he had been of counsel for the prosecution against the meanest subject in the realm,
 792 793
 Mr. W. Courtenay  said, he felt as much impressed as any man with the impropriety of being drawn into any discussion upon this subject at this premature period; but he could not in silence hear one set of gentlemen arrogate to themselves all purity of principle, and deny it to those with whom they differed upon political topics. Let them pause, and see whether, in the case in which they were involved, there were any ground for all this reprobation so unsparingly heaped upon their course. What was the course of that proceeding? Reports of a most degrading nature respecting the princess of Wales [A laugh]. If gentlemen who opposed his views refused to listen to any thing at variance with their own preconceived opinions, then there was an end to all freedom, or, indeed, utility of debate. [Hear, hear!] Reports of a most degrading nature respecting the conduct of the princess of Wales had reached this country; and, putting out of view all the statements of Italian witnesses, it was said, that an English lady of high rank and character, had been obliged to withdraw herself out of the Queen's society in Italy. These statements called for inquiry, and the step taken was the natural and proper one. A commission—that much abused commission—was sent out in consequence. Steps
 794 795
 Mr. Calcraft  said, that he had meant to have complimented the hon. and learned gentleman, on the bold and manly course he had set out with taking, in defiance of popular feeling; but he found, in the progress of the hon. and learned gentleman's speech, that he must abandon this intention; for it seemed that, so far from having this boldness, he had happily and judiciously selected the favourable moment when he was to have the tide of popular feeling with him. For his own part, he must say, that, in the discharge of his public duty, he did not presume to know on which side of a question the tide of popular feeling ran. He always felt it to be his duty to take the course which his own judgment and sense of principle suggested, as becoming a representative of the people in parliament. But if he were to judge of the current of popular feeling on the question now in agitation, he should say that, so far from the tide being about to turn in favour of the opinion of the hon. and learned gentlemen opposite, the universal feeling was decidedly hostile to the pending investigation, and more particularly at the present time; and that, so far from
 796 797 798 799
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer  rose for the purpose of recalling the attention of the House to the subject actually before it, which was nothing more nor less than what was the proper period to which they should adjourn. He hoped he might be allowed to do justice to one of his colleagues who had been attacked by the hon. gentleman opposite; and he would appeal to the knowledge of every person, whether his noble and learned colleague had ever been swayed by any private or improper motive, and whether the most unimpeachable integrity had not regulated his conduct for a period of forty years. The question upon which they had now to decide was, whether it was consistent with their duty, and consistent with justice, that they should now take a short adjournment, or extend it to a period of five weeks. The hon. gentleman opposite had stated, that he did not apprehend that the proceedings would be closed in a shorter period than three weeks. It was expedient therefore to decide, whether it was better to adjourn to that period by which it was calculated the proceedings might be finished, or by extending the period of adjournment a little further, to make themselves almost certain, that when they next met they should meet with a reasonable probability of proceeding at once to the consideration of the subject. He apprehended that the interests of the public would be best consulted by adopting the proposition of his noble friend, and he felt certain, that if it should fall to their lot to take into consideration the question now occupying the other House of parliament, that they would do it with the same impartiality, and to the satisfaction of the public.
 Mr. Calcraft , in explanation, denied, that he had said a word in disparagement of the integrity of the noble and learned lord alluded to. As a Judge he believed him honest to the back-bone.
 Lord Folkestone  said, he was one of those who did not wish to confine the question to the mere motion of adjournment, and keep the merits of the great question wholly out of sight. Such might be the policy of the noble lord, who had left that consideration wholly out of his view; indeed, it was to be judged of, from the manner in which the speech of the only honourable gentleman who ventured to open his mouth on the subject was received. He thanked his hon. friend (Mr. Creevey) for the tone he had as-

 Mr. Hobhouse  said:—Sir; my sentiments having been so frequently declared on the subject, I should not now trouble the House, were it not for an observation which fell from the right hon. gentleman who has just sat down. That gentleman seems to think it exceedingly absurd and inconsistent, that the hon. member below me should describe the lord chancellor as being a respectable judge, although he cannot approve of him as a statesman. This criticism was so much applauded by the gentlemen opposite, that I rise to remind them, that there is nothing anomalous whatever in such a character, and that to consider such an inconsistency as unnatural, shows a most lamentable ignorance of human nature. Many names might be mentioned of judges, who, in causes between private individuals, have observed a strict impartiality, but have been notoriously profli-

 Mr. C. Calvert  joined in the suggestion to the member for Aberdeen to withdraw his motion. As to Sir R. Baker, he was convinced that he was as incapable of stating a falsehood as any man in or out of those walls.
 Mr. Gipps  could not vote for the motion, but said, that for several months past he had seen with indignation the activity with which placards of the most inflammatory nature had been circulated, to excite the people to discontent. He thought that this could not have been carried on to such an extent if the Home-department had been sufficiently active, and had employed agents either to pull down the placards, or to bring the authors to punishment.
 Mr. Tierney  said, he was very forcibly impressed by what had been said by an hon. gentleman as to the state of the public mind, which demanded a full inquiry into all proceedings of the nature of that which had been brought under their attention. The noble lord should bear in mind, that whatever he might say, whether the magistrates might be justified or not, whether the Home-department was in the right or not, a general impression prevailed in the country, that the government, in order to produce explosions, were accustomed to employ agents, who systematically urged the discontented to go greater lengths than they would otherwise go to. The fact, too, yet remained unexplained and unanswered, why a reward had not been offered. Here was a case in which a person had been distributing placards almost treasonable; he was apprehended, and taken to the Police-office, and then a different magistrate from the one who had caused him to be apprehended comes, and on what he considers the assurance of a respectable gentleman, discharges him. The man absconds—on the face of it this was an implication of guilt, and yet the government said, that there was on the face of this nothing which justified their interference! But what said the noble lord to this? Why, that it was all a dexterous plan of the radicals; and so because the noble lord was pleased to suppose that it might turn out to be a

 Mr. Tierney  entirely concurred with the noble lord, that the House was bound to mark its respect to an individual who had so long and so faithfully discharged the duties of the situation which he filled in that House.
 Mr. Brougham  said, he only wished to express his entire concurrence in the recommendation to his hon. friend to reconsider his motion, and to postpone his proceedings till the ordinary means of detection, and he might add, the ordinary means of defence had been resorted to; for though there might be a  prima facie 781
 General Gascoyne , in presenting a petition from the inhabitants of Liverpool, begged leave to call the attention of the House for a few minutes to the statements which it contained. He was aware that one topic occupied almost exclusively the attention of parliament and the public; still, however, the state of the country required that the House should take the subject of this petition into early consideration. The increase of pauperism in the town of Liverpool, which the petitioners ascribed chiefly to the distressed state of their trade, was truly alarming. So great was the increase, that not more than 20,000 of the inhabitants of Liverpool were rated. The population of that town was somewhat above 100,000, say 110,000; out of that number he was instructed by the mayor, who had called the meeting at which the resolutions upon which this petition was founded were passed, to inform the House, that 20,000 only were rated, and of these 7,000 were incapable of paying the annual rates. The petitioners were aware that the House had taken the

 Mr. Hume  said, No, from September last.
 Mr. Hume  said, he rose to call the attention of the House to a question of considerable importance, a question involving consequences more extensive than those who had not traced the progress of the mischief, as he had done, could easily believe, and calculated to bring before their view a series of proceedings, the manifest object and tendency of which was, to disturb the peace of the country. The motion with which he should conclude was, that sir Robert Baker, the chief magistrate of Bow-street office, should be called to the bar of that House to answer for his conduct, in permitting the escape of an individual charged with circulating a seditious hand-bill. He would prove, that the practice had been carried to a great extent, and that the mischievous consequences had spread further and been felt more severely, both in England and Scotland, than would on the first statement appear credible. The conspiracy, for a conspiracy he would call it, he would prove it to be such hereafter in the committee, as he had no doubt that the House would see the necessity of appointing one to investigate

I then asked his name and address; he answered, that was of no consequence, for I might rely,

 763 crim. con. 764 "Let us, in this mighty crisis, bear in mind, that the great are not our only foes. Those middle ranks who make us hew and draw; and dole their pittance to us according to their humour—these are our most grinding enemies. What is the constituent body but the tyrants of the non-represented? What are the ten thousand wretches who, in Westminster, voted against Mr. Hunt, but oppressors of their non-franchised fellow-citizens—content to crawl before the higher orders, that we may continue slaves to both. Alike then, and equal, be their common destiny. The brave, though starving outstanders of Manchester should be avenged in London. Shall non-represented Britons in such a cause, be scared by the fear of gibbets or bayonets? Be' our remonstrance to the Crown decorous, but let us, in one heroic day, convince mankind that the grievances of non-representation are now become insupportable.

 Mr. Hume  said, that though he still thought the motion which he had made was proper on the commencement of the inquiry, he should yield to the superior experience of others, and withdraw it. The noble lord had made a bold assertion when in defence of the placards he had said, that more seditious publications daily issued from the press of Wooler and Hone. If the noble lord was sincere, he had then passed the severest censure on the attorney-general, who had suffered them to go unnoticed. But he utterly denied that such was the fact, or that Mr. Hone or Mr. Wooler ever published anything like those placards. It was a piece of injustice, and only a trick of the noble

 The Speaker  said, he would venture to suggest the propriety of a motion, which it was competent for any hon. gentleman to make if he should think fit. It was in the power of any member to move, that the vote of the year 1797, passed in acknowledgment of Mr. Hatsell's services, should be now read, and the repetition of that vote would then form a part of the proceedings of this day. nem. con.
 The Speaker  said, he had to inform the House that John Hatsell, esq. late clerk of that House, died on Sunday morning and that his majesty would speedily appoint a clerk.
 Mr. Beckett  believed he had been misunderstood in what he had said with respect to sir Robert Baker. He had stated, and he repeated the assertion, that from the knowledge he had of that gentleman, he believed him wholly incapable of acting from a corrupt motive. But if any fault was found with his conduct, the King's-bench was the place where that conduct might be inquired into. As to the offering of a reward, it was not customary to

 Mr. Beckett  was anxious, in addition to the statement of his hon. friend, to mention, that in the course of his experience it was not the practice of government to offer rewards in such cases as the one alluded to. They usually offered rewards in cases of murder, burglary, and other cases of violence; and the reason was, that the party being likely to escape, the offer of a reward would tend to prevent the purposes of justice from being defeated; but it was only in cases where it was supposed that the ordinary methods would fail that such rewards were offered. But this application was made  instanter,
 Sir R. Wilson  wished to know whether, in case of the apprehension of Fletcher, the law-officers would be directed to prosecute? If not, the expense would fall upon individuals, and there would be no more possibility of redress, than there was for the sufferers at Manchester.
