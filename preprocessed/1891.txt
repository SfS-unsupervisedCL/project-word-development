 MR. J. E. ELLIS : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether for several years there has been no official guide obtainable at Kew Gardens; if so, how this arises, and when will the want be supplied?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland what number of "Rules" have been issued by the Irish Land Commission since its establishment; how many are now in force; and whether he will lay a copy of them upon the Table?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS : Have the rules been collected together in one form?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS : Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to do that?
 MR. J. LOWTHER  (Kent, Thanet) : I object.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : No regulations have been made, as it has not yet been found necessary to take that step.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I object.
 DR. TANNER : I rose to object, following on the lines laid down by the right hon. Gentleman the Chairman of Committees, who said he objected to the Amendment——
 DR. MACDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he is aware that threatening printed notices were issued by collectors of Inland Revenue, in the month of January and early in February of this year, called "Special Applications," calling for immediate payment, stating that payment was due on the 1st of January, and that if not paid at once steps would be taken; whether this course is adopted under instructions from the Department, and whether legal; if he can state, for the information of the public, upon what date payment of Income Tax is compulsory; and if the collectors of Income Tax are bound to pay to the Treasury as soon as received all moneys collected, or whether they may, and do, keep it to their own credit for some time?
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : Certain recommendations have been made and are now under consideration.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : No marriage has taken place on board Her Majesty's vessels since the Act was passed, and under the restrictions imposed by the Act it is doubtful if the solemnisation of marriages will hereafter occur on board ship. We have, therefore, issued no regulations on the subject.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : Arrangements have been made for taking over with the Naval Ordnance Stores a portion of the officers of the Ordnance Store Department, and the Storekeeper General of Naval Ordnance Stores has been specially selected from that Department as being thoroughly conversant with the Naval Ordnance Store duties, and to avoid any break in the continuity of the Naval Ordnance Store administration. It was also an integral part of the transfer that a portion of the Ordnance Store officers should be taken over by the Admiralty in order that there should be no increase of cost by setting up a new Staff.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : The reason given in 1867 was that Captains and Commanders only obtain appointments at intervals, and cannot, therefore, be considered as being on continuous service, whereas the officers to whom the leave was granted were considered as being virtually on continuous service. I cannot hold out any hope of altering this decision.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : The report is true, and the addition to the wages of certain classes of workmen is in the aggregate about £74,000 for the financial year ending April, 1892. As the hon. Gentleman will understand, the adjustment in all its details of any revised scale of wages affecting so many classes of workmen requires the very closest supervision before publication. In a few days I hope this task will be completed, and I will then lay on the Table of the House the Memorandum he suggests.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : I am informed there were a number of rules from time to time issued by the Land Commissioners appointed under the Act of 1881 up to the 12th December, 1883. On that date the Commissioners issued 151 general rules and orders in relation to proceedings in pursuance of
 38
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It is a matter which does not rest in my hands at all. If the hon. Member will put a question on the Paper I will inquire whether there is any objection.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I believe not.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am unable to give the whole of the Return asked for; but I believe some of the particulars indicated could be given. In 1889 I had a rough estimate prepared relating to the subject. It would not be practicable to give the extent of the holdings, nor to distinguish as to demesne lands. Subject to these two modifications, I would answer a question at a later date.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I cannot give the information for which the hon. Member asks to-day. I must, therefore, ask him to defer the question.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The question of the accommodation of persons awaiting trial at Police and Assize Courts in Ireland was fully investigated by the Irish Government in 1887 and 1888, and everything possible under the existing law was done to remedy any defects that were brought to light. No complaints have recently been made except as regards Green Street Court House, Dublin. In that case, however, the complaint is against the building generally.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I must ask the hon. Member to give me a longer notice of this question.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. SPEAKER : Objection is not sufficient; but as the hon. Member is
 136
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member is now too late; the Debate is adjourned.
 *MR. SPEAKER : A mere objection does not hold.
 *MR. SPEAKER : An hon. Member rose to object, and I said that a mere objection was not sufficient. Nobody then rose to move the Closure, and the hon. Member for Cork continued his speech, and as there was no indication of a Motion for the Closure, I was obliged to adjourn the Debate. When the Mover of the Amendment moved that the Question be now put, I informed him that he was too late.
 MR. PICKARD  (York, W.R., Normanton) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether his attention has been called to the case of "Frances Bennett  v. Sheffield Independent
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : I am not in a position to state what was the total expenditure by the Local Authorities and by the Crown in connection with the registration of Parliamentary electors in each of the Parliamentary Divisions of the County of London during the year ended 31st December, 1890. I do not think that it would be practicable to ascertain the cost of the registration of Parliamentary electors as distinguished from County Council electors, or that the information suggested could be obtained for each separate Parliamentary Division of the County of London. I believe that
 27
 *MR. RITCHIE : If the hon. Gentleman will put down his question upon the Paper I will answer it.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : It is not a Bill.
*(10.54.)  MR. RITCHIE : The course which has been pursued to-night with regard to the Motion before the House is, I think, a very inconvenient one. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Halifax without touching, or, at all
 121
 *MR. RITCHIE : I am quite aware of that; but I want to point out that 14,000 of the 18,000 are undoubtedly owners as well as occupiers; but they are registered as owners, although they vote as occupiers. The reason why they are registered as owners rather than as occupiers is that they are so registered under the Act of 1885, which enacts that unless a man who is both owner and occupier claims to be put on the register as an occupier, he is put on the list by the Overseer
 122 123
 *MR. RITCHIE : Surely the right hon. Gentleman must have been very hard up for a case if be had to go back to the Bill of 1832, seeing that there was a Bill passed in 1884. I understood him to mean the last Reform Bill. Looking to the fact that the Bill of 1885 enfranchised a larger number of persons than the Bill of 1832, it is clear that the franchise was wider than in 1832. Now the right hon. Gentleman proposes even to abolish the modified restrictions made by the Bill of 1885. I venture to say that a Resolution, which has for its object the abolition of ratepaying occupation, the reduction of the term of occupation, the establishment of successive occupation, and the principle of one man one vote, cannot be called a mere registration reform. If it can, I do not know what is meant by reform of the franchise. Registration reform, in my opinion, means the reform of the machinery of registration by which those persons entitled to the franchise by the Bill of 1885 shall be put upon the register. But the moment you abolish some of the
 124
 *MR. RITCHIE : I thought that the argument of the right hon. Gentleman was this—that if the Government accepted that Resolution it would be their duty to bring in a Bill.
 *MR. RITCHIE : Then I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman. Having admitted that there is a necessity for some reform, it may be fairly said, "Why do you not alter the law?" I will tell the right hon. Gentleman. We should have been very glad indeed to have taken in hand the reform of the machinery of the Registration Laws; but we knew that if we touched the question of registration every conceivable Amendment dealing with what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Halifax has touched upon would have been brought forward. The only qualification the right hon. Gentleman made in his speech was to admit that so far as one man one vote was concerned his proposal entailed more than a mere registration reform. The right hon. Gentleman admits that this is not a registration proposal, but a reform proposal. As far as we are concerned; we admit the necessity for a reform of the registration machinery, we do not admit the necessity for a Reform Bill; we do not think it wise or expedient or in the interests of the people. Now, with regard to the other part of the Resolution of the right hon. Gentleman, the most important part is undoubtedly that which deals with the abolition of dual voting. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian seemed to imply that all who could be included under that category were
 125 en bloc, 126
 *MR. RITCHIE : Those are comparatively few. That 73,000 has to be considerably reduced by those who, not being also occupiers, have only one vote. The right hon. Gentleman assumes that the great majority of those ownership voters are opposed to him and his Party; but if those ownership voters are equally divided it would be granted that the matter is not very material. You have to assume, before any great grievance is made out, that the great majority of those 73,000 votes are given for one Party, and when you consider the small number and the deductions that ought to be made the matter is seen to be, after all, an exceedingly small grievance on the basis of which to ask the House of Commons to put a stop to all progressive legislation, and to embark on a new Reform Bill. The question of Ireland has been raised this evening. According to voters there is no doubt that Ireland has 21 more Members than it ought to have. If, therefore, you compare the anomaly of plural voting with the anomaly which exists in Ireland the result is that the county voter, in consequence of the plural vote, has 5 per cent. less influence than he would have if it were abolished; whereas the Irish voter has 20 per cent. more influence than he would have if the representation were reduced to the fair proportion
 127 128
 *MR. RITCHIE : I maintain that for the right hon. Gentleman to tell an audience that the clergy had two votes to their one was throwing dust in their eyes. What the right hon. Gentleman meant was that the clergy returned two Members for the University of Oxford and two for that of Cambridge. This is what he called the clergy having two votes to their one.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I am speaking about the balance, the excess the right hon.
 129
 *MR. RITCHIE : The right hon. Gentleman calls upon the House to proceed instantly with this Reform Bill of his. And why? Because, he tells us, the next Parliament will have very much larger questions to deal with. That is to say, we are called upon by the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues to get rid of all these difficult questions in order that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues may deal with the larger questions which they have in their mind. The right hon. Gentleman said in effect that it was true that his Party did not deal with this question when they were in power, that they neglected their duty, that they left their obligations unfulfilled, that they are bankrupt debtors, and that they are now calling upon the present Government to take up their dishonoured Bills. But Her Majesty's Government decline to put a stop to the social legislation which they have in hand for the purpose of taking up those dishonoured Bills. No previous Parliament has ever dealt with our social problems to such an extent as the present one has. It has dealt with the sanitary condition of the houses of the working classes, with the question of Local Government, and it proposes to
 130
 *MR. WHITMORE : Yes; but the right hon. Gentleman said that "one man one vote" would produce this transformation, and possibly rustic labourers and miners when they hear statements of that kind feel inclined to vote for the abolition of the present system, but I do not believe that if concrete examples of the working of it were put before the people they would think it either unjust or inexpedient. The system in no way prevents the wage-earning class from gaining their objects by means of legislation. Supposing the wage-earning class were to demand persistently and unanimously a universal eight hours Bill, who could doubt that such a measure would be passed under the present system of plural voting in spite of the fact that the feeling of the educated classes is strongly unfavourable to such a measure? The object of the Resolution is to give to every vote an equal value, but if it were carried and if no redistribution followed there would be no real equality. The vote of the Irish elector would have an infinitely greater value than the vote of the English elector. The Amendment, therefore, is very relevant to the Resolution. Asking that the principle of equality should be logically applied, it would entail redistribution under which the North of Ireland would obtain votes at the expense of the South and West of Ireland, England would obtain votes at the expense of Ireland, and London and the more progressive, more contented, and therefore more Conservative parts of England would obtain votes at the expense of remote and less prosperous districts. Bat the present time I think is singularly inopportune for the introduction of such change. All the best minds on the other side of the House must, I suppose, be occupied with the problem how to frame a Homo Rule Bill which will satisfy both the hon. Member for Cork and the right hon. Member for Derby, and on my own side of the House the leaders are pledged by the events of 1886 to reconstruct the agrarian system of Ireland, and to propose for her a measure of County Government. And, while the minds of statesmen have been thus pre-occupied, a spontaneous wave of popular feeling has thrust upon them the consideration of the grave, delicate, and complex
 62
 *MR. WHITMORE : I beg the right hon. Gentleman's pardon; I said nothing of the sort. I said rather the opposite—that the maintenance of the plural vote would be powerless to prevent the passing of that Bill.
 *MR. WHITMORE : I am very reluctant to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman; but I cannot allow those words to be put in my mouth. I said the exact opposite. My whole argument was that there was no practical injustice in the plural vote, because it would not
 66
*(5.40.)  MR. WHITMORE  (Chelsea) : I rise to second the Amendment of my hon. Friend. I have myself on the Paper an Amendment which distinctly affirms the desirability of amendments of the Ragistration Laws, and of retaining the non-residential property qualification; but, as I do not wish to trouble the House with successive Amendments, and as I am substantially in agreement with my hon. Friend, I give my support to his proposition instead of submitting my own. We on this side of the House, I think, have no objection to an amendment of the Registration Laws, holding that the qualified voter should be enabled to effect registration as quickly and as cheaply as possible. We believe that technicalities which stand in the way of the accomplishment of that object are obsolete and mischievous. For my own part, I should certainly be only too glad to see, instead of our most capricious system, which depends on the casual activity of political parties, some fair-working State system which would enable the qualified voter to get on the register without trouble or expense. But these are not the points to which the Motion is addressed. The central and essential object of the Resolution is, of course,
 60
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University : The official guide to the Royal Gardens at Kew, which is at present out of print, is under revision. During the last two years the changes consequent on the re-arrangement of the Collection have been so extensive that it was thought better to suspend the publication of a guide which in such a period of transition would only mislead and be a cause of disappointment; but now that the re-arrangement of the Collection is drawing near its completion, the new guide has been put in hand, and I am informed by the Director (Dr. Dyer) that he hopes he may be able to get it out by next summer.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I have no power over the allocation of pews in St. Margaret's Church, any more than I had over those in the Chapel Royal at Whitehall. I am under the impression that provision is made for Members of Parliament at St. Margaret's, if they choose to attend.
 ADMIRAL FIELD  (Sussex, Eastbourne) : As I presided on the occasion to which the hon. Member alludes, if he will refer to me I will give him full information upon the point.
*(9.25.)  MR. HENEAGE  (Great Grimsby) : I should like to recall the fact that I have for a long time taken great interest in registration questions, and I much regret that in 1885 the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian (Mr. W. E. Gladstone) did not see his way to deal with the question of registration and shorten the term of residence. I must remind the House that, although that was the case, the Government then gave a very strong pledge that on the first opportunity they would endeavour to deal with the whole question of registration, and in the Mid Lothian programme of my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Lothian the question of registration was put in the forefront as one of the four questions that were ripe for legislation. I believe that every person who is duly qualified to be a voter is entitled to be placed on the register and to vote, and no person ought to be asked to place himself under any obligation to Party election agents—for the registration agents of the present day are nothing more or less than election agents—and, so far from endeavouring to add to the list of voters, they spend most of their time in trying to keep off the register those who will not vote in accordance with their wishes. I have long been of opinion that there should be some official person—whether a parish officer, or an officer of the County Council, or a Government officer—whose duty it should be to see that every person who is duly qualified is placed on the register. I think that as long as election agents are allowed to act as registration agents under present conditions the Corrupt Practices Act will be an absolute nullity, and I should like to see all their expenses included within the election accounts. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Halifax that the period of residence ought to be
 104 105 106
 *MR. HENEAGE : Yes, I am quite aware of that. I only mean to show that this is not only the case of the wealthy classes we have to take into consideration. We have been asked to vote for the principle of "one man one vote." That is a phrase. I have given reasons why I think this question should be thoroughly considered, and presented in the form of a Bill, and upon the principle expressed under the phrase "one man one vote" I keep an open mind, and am not prepared to give an opinion either way until I see the Bill. In taking that course I am following the example of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian in 1885. He said the Bill was not before the House and he would not discuss it. Indeed, I think since then he has taken up a similar attitude in relation to the eight hours movement. I am, therefore, in good company in taking this course. I shall on this occasion support the Amendment, and though hon. Members have described that Amendment as unfair and evasive I am quite willing to acknowledge that I have had a hand in that
 107
 *MR. DE LISLE : Let me explain. I found that the best way to get a Radical audience to give me a hearing was to let them first of all pass a vote of want of confidence.
*(8.53.)  MR. DE LISLE  (Leicestershire, Mid) : It does not appear to me that the hon. Gentleman who has just sat down has established his position; but he has only failed where the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian has failed, and the Mover of the Resolution. I hold that the Motion of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Halifax has been answered by the Amendment proposed on this side of the House, and I concur generally with the remarks made in support of it by the hon. Member for Salford, who condemned the Resolution rather by reason of what it omitted than for what it contained. In my short political career I have endeavoured to keep one eye upon principle and the other eye upon the people, and I have felt that so long as I was true to principle, though people might not always agree with me, I should still deserve respect. As far as I am able to judge of the feelings and wants of the people, there is very little of what they are supposed to demand contained in the proposal before the House. What the people required—that is to say, those who call themselves "the progressive and Radical" Party—is summed up under these heads: Universal Suffrage, Triennial Parliaments, Payment of Members, and Equal Electoral Districts. If I were disposed to ingratiate myself with this section of the people, this would be my programme: I should not be content with merely trying to get rid of the plural vote. It appears to me hon.
 97 98 99 "It is needful to amend and simplify the laws relating to the qualification and registration of Parliamentary electors." 100
*(9.42.)  COLONEL HUGHES  (Woolwich) : There can be no doubt that the Law of Registration requires simplifying and amending, for there are many anomalies the chief of which have not, I think, been mentioned by those who support this Bill. For instance, whereas the signature of a lodger is accepted as  primâ facie 108 109
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.)  postponed until Thursday a question to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture when the Bill which he has in preparation for the prevention of adulteration of artificial manures and feeding stuffs will be introduced and

 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : No, Sir; I am not prepared to cause the Bank to resume such yearly publications, for reasons which I think the hon. Member would appreciate if he should desire me to communicate them to him.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I have reason to believe that there have been cases in
 30
(4.56.)  MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : In rising to second the Motion. I desire to point out that this subject has been before the House since the early part of the Session of 1886. Session after Session we have had before us—although we have had no opportunity of discussing it—a measure not only containing the principles of the Resolution now before the House, but also laying down legislative machinery for carrying those principles into effect. With regard to the question of the franchise, I think hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite ought by this time to have got rid of their fear in regard to the extension of the franchise to the great mass of our people, and, consequently, they ought to get rid of any fear of giving to the people who are rightly enfranchised by Act of Parliament an opportunity of registering their votes. The principles of the registration at present in force are about as absurd as anything that could be put upon the Statute Book. In the first place they absolutely disfranchise people for following their employment. If a man happens to lose his work in one place and goes to another place to find it again he is at once disfranchised. If a number of men have a dispute with their employer, say in the County of Durham, and are evicted from their holdings in consequence, they have disfranchisement by the registration law added to their punishment—disfranchisement for two years at least. The householder does not occupy as good a position with regard to registration as the lodger, for he usually takes possession
 51 52
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether it is true, as reported in the newspapers, that the wages of certain classes of workmen are to be advanced; and whether he will lay upon the Table of the House a copy of the Statement or Memorandum of the proposed rates of pay compared with the present rates in all classes affected?
*(8.30.)  MR. G. G. LEVESON-GOWER  (Stoke-upon-Trent) : The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham, in the speech which he delivered earlier in the evening with his usual vigour and acuteness, complained that the Resolution of the right hon. Member for Halifax was of a piecemeal character, and did not definitely and finally settle the question. It has, Sir, been the
 93 94 95 96
*(10.21.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN : I am very sorry that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham is not present, because I wish to answer several of the right hon. Gentleman's challenges. The right hon. Gentleman challenged my right to speak in the Debate at all, quoting in support of the contention a sentence from one of his speeches on the Reform Bill of 1884, namely—
 "No man will be troubled by the franchise again. It admits every man who should be admitted, and it excludes no man who should not be excluded." 115 "There is another question. I am in favour of the principle of one man one vote, and I object altogether to the plural representation of property. I will take my own case; I am a terrible example. I have three votes for borough constituencies and the same number for county constituencies. That is to say, I have six votes. I use them on the right side; but I know many of my friends who have 10 or 12 votes, and I have heard of one reverend pluralist who has 23. I consider that this is an anomaly altogether inconsistent with the principle upon which we stand." 116 117 and laughter from the Ministerial side of the House. 118 119 120
 *SIR G. TREVELYAN : I can only use the Returns that the right hon. Gentleman and the Government have put into my hands. Wherever the question was one of non-residence I carefully used the Non-residence Return. There is no Non-residence Return for Ireland, and I was only able to use the Return in which the plural voters for Ireland and England are described, and I refrained from calling them non-resident purposely.
 *SIR G. TREVELYAN : Non-resident and occupation voters.
 *SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : A much greater man than the Member for the Bridgeton Division used that expression in connection with Parliamentary Reform. It was Mr. John Bright.
 *SIR G. TREVELYAN : I stated that they voted for their local Members and for the Members for Universities.
 *SIR G. TREVELYAN : It would be fairer to read the whole passage. I named other people besides the clergy—brewers, ground landlords, and others—and showed how difficult it was to approach social questions while these classes had plural votes.
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will cause the Governor and Company of the Bank of England to resume the yearly publication of "the names and descriptions of the proprietors of unclaimed dividends in the public funds which became due before 31st December in each year, with the dates when the last dividends became payable, and the number of dividends due."
 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether he will give facilities to enable a Bill to be passed to cause the writers of all editorial articles in newspapers to sign what they write and publish their names with the articles, so that the public may know in each case how much or how little attention is due to each article?
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : May I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman will undertake that one Member of the Commission shall be a person who has special knowledge of subjects relating to agricultural labourers
 35
*(5.10.)  MR. HOWORTH  (Salford, S.) : The right hon. Gentleman who introduced this Motion has hung a very wide and far-reaching issue upon a very small and innocent-looking Resolution, and he may find, as others have done
 53 54 55 employés 56 57 58 59
(12.15.)  Mr. HOWORTH  rose in his place, and claimed to move "That the Question be now put."
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have received a Report from the Magistrates, from which I gather that the facts are as stated, and that, in dismissing the charge, the Chairman observed generally that the police had only done their duty in seeking to bring home the offence to the landlord if they believed the soldiers to be drunk at the time. The Chief Constable informs me that the usual practice is for the police when they see a person whom they consider the worse for liquor enter a licensed house to enter them selves and caution the landlord.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : With regard to Sessions and Assize Courts in England, I am glad to inform my hon. Friend that as the result of correspondence during the last year there are 26 additional places in which the accommodation may now be regarded as satisfactory, bringing up the total number of such places to 145. There are 42 places in which improvement is desirable, and correspondence is still going on with hopes that a satisfactory result will shortly be arrived at. There are two cases in which the Local Authority have have failed to comply with requirements of the Secretary of State. I hope my hon. Friend will not ask me to name them publicly, as I trust the force of example may still influence them in the right direction. With regard to Police Courts I am not able to give complete explanations within the limits of an answer; but I can assure my hon. Friend that substantial progress is being made, especially in the Metropolis.
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : May I ask what is the method by which it is proposed to obtain the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council?
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether the Scotch Education Department have any Returns showing the number of children in Scotland attending other than State-aided schools; if so, what was the date of the last Return; how many children were on the School Register and in average attendance at such schools in all Scotland; and what were the increases or decreases on such School Registers and in average attendance since any previous Return, and the date of such previous Return?
 MR. DUNCAN  (Barrow-in-Furness) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the reference to the Royal Commission on the relations of employer and employed will embrace an examination of the limits set by the existing Law of Conspiracy (by Statute or at Common Law) to lawful combinations in connection with trade disputes, and the consideration of the expediency of amending the law so as to strengthen or extend the right of combination?
*(7.40.)  MR. J. M. MACLEAN  (Oldham) : The hon. Member who has just sat down travelled far beyond the issues raised by the Resolution of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Halifax. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian in his opening remarks made it a matter of complaint that this Resolution is opposed by so many Amendments when there is a general agreement that these questions ought to be dealt with. But if the Member for Halifax had simply brought in a Bill to amend and make smooth the working of the machinery for registration, I am quite sure it would not have encountered that kind of opposition with which his Resolution is met on this side of the House. His Resolution is opposed because, while seeking ostensibly to improve the machinery of registration, it affects the principle on which the franchise itself is based, and we have come to the conclusion that if that question was raised at all it is necessary that the whole subject of the franchise should be fairly dealt with. Now, with regard to that part of the Resolution which deals with registration alone, I think we are all agreed that it would be a very good
 89 90 91 92
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland can he state the cost of keeping three policemen on Castle Island, adjacent to Schull, County Cork, and if the rent is annually £96?
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the temporary obstacles have been removed which prevented the immediate fulfilment of Her Majesty's Gracious promise to King Ja Ja, that he should be restored to his Native land; what is the present condition of Ja Ja's health; and whether the Government have adequate assurance that he can survive a much longer banishment from his Native climate?
 MR. PICTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman give any undertaking as to the length of time which may have to elapse, or are we to regard the promise as having been withdrawn?
 *MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The statistics of the school supply, based upon Returns made by School Boards, were given in a Blue Book laid before Parliament in 1888. According to this the elementary schools, recognised by School Boards as efficient but not in receipt of State aid, contained accommodation for 29,770, and had an average attendance of 18,307. A similar Blue Book was issued in 1880, and according to it the accommodation in such schools was 50,031. The average attendance at that date was not given in the Returns; nor did either of the Returns state the number on the School Registers.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : As my hon. Friend is possibly aware, a Report was made to the Secretary for Scotland by a Departmental Committee, appointed to inquire into this matter. Following upon this Report communications were addressed to the responsible authorities of those Court-houses specially named in the Report as requiring alterations. In certain cases the Secretary for Scotland has been informed that the necessary alterations have already been carried out.
(9.57.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : The hon. Member's idea is an interesting and amusing one, but I think novelty is its only recommendation. Our object has been to shorten as much as possible the time of the House occupied in Division, but I am afraid the plan suggested would considerably lengthen the time. There was one feature about the speech of the hon. and gallant Gentleman I recognised, and that was the frank manner—and I think he is the first on that side who had done so—the frank manner in which he defended the system of plural voting. He affirms his right to vote for office in the Strand as well as residence in the country, and this is the issue so many Members on the other side of the House have evaded. How does the system work in London? In my own constituency there is a firm of house agents. This firm used to have five members on the register for East Finsbury. I am glad to say we have now reduced the number to four, one being disqualified on the ground of not being within the seven miles limit; but they have this number on the register simply because they are qualified as agents for a wealthy Corporation—the Ecclesiastical Commissioners—and in several other boroughs on the same ground Messrs. Clutton have representation. What justification can there be for this? Votes such as this turn the scale against the votes of responsible citizens. Now let me come to an issue with the hon. and gallant Member for Woolwich. We are not dealing with local rates; we are dealing with the Imperial franchise; and the interests of one citizen should be equal to that of another. The moment you go away from that as the basis of the rights of citizenship you are landed in difficulties. Now there has been an extraordinary want of perception shown by several Members of the meaning of the expression "one man one vote." As helping to an explanation, let me give another illustration from the home county. There is for the Hornsey Division a polling place inside Guildhall. It is a known fact that the election for the Hornsey Division is settled, not in that Division of Middlesex, but in the City of London—three or four miles away.
 MR. J. ROWLANDS : Does the hon. Member deny that there is a polling place for the Hornsey Division in the Guildhall?
 MR. J. ROWLANDS : Yes; I admit that, but we know very well that the proportion is 2,500 on one side, and 500 on the other. But I do not care whether it is this side or the other side that have the vote. I deny that any Division should be represented in this way—that instead of the persons who reside in the area having the right to say who shall be returned, it should be settled outside. We are only trying tonight to extend that which has been going on for a long time; we are only trying to enforce the principle which was advocated when the Reform Bill of 1832 was passed, which was advocated again in 1867, and again in 1884, and which will have to be advocated again and again until the franchise is put upon such a basis that it will give us a sound and reliable reflex of the opinion of the people. As to electoral districts, I have not heard any objection from this side of the House to putting them on as fair a basis as you can. We know, for instance, that London is over-represented, and that it should only have one Representative instead of two, and we know that under any system of proportional representation that view would be taken. But I do not wish to go into detail in this matter. We are prepared to carry on the work as it was carried on in 1885; but, as has been pointed out, in 1885 there was a compromise. Many of us would have liked to see the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian go further than he did. He had to satisfy both sides, and to meet the opposition of the House of Lords. He provided in his measure, however, that all boroughs of less than 50,000 inhabitants having two Members should lose one Member, and all with loss than 15,000 inhabitants having one Member should lose their Member and be included in a county district. That was an improvement; but no one on this side of the House ever thought that in that way finality had been reached. We

 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he is aware that the business of the Hansard Publishing Union, Limited, has recently been taken over by a Receiver; if so, whether the Government contract is affected there by; and whether care will be taken that no inconvenience or loss shall arise to the public service through these financial difficulties of the contractors?

 MR. J. O'CONNOR : I think it is desirable that we should have further information, and therefore I will ask the hon. and gallant Admiral how he can reconcile——
 MR. J. O'CONNOR  (Tipperary, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the report of a case heard at the Gosport Petty Sessions on November 4th last, in which a charge against George Phillip Thornton, for selling beer to an intoxicated person on the 29th of October was dismissed, from which it appears that a police constable called Payne deposed to having watched two drunken soldiers enter the house: that he and another constable called Gill afterwards watched these drunken persons through a glass door being served with beer; and that the Bench, presided over by the hon. Member for South Sussex (Admiral Field), stated that the police had done their duty, and that Payne was justified in his action; and whether the police acted in accordance with their instructions and usual practice in this case?
 MR. J. CHAMBERLAIN : I accept the statement. I told my right hon. Friend the source from which I derived it, but I am perfectly unable to attempt to verify it, and after his contradiction I should not think it necessary to do so. However, this is my point. At the time of which I am speaking my right hon. Friend had a programme of what I call practical and material reform. Well, of that programme only a very small portion has been dealt with up to the present time. Take Local Government, for instance. We have made a great

You will tell them, "In the first place, there is the eternal question of Home Rule; to that we stand pledged to our Irish allies; our faith and our honour are pledged, and that must be the first part of our programme." Then you will have to say, "In the second place, and when we have satisfactorily dealt with Home Rule to the satisfaction of those Irish allies—those who are our allies and those who were our allies—we have then to come to the second item of our programme, and that is 'One man one vote,'" and it is not until you have accomplished that that my hon.

 SIR R. FOWLER  (London) : No, no.
*(10.15.)  SIR R. FOWLER : With regard to the reflections which the hon. Member who has just sat down has cast upon my constituency, I must say I do not think any fair-minded man can feel that a constituency which comprises 32,000 electors is not entitled to send two Members to Parliament. That constituency in the last Parliament returned me as one of their Members by the largest number of votes that ever returned any Member to this House. As regards the immediate question before the House, I have placed an Amendment on the Paper, which, however, I shall obviously not have opportunity to move. What I wish to protest against is that after this House in 1885 went into the question of the representation of the people in Parliament, and discussed the matter at great length, and arrived at a comprehensive measure upon it, only five or six years afterwards we should have the question re-opened. I think we should have a little rest. If we look back at what has happened in the past we shall see that the greatest change made in the representation of the people was that brought about in 1832. No attempt was made to re-open the matter until 1852. I do not say that there were not Motions made by private Members of Parliament, but no attempt was made by a responsible Minister or ex-Minister. From 1852 no attempt was successful until 1866, and the Act of that year was allowed to remain in operation 18 years before the question was again re-opened. I think now it is only fair that this question should be allowed to rest, and certainly should not be re-opened in what is practically the first Parliament after the settlement of 1885. The Home Secretary the other day, in reference to a Debate raised by the hon. Member who has just sat down, said it seemed to him that hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition side who re-opened the question of reform had, no doubt, expected when the Act of 1885 was passed that that Act would place them in power for 20 years to come. That was their opinion, and it certainly was mine. If I could have imagined in 1885 that at this moment I should have been speaking from this side of the House it would have been a great surprise to me. Of course this subject is being re-opened because Gentlemen opposite do not find

 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether any decision has been arrived at with reference to the Memorial forwarded last April by the established messengers of Her Majesty's Customs for an amelioration of their condition?

 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : Are not further proceedings governed by the 12 o'clock Rule against opposed business?
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : I did not call upon the Government to correct a grievance. I stated that the responsibility of correcting it rested with those who proposed this Resolution.
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : Nothing of the kind.
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : Then I certainly misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. It seemed to me from the hon. Member's speech that in his opinion the plural vote would be of great value to the other classes of the community, if they were under the necessity of drawing on their whole resources, of increasing their means of resistance to an almost unanimous demand by the wage-earning classes. Then that is not an argument for the plural vote. It is now loudly professed from the other side of the House that it is no part of the value of the plural vote to increase the weight of the upper classes where their judgment might come into collision with that of other classes. I trust that the hon. Gentlemen who sit near the hon. Seconder of the Amendment will dismiss that argument from their minds, and will confess that the plural vote is of no value whatever for that purpose. Then why is the plural vote to be maintained? The hon. Member—and I do not think I misunderstood his argument—has brought me to the perception of another valuable political truth, which I hope will be universally accepted on both sides of the House. I am afraid he will find that it very much weakens the power of hon. Members on that side of the House and their allies on this side to maintain the plural vote. The hon. Member says he relies upon the authority of John Stuart Mill. He says that John Stuart Mill was in favour of the plural vote. Yes; but of a plural vote as absolutely different and as directly contradictory in every point to the present plural vote as can be. Mr. John Stuart Mill, looking at this matter with the eye of a philosopher, virtually framed his ideas by the principle laid down by Mr. Burke—namely, that wisdom and virtue are the true titles to government. And Mr. Burke in that remarkable declaration does not admit any other title to government. Mr. John Stuart Mill wished to have wisdom and virtue, and to adapt the measure of political power that each individual was to enjoy to the amount of wisdom and virtue which he might be happy enough to possess. But what

 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : Then why was it used as an argument for the plural vote? I will not say it was stated that it would prevent the passing of the Bill, but, undoubtedly, as far as I understood the purport of the argument, it was referred to as an argument for the plural vote—that it was by means of a plural vote that the other classes of the community would be able to retard the passing of such a measure.
(5.59.)  MR. W. E. GLADSTONE  (Edinburgh, Mid Lothian) : Although there are portions of the speeches of the Mover and Seconder of the Amendment which I heard with regret, I think that, upon the whole, it will be obvious to the House that already progress has been made in and by this Debate. It has been admitted both by the Mover and the Seconder—and I venture to hope, and even to presume, that after their admissions it is not likely to be denied—that the system of registration admits and requires amendment. Now, what is the meaning of that? The meaning of that is that a body, and evidently a considerable body, of our fellow subjects have a distinct political grievance. Let us see what this signifies and what it intends. If there are in the country a body of persons whom Parliament has declared to be qualified and entitled to vote for Members of Parliament, and if by the mechanical arrangement of your Registration Law you have so ill-adjusted the conditions of your electoral system that large numbers—many thousands, aye, even tens of thousands of men are kept off the register and away from the power of voting which Parliament in principle has given them—that is a political grievance. In regard to that political grievance it appears that there is a union of opinion. If there be that union of opinion, what is the reason why the grievance should not be removed? If my right hon. Friend has included in his measure other matters upon which hon. Members have a difference of opinion, the consistent course for them to take is not to block the Bill of my right hon. Friend by a hostile Amendment, and thereby prevent the removal of a political grievance which they themselves have admitted and confessed ought to be removed. Their proper course would be to carry the Bill of my right hon. Friend into Committee, and there to avail themselves of the majority which they know they possess.
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : Well, then, it is a Resolution intended to be followed by a Bill. If it were not I should feel very little anxiety to support it. I say they themselves ought to allow this plan to go forward and be dealt with as a Bill in Committee, and at that stage endeavour to exclude from the Bill that which they deem to be dangerous. I was sorry to hear in the speech of the Mover of the Amendment attacks on the Irish people, which I do not think added anything to the strength of his case, and which on general grounds would better have been omitted. I would wish, however, to relieve the mind of the hon. Mover of the Amendment with respect to one particular to which he appeared to attach great force, and where he is, no doubt, in historical error. He stated that the Franchise Bill was the result of a diplomatic arrangement, and that that diplomatic arrangement was intended to convey, and did convey, an assurance not of absolute finality, but of that kind of relative finality which is sometimes perfectly well understood to attach to political measures. Sir, the Franchise Bill was in no respect the result of a diplomatic arrangement. The Franchise Bill was passed in this House in 1884, and was thrown out in the House of Lords; but the apology made for throwing out that Bill was always a reference to the difficulties of a system of redistribution of seats. The redistribution of seats, it may be said, was the result of an arrangement between the two Parties in the House, and possibly the argument of the hon. Member might have some relevance as far as that is concerned. But as far as the Franchise Bill is concerned, so far from its having been proposed as a measure which in its then shape was final, it was a measure the entire principle of which was absolute simplicity. We confined the announcement of a great principle, a great proposition, as far as possible within the very narrowest limits, because we knew that if we attempted to conjoin with the assertion of that principle a multitude of amendments of our system in detail we should become lost in the wilderness of that

 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Apart from the fact that it is really impossible for me to ask the House to give precedence to the measures of private Members, the suggestion of my hon.

The Government would be unwilling to restrict the liberty which, with rare exceptions, is very far from being abused.

 MR. JACKSON : The Treasury has authorised the appointments named by the hon. Member, subject to the approval of the Civil Service Commissioners. In reply to the fourth question, I have to say that the Treasury took this action because representations from the authorities of the three Departments satisfied them that there was, in each Department, work for a certain number of men which, while superior to that properly assignable under regulation to copyists, might suitably be performed by established officers of a class special to each Department and below the rank of the Second Division. The Treasury Minute laid before the House, of the 10th of August, 1889, paragraph 29, states the conditions on which such officers can be employed.

 MR. WOODALL  (Hanley) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs what regulations have been made, or instructions given, for the carrying out of "The Marriage Act, 1890," by Her Majesty's Ambassadors and Consular or other officers; and what arrangements have been made for the registration, in pursuance of the Act of marriages of British subjects, whether solemnised under its provisions or in accordance with the local law of a Foreign country?
 *SIR WALTER FOSTER  (Derby, Ilkeston) : Has there been any recent information as to the health of King Ja Ja? It was recently reported that he was in a very dangerous state of health.
*(9.12.)  SIR WALTER FOSTER  (Derby, Ilkeston) : I feel in some difficulty in reference to this Debate, because I have a good deal of sympathy with many of the opinions that have been expressed from the opposite side of the House. It is a common device for one side to taunt the other side with not going far enough, and I am in hearty sympathy with hon. Members opposite who have discovered a new-fangled zeal for such radical doctrines as the payment of Members and equal electoral districts. I feel that the ideal to which we are seeking to attain would be that which would give us not only the principle of one man one vote, but manhood suffrage, equal electoral districts, and payment of Members. But when we have had a Division as to the payment of Members, for instance, I do not remember that the hon. Member (Mr. de Lisle) has been found as a supporter of that proposal. I am, therefore, obliged to receive the hon. Gentleman's expressions of sympathy with such a project, as simply a pious opinion, used for the purposes of debate. I am not astonished that a pious opinion should be uttered by a gentleman who has given us a prescription for losing a constituency. The hon. Gentleman has told us that he keeps one eye on principle and one eye on the people—a performance that must necessarily cause obliquity of vision. I know it is a difficult process for the hon. Member to reconcile his principles with those of the people he represents, because I believe that no Member of the House of Commons within the memory of sitting Members, has received so many votes of want of confidence as the hon. Gentleman.
 *SIR WALTER FOSTER : The explanation of the hon. Member does not make his case better. If that is the only way for him to get an audience in his constituency he is not likely to sit again in the House of Commons—at all events, for the Loughborough Division. Now,

 *SIR WALTER FOSTER : Bat they will have their votes for the borough.
(7.14.)  SIR E. GREY  (Northumberland, Berwick) : I do not think the argument of the right hon. Gentleman was consistent or showed that he had a strong case behind it. The first part of the speech was devoted to showing that the subject of the Resolution was so grave and so serious that even the Government with its large majority could not afford the time to deal with it; while the second part he devoted to explaining how very small and infinitesimal the question is. The course pursued by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham in respect to the Motion was a very remarkable one, and not a few of the conclusions he drew as reasons for opposing it must have been very inconvenient to hon. Members opposite. The right hon. Gentleman is in favour of manhood suffrage, of equal electoral districts, and of the payment of Members, and yet so insignificant is this Motion, which involves a great principle of justice to the people, that he can not even bestow upon it his support. He said it was dangerous to make promises that a Government were not prepared immediately to perform. Well, I venture to say that this Government have made such promises when they were not prepared for immediate action, and we have the everlasting example of the promise of local government to Ireland. When this Resolution was put on the Paper it appeared to be so reasonable that hon. Members opposite would not oppose it, but since then we have seen them engaged day by day in the construction of ambushes in order that their real intentions in opposing the Resolution should not be disclosed. Whenever it is proposed to deal with the franchise three objections are sure to be raised on the other side of the House—that there is something in the condition of Ireland which renders it impossible to do so, that if anything is done there must be a

 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : A copy of the "Marriage Act, 1890," was sent to Her Majesty's Diplomatic and Consular officers on the 1st December last, and their attention was called to certain modifications which had been made thereby of the provisions of the "Consular Marriage Act, 1849." "The Marriage Act, 1890," authorised the issue by Her Majesty of an Order in Council to determine the conditions under which and the mode in which marriages solemnised in accordance with the local law of a Foreign country might be registered by a Consul abroad, but doubts have been raised as to how far Her Majesty would be justified in issuing an Order in Council with regard to marriage fees and other matters connected with  lex loci
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : No, Sir; not at all. I said on a former occasion that the delay was owing to the necessity of establishing a better form of administration in the Oil Rivers district. There have been certain financial arrangements to be made, but I believe that they are now nearly settled, and I hope that it will not be long before everything is finally settled.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : The obstacles have not yet been removed. They arise from the necessity of preventing the introduction into the Protectorate of an element dangerous to its tranquillity while the administration is being organised. Ja Ja's state of health is not good, and no time will be lost in

 MR. LENG  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether there is any fund under the control of the War Department from which contributions might be made, in extremely necessitous cases, to sick and infirm veterans who served in the Crimean War, but who are not in the receipt of pensions?
 *THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : I have written to the learned County Court Judge, who informs me by telegram that the report in the paper referred to by the Hon. Member is inaccurate. Beyond that, I am unable to give an answer at present, and must ask the hon. Member to repeat the question on Thursday.
 SIR T. ESMONDE  (Dublin Co., S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland with reference to the case of Miss Quane, who has been sent to gaol at Tipperary on the charge of "hooting the police," would he explain in what the alleged crime consisted, and under what law it is punishable; upon what evidence was

*(5.19.)  MR. H. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : My colleagues and myself will assent to this course, but it must be borne in mind we do not therefore pledge ourselves to the principle of the Bill.
*(3.15.)  MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : I hope the House will note that only one Metropolitan Member has at present ventured to oppose this Bill, the hon. Member for Newington (Mr. Cooke). The hon. Gentleman made what the colonists call a cross-eyed speech; he was thinking, not of constituents, but of that farm in his own county about which he gave us such interesting details. But so far as his agricultural leases are concerned, he may make himself quite easy, as the Court has power to grant or refuse the application. I am bound to say I have not been able to understand or interpret the cheers with which the Attorney General has been encouraging the opponents of the Bill. They have made attacks on the Bill of 1881, and they have declaimed about interference with freedom of contract, although they know well enough that Lord Cairns in that Statute interfered every bit as much with existing contracts as the hon. Member for St. Pancras does in his Bill. Those who have gone into the leasehold question of London know how vast are the interests at stake and how they are placed in jeopardy by the restrictions made in the Act of 1881. In many of the outskirts of London the leasehold exceeds the freehold interest. The doctrines of equity, as explained by Chief Justice Storey, to the effect that the test should be either "due performance or the damage really incurred," are sufficiently wide to cover any such proposal; but, unfortunately, the rules of the Courts have become crystallised in a groove. It seems to me there is no more valuable part of this Bill than the 3rd clause, which provides that licence and consent shall not be unreasonably withheld from a breach of covenant and that no fine shall be paid in respect of such licence and consent. Evidence has been given before the Town Holdings Committee to show that in some cases covenants have been deliberately used, not for the purpose of safeguarding the amenities of a neighbourhood, but in order to extort in-
 173
 *MR. SPEAKER : Does the hon. Member withdraw his objection?
 MR. COOKE : Yes, the right hon. Gentleman allowed there were exceptions. I had not the advantage of hearing the whole of his speech, and so I will not attempt to reply to it. What I have to say applies chiefly to agricultural leases, for with these I am best acquainted. In the present day it is not an unlikely thing for a tenant farmer, where a farm is in good condition, to take that farm, and in a limited number of years he runs it out; and if this Bill were to become law he would be able to under-let the farm against the will of the landlord—or if not against the will of the landlord, at any rate he would go to the Court to determine the question whether the man proposed to be put in was solvent or not. But that is not the tribunal to determine whether a man is a fitting-tenant to farm the land. An instance came under my observation a few months ago. I had a farm to let in good condition—I farmed it myself—and I had many applications. Among the applicants was a gentleman extremely anxious to take the farm. I was not certain about his position, nor is it easy to ascertain a man's position. When you go to a man's banker the banker will say, "If he wants accommodation then I know a man's condition; but if he does not want it, I do not know his circumstances." Well, it happened that this gentleman did not take the farm. He took a farm about a couple of miles off, and in four months became a bankrupt. Upon my farm he, perhaps, would have lasted a little longer, for my farm was in the better condition. Now, if this Bill were law, that tenant might have run out the farm and sub-let, and I should have had no relief whatever. The one
 167
 MR COOKE : Yes, the Act is there dealing with exceptions. I rest my strong opposition to the Bill chiefly on the ground of agricultural tenancies, for I am convinced from experience, not only on my own property, but as having had the management of a large property, that the Bill contains a power it would be extremely disastrous to place in the hands of tenants at this juncture.
(2.40.)  MR. COOKE  
(Newington, W.) : The Act of 1881 was prepared by one of the ablest lawyers of the day; it was referred to a Select Committee, upon which sat many well-known lawyers, and Sub-section 6 of Section 14, and the subjects connected with it, were no doubt thoroughly discussed by that Committee, and that Committee came to the conclusion to leave the sub-section as it stands ill the Act—I presume because they thought that the persons contracting on this particular subject were able to make good contracts for themselves and
 166
(4.30.)  MR. C. W. GRAY  (Essex, Maldon) : I am not going to encroach unduly upon the time of the House, but I should like to say a word or two from the point of view of the agricultural tenants. I have never understood that the agricultural tenants as a class have asked for a Bill of this kind, or have asked for powers as to subletting. It would be unwise, in my judgment, to make a sweeping change in the law affecting landlord and tenant until that change has been asked for by the tenants of the country. If the Bill passes in its present form, it will lead to a great deal of litigation. Is it not a fact that during the last 12 years of severe agricultural depression the, class, of farmers who have been enabled to tide over that disastrous period have been the tenants on large estates, and whose forefathers have occupied the same farms? I am quite sure that the tenant farmers on those large estates would not wish to have a change of this kind as between themselves and their landlords. Over and over again the landlords of those large estates have chosen their tenants because they knew the capabilities of those men, because they believed in them, because they were the sons of previous tenants, and possessed a practical knowledge of how to conduct farming operations in the best way in which they could be carried on. Many a large landlord during those 12 years of agricultural distress has let his farms at a rate below what he might have obtained for them in the open market, because he valued those qualities of his tenants. If you gave the tenant power to sub-let, the landlord would have no interest in the capability of the tenant to whom he granted the lease of a farm. How is it possible for any Judge or legal authority, whether of the Superior or Inferior Courts to decide that the man who had been accepted as the sub-tenant is capable of thoroughly carrying on the business of any particular farm? I will give legal authority of high standing credit for knowing a great deal, but I
 189
 MR. C. W. GRAY : Who is the authority?
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George' s : I would appeal to my hon. Friend to withdraw his objection. This measure really constitutes the basis of the subject which has to be considered by the Committee. Its provisions in no way partake of the character of confiscation, but merely provide that by agreement or arbitration the Metropolitan Water undertakings may be purchased and a Water Trust formed to administer the water supply of London. It is generally understood that it is very desirable to have the whole question of the water supply considered by a Select Committee, and this Bill deals with the fundamental part of the question to be considered.
*(5.8.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : When first I came to consider this Bill I thought it was not one of those Bills which it would be well to refer to the Committee which is going to sit upon the whole question. But, upon further consideration and examination of the Bill, I came to the conclusion that, on the whole, it would be best that the Committee should have all the questions involved in what is known as the "London water question" before it when it comes to deliberate upon the subject. I entirely concur with what my hon. and gallant Friend has said with regard to the position of the Government and of the House in regard to the principle of the Bill. It is to be understood on the part of the Govern-

 *COLONEL HUGHES  (Woolwich) : I am acquainted with a case—that of the White Swan public house at Deptford—in which the leaseholder desired to sell his lease to a man who was a perfectly proper person to succeed him, but the freeholder objected to the transfer unless he were paid a fine of £100. The fine would not make the proposed tenant either better or worse, and it therefore appeared to me a great injustice. I have no doubt that is not a solitary case. Doubtless landlords frequently take advantage of their position and exact terms before giving consent to a transfer, which consent it seems to me ought to be given without any money consideration whatever. The proper way for a landlord who owns a house adjoining the one he lives in to protect himself is to let on an annual tenancy. I have a house which overlooks my own, and, in order to secure that I shall be free from annoyance, I let it on a monthly tenancy, and while the tenant is perfectly friendly of course the arrangement works quite smoothly, but should the disposition of the tenant change I shall have a right to turn him out at very short notice. It is in consequence of the law relating to covenants in leases being enforced with such rigour that landlords and the law have become obnoxious. Even good landlords suffer in reputation through the evil deeds done by others who exact the strict letter of the law. I have no doubt improvement might be made in some of the clauses of the Bill. It must be borne in mind that although the original lessee may sub-let or assign, he is always liable to the rent, and at the end of the lease to return the property in proper repair and according to covenant. The landlord has, in fact, a greater security rather than a less one if the lease has been assigned or sub-let. For all these reasons I think the Second Reading might be fairly
 188
 *MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : I may remind the hon. Gentleman that I said the majority of landowners were reasonable men.
*(2. 20.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : The hon. Gentleman (Mr. Rentoul) who moved the rejection of this Bill stated that he had not been able to meet with a single member of either branch of the legal profession who approved of the measure in its intirety. But the same thing might be said of pretty nearly every Bill which is brought in for the purpose of dealing with a difficult legal problem such as that with which this measure is intended to solve. Without committing myself by saying I approve of every word in the Bill, I may say that, in my opinion, there is nothing in it that could not be fairly dealt with on due examination in Committee, so that anything at all objectionable might be removed. I hope, therefore, the House will assent to its Second Reading. It seems to me that the vice of the arguments advanced against the Bill lies in this: that the hon. Members for East Down (Mr. Rentoul) and for Stockport (Mr. Gedge) both ignored the fact that this measure is an extension—and I think a legitimate and reasonable extension—of a principle that has been acted upon over and over again both by the Courts of Equity and the Legislature. Anyone familiar with the English Common Law must know that under it the position of the lessee is

*(4.17.)  SIR H. JAMES  (Bury, Lancashire) : I am not going to follow the Attorney General into a history of the Act of 1881. I would invite the House to approach this question as a matter of business, and to see whether they cannot put the law, when there is a grievance—as the Attorney General admits there is—on a better and surer foundation. We start with this principle—"That the law abhors a forfeiture," and every lawyer knows that in many cases of forfeiture the punishment is not a real measure of the injury. If this forfeiture is unjust, let us consider what is the remedy. I submit that this Bill offers a right remedy for a wrong punishment of forfeiture.

 *SIR H. JAMES : I am not answerable for what other Members have said; but that argument does not represent the contents of the Bill. As I have intimated, the Attorney General has ignored the fact that if there were such a state of things no Court of Equity would grant relief. If the lessor and lessee say, "We enter into a contract under these conditions, the house shall

 MR. WIGGIN  (Staffordshire, Handsworth) : I shall support the suggestion as to reading the Bill a second time, and sending it to the Committee if it is understood that the House is not committed thereby to the principle of the Bill.
*(1.16.)  MR. RENTOUL  (Down, E.) : I rise to move that this Bill be read a second time this day six months, and I do so because I myself have known many instances in the past in which this Bill, had it been law, would have worked the greatest hardship, and I think if hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the House will look carefully into this Bill they will have little hesitation in rejecting it. The Bill has been prepared and brought in by four gentlemen, all of them members of the legal profession, and all of them very fit to give a sound opinion on this subject. Therefore, the Bill is clearly not the offspring of any extreme faction, nor is it brought in for any Party
 148 149 150 statu quo, "Though the law will not allow the lessor to take advantage of the lessee by ejecting him for a breach of covenant, where no real harm has been done, neither will it and the lessee to force a tenant on the lessor when in fact he hag covenanted that he will attempt anything of the kind." 151 152 153 154 "Touch it not, a mother sat there; And a sacred thing is the old armchair." 155 156 157 158 v. v. v. v. 159
(4.27.)  MR. JAMES STUART rose in his place, and claimed to move, "That the Question be now put;" but Mr. SPEAKER withheld his assent, and declined then to put that Question.
(5.7.)  MR. J. STUART  (Shoreditch, Hoxton) : I hope my hon. Friend will withdraw that Motion as soon as possible, for it is only reasonable that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. The object of the Bill is to prevent the companies raising the value of their property just as it is about to be taken over by a Public Authority. It is far better that this matter should go to the Committee for examination, and I rejoice that the Government are willing thus to refer it.
(5.28.)  MR. J. R. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I believe the meter system has already been tried, and been found to be unworkable. I hold that under no circumstances ought the House to consent to the supply of water by meter, unless accompanied by a maximum charge per year; for if water is to be thus charged it is only natural that the poor should try and use as little as possible. The hon. Member for Darlington has fully shown that the Bill is in the interests of the rich, and to the disadvantage of the poor, and I hope the House will think twice before it adopts its principle. I am not known to be particularly friendly to the Water Companies, but I do not know upon what principle the cost should be thrown upon them of supplying a community of 5,000,000 with meters. These and other questions, however, are matters which
 199
(3.23.)  MR. J. R. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.)  I desire to say a few words in explanation of the vote I intend to give in favour of the Second Reading of the Bill. I think if the measure had been made to apply only to urban leaseholds, and not to mining leases, it might have secured much more general support. But I trust the Bill will go to a Committee, and that it will there be amended, if necessary. There is no force in the objection that has been taken that the Bill is retrospective, because the Act of 1881 was retrospective, and this is only an Amendment of that Act. I do not propose to deal with the sentimental considerations which the hon. and learned Member for East Down (Mr. Rentoul) has put before the House. I think the subject is far too important for us to be led astray by any consideration as to the private tastes and conveniences of the few persons who live in the suburbs. I was a little surprised to hear that the most solemn contract a man enters into in the whole course of his life is a contract for the lease of a house. I confess I have myself entered into others which I consider to be still more
 174
*(4.50.)  MR. CAUSTON  
(Southwark, W.) : I do not propose to detain the House more than a very few minutes while I explain the nature and object of the Bill, the Second Reading of which I rise to move. The object of the Bill is to prevent, at the present time, an increase of the water rates of the Metropolis by reason merely of the increase of the annual or rateable value that may be unconnected with water supply, and which may involve no commensurate increase in the consumption of water. We propose to declare that except for adequate reason the rate to be charged for the financial year shall not be increased because of a rise in the rateable value. I understand that Her Majesty's Government are willing to allow the Second Reading of the Bill, and that it shall be referred to a Committee if we on this side of the House are willing to allow the other Water Bills which appear on the Paper to receive similar treatment. I may say, on behalf of my London Liberal colleagues, that we shall gladly fall in with that view. But it is very important that this Bill should be referred to a Committee at once. London has been waiting a long time to have its water grievance settled, and now that we have a County Council, and that the water question has been raised on a Bill which has already been read a second time, and referred to a Hybrid Committee upstairs, appointed for the purpose of dealing with the whole question of handing over the control of the water supply to a public authority, we think that this is the time when we should endeavour to prevent the Water Companies raising their rates on the quinquennial revaluation which will come into opera-
 191 192
 MR. R. G. WEBSTER  (St. Pancras, E.) : I think the Bill ought not to leave the House without some discussion. It seems to me that the measure is one entirely in favour of the rich and of the wealthy tradesmen of London, and very detrimental to the interests of the working classes. In Berlin the system of measuring and charging for water by meter has been adopted, and it has been found necessary to employ an Inspector for every 400 meters. Therefore, if the system is adopted in London it will be necessary to appoint no fewer than 1,600 Inspectors. The Bill, moreover, while it compels the companies to go to the expense of £3,000,000 sterling in securing meters, provides no means by which to raise the money, and though it compels them to put meters in the various houses of London it imposes no obligation on the consumers to use them. Further, the Bill may necessitate land-
 197
*(1.52.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : I rise to second the Amendment. The hon. Member opposite (Mr. T. H. Bolton) was equally eloquent upon the enormous value of the property which has grown up in London and elsewhere under the existing laws, and upon the enormous benefits which this bantling of his is to confer on that class of property. It seems to me that if leasehold property is exposed to such great dangers that this Bill is necessary to remove them, it is a very remarkable thing that so much of it should have grown up. There may be some hard oases, but I would remind the House of the old proverb, "Hard cases make bad law." The principle of the existing law I think I may take from the hon. Member himself. He said very properly that forfeiture or re-entry is a means to an end—a security for the performance of a covenant. I understand my hon. Friend (Mr. T. H. Bolton) to admit that forfeiture ought to remain as a
 160
 *MR. SYDNEY GEDGE : I think the Court of Equity had given relief in such cases before any Statute was made. In regard to insurance, the Act of 22 & 23 Vict. enabled the Court of Equity to give relief provided an insurance was in force; but the relief could be given once only. In other cases relief can be given by forcing the tenant to pay damages. In this Bill you do not carry that principle further, but reverse it. You are going to give the tenant relief for a continued breach of covenant, and to leave the landlord altogether powerless. It must be remembered that a consideration has been directly given for the covenant in all these cases. The tenant who takes a lease, subject to no covenant at all, is always willing to pay a higher rent than if the lease is burdened with covenants. My hon. Friend (Mr. Rentoul) just now gave a case in which a man because of his personal character was able to obtain a lease at £ I an acre less than it would have been granted to a rival candidate. Would it be fair and equitable that under these circumstances the lessee should be at liberty to sell to the objectionable tenant the very lease he had obtained because of his own personal character? I think that would be neither equity nor justice. The Act we are proposing to amend was the outcome of a very full and long inquiry and consultation with the leading members of both branches of the legal profession. It was brought in in 1880 when there was not time to pass it. It was again introduced in 1881 under the

*(12.30.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I may explain that its object is to give additional security to leasehold property. I may remind the House that a lease is a contract granting the occupancy of a property for a definite time on the payment of rent provided that certain covenants and stipulations are performed, and giving the landlord upon non-payment of rent or non-performance of the covenants a right of re-entry and forfeiture of the lease. The right of re-entry is not intended to destroy or to defeat the lease, but is a final resort in case of a persistent and continuous breach of the covenants and the conditions of the lease. The

 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : The hon. Member will observe that I have followed the lines of the Act of 1881 and the language used there.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : No, I said that I, being a Metropolitan Member, left the Representatives of mining interests to express their opinion.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : There may be only one rent. It may be necessary to acquire or maintain the chief lease in order to support the under lease. In this respect we follow the precedent of the Bankruptcy Act.
 MR. HALSEY  (Herts, Watford) : I object.
 MR. HALSEY : I am exceedingly sorry; but I must persist in my objection.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (MR. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I wish, on behalf of the Government, to appeal to my hon. Friend not to persist in his objection. It is a matter of the highest importance, from the point of view of the Government, that this question should be examined in reference to every interest. Any delay that occurred in reading the
 200
*(3.31.)  MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN  (Merthyr Tydvil) : I desire to say a word from a mining point of view. Sub-section 6 of Section 14 of the Act of 1881 excludes, or rather prevents, relief being given in two cases: in the case of bankruptcy of the lessee, and in event of goods being taken in execution. As to the latter, I think the House has had full information; but in the other case, in reference to mining leases, I desire to mention a fact to the House. I had taken a mining lease and desired to have an extension, and I further desired to have a clause in the lease preventing the landlord from withholding consent to the assignment to a responsible person. For that I had to pay to the landlord on this mining lease, and simply to get a clause providing that he should not unreasonably withhold his consent, £100. Then there is the forfeiture of the mining lease in consequence of the refusal to permit inspection of the books or of the mine, and this is a provision most injurious in its character to the mining interest. In order to avoid being placed in the position of having their leases forfeited on the caprice of the landlord some mine owners are compelled to enter into contracts of the most injurious character to themselves. It may be that at some particular moment the lessee's manager may have refused to allow the landlord or a person in his employ to inspect the mine or books, and the lessee has to submit to most injurious conditions. Personally, I had, in one instance, to raise a dead rent of a mine from £200 a year and royalty on the product to £750 in order to avoid the forfeiture to which I should have been liable in consequence of refusal on the part of the manager to allow inspection. No possible injury could result to a lessor of a mine if a measure of the kind before the House were passed into law. He would be sufficiently protected, while the lessee would have relief from possible forfeiture as the result of carelessness or mistake on the part of a manager. For this reason I support the Bill.
*(3.35.)  MR. TOMLINSON  (Preston) : I have found some difficulty in making
 176 177
 *MR. TOMLINSON : With reference to assignment, I think it is generally the fault of the lessee if he does not see that the covenant is properly limited; and I do not like to contemplate a state of things under which the lessee and the lessor in mining contracts would not be free to make their own bargains for themselves. Seeing, therefore, that the promoters of the Bill are so little agreed as to the form which it should assume, and as it tends to disturb a settlement of the question which, on the whole, has worked well, I oppose the Second Reading.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I want to point out to the hon. Member exactly what would happen. The onus of proof rests on the man who departs from the covenant; and unless he makes out a case of real hardship in not being permitted to do a certain thing, of course the Court would not grant his application. The Court would, in the first instance, presume in favour of the terms of the covenant. A man might come to the Court and say, "I want to put A in my place." The landlord might say, "No; I disapprove of A, and I will not have him." Does anybody think for one moment that the Court of Equity would interfere in such circumstances? On the other hand, there might arise certain exceptional circumstances of hardship, which this Bill provides for—where a tenant, for example, had died, and the lease had descended to his widow. She might have found some one able and willing to conduct the farm, and it would be a hardship if an assignment were refused to her by a perverse landlord. It would be a proper thing for the Court to consider whether or not a hardship was imposed on the tenant in such a case. No such state of circumstances as has been referred to by the hon. Member could arise under the Bill, and the hon. Member is evidently going to vote
 190
(3.35.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I had no intention of taking part in this Debate, and would not have risen but that I think the hon. Member who has last spoken is under a misapprehension as to the scope and operation of the Bill. It is admitted that if by the operation of this Bill an incompetent tenant were to be forced on the landlord in place of a tenant whom he could trust, there would be an end to it. Under this Bill the authority has power to grant relief.
*(2.44.)  MR. MORTON  
(Peterborough) : We know that owing to the mere caprice of landlords cases of hardship do frequently occur, and I may mention a case such as is not uncommon in London. I am sure the Attorney General will be glad to hear that this comes to me from a respectable firm of solicitors who are good Conservatives, and therefore not likely to exaggerate the facts from political bias. The case I speak of relates to property in the Strand. D took a lease for 12 years, the original landlord being the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and a few months back he desired to let

*(2.42.)  MR. KIMBER  (Wandsworth) : It is due to the House, as my name is on the back of the Bill, that I should state the reasons for the faith that is in me.

 SIR H. DAVEY  (Stockton) : That is under the Statute.
(5.18.)  MR. BLUNDELL MAPLE  (Camberwell, Dulwich) : I beg to move that this Bill be read a second time with the object of referring it to the Select Committee.
(3.58.)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : I was anxious to hear the views of the hon. and learned Member for Stockton; I wondered whether my hon. and learned Friend would support the Bill on all the grounds which have been advanced for its Second Reading; and I am a little surprised to find my hon. and learned Friend had gone so far as he has, though I admit he has reserved freedom to qualify some of the proposals in the Bill we are now asked to read a second time. But I am here to oppose the Bill as we have it before us—not a Bill such as this might be made to be, but the Bill as it is. Members who have spoken have said they would be prepared to support the Bill limited to houses in London or to urban property, but that is not the Bill introduced. This is a Bill, as the hon. Member for St. Pancras frankly acknowledged in introducing it, which proposes to deal with leasehold property wherever situated in town or country, and I address myself to the proposals in the Bill. I was anxious to know whether my hon and learned Friend (Sir Horace Davey)

 SIR R. WEBSTER : The cases with which this Bill deals are cases in which the landlord could not be put back in the same position. If the hon. Member had read the Bill and mastered its contents, he would have seen that his vote ought to have been against it, just as his speech was against it. There are two cases which are of importance. In the first place, if the lessee has signed away the property, it is impossible to put the lessor back into the same position if it is to be assumed that the assignment will stand. The other case is one of bankruptcy. How the lessor is to come back in the same position if the lessee he has chosen becomes bankrupt I cannot imagine. I think the Bill has been framed with reference to cases in which no doubt there may be grievances, but it does not afford any proper remedy for those grievances. In all probability it would, if passed, create far greater evils than now exist, and would not redress the evils for which gentlemen on the other side desire to provide a remedy. It is not because I am disinclined or adverse to dealing with these evils, but because it seems to me that the Bill overlooks altogether the principle of the Act of 1881, and that to amend it in Committee would lead to hopeless confusion, that I cannot recommend the House to agree to the Motion for the Second Reading.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Then this is of the essence of the Bill, and is not a slip in the drafting. It makes my objection to the 4th clause all the better founded, because it proposes to give the under lessee the right of putting himself in as the tenant of the whole property, although previously he may only have had the tenancy or occupation of one small room. That seems to me a very startling proposal, and one which, as I have seen no cases given in support of it, it is impossible to justify on principle. The hon. Member for St. Pancras has, to a great extent, relied upon the case of "Barrow  v. v. v.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : It has been contended by several speakers that the Court should have regard to the solvency of the tenant and nothing else.
(4 49.)  MR. THEODORE FRY  (Darlington) : I do not rise to discuss this question in the interests of the Metropolitan constituencies, among whom it is not so popular as has been represented in some quarters; but as I have the honour to represent a large body of provincial Water Companies, which

(5.21.)  MR. THEODORE FRY : I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time this day six months. It is admitted by the hon. Member opposite to be bad in principle, and it ought not to be sent to a Select Committee. The Bill is eminently one in favour of the rich as against the poor. What will be really the effect of a measure of this kind? Many of the wealthy houses in London are shut up for several months in the year, during which time little or no water is used in them; and if a system of payment by meter is adopted, the charge upon the owners of such houses as these will be comparatively small. A rich man, who is an hon. Member of this House, to day told me that he had refused to be put on the Committee to consider this question, because the result of such a Bill as this would be to put so much money in his pocket, that he felt that he could not fairly support it. This fact alone shows how much the Bill is in the interest of the rich. If the Water Companies lose money by the metre system in consequence of the closing of the houses of the wealthy during a certain season of the year, they will be obliged, in order to secure their income and pay their dividend, to make a heavier charge on the masses of the community and the poor. There can be no doubt that if water is charged by meter the price will have to be very much larger than is paid at the present time, and there will be a constant endeavour to limit its use in order to escape charge. For instance, in No. 44 meter district, Cornwall Road, Brixton Hill, the water rate is now on the average £1 3s. 9d. per house per annum, but if the charge is by meter system at the rate of 1s. per 1,000 gallons, the rate will be increased to about £2 16s. 2d. per annum. In these circumstances, the water rate will be enormously increased on the poor if the companies are allowed to charge by meter. Further than that, the Bill would tend to limit the use
 198
 COLONEL MAKINS  (Essex, S. E.) : I have only risen to say that the arrangement mentioned by the hon. Member (Mr. Causton) is one which I am prepared to adopt; but I only make this statement on the understanding that, by allowing the Bill to be read a second time, we shall not thereby be committing the House to the principle of the measure. We only assent to the Second Reading  pro formâ
 MR. CHAINING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture when the Bill which he has in preparation for the prevention of adulteration of artificial manures and feeding stuffs will be introduced and put down for Second Reading; and whether, having regard to the fact that the principle of the Artificial Manures, &c. (Adulteration) Bill, now before the House, has been accepted in the resolutions passed by all the Chambers of Agriculture which have up to this date considered that Bill, by the Chemical Manure Manufacturers' Association, by the Incorporated Oil Seed Association, and by other corporate bodies interested in this question, and has received the unanimous approval of the agricultural Press, he proposes to embody in his own Bill the principle thus approved?
 MR. JOHN WILSON  (Lanark) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether, in the case of vessels built in the United Kingdom to the order and delivery of foreigners, their values are not included in the Board of Trade Export Returns; and whether, seeing such vessels are built and equipped by material and labour, the product of this country, and thus form an essential part of export trade, he will consider the propriety of including such vessels in the Returns, or at least of appending their value to the Returns?
 MR. CONTBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the Secretary of State has yet ascertained whether any Papers relating to the cost of civil justice in India can usefully be published; and if the Inquiry promised in June 1890 has resulted in the finding of such Papers, whether they will be placed in the hands of hon. Members?
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to answer this question. I have not seen the evidence, but I will communicate with the Attorney General for Ireland, and if I find that the evidence is sufficient to warrant a prosecution I will take that step.
 MR. J. MORLEY : What is to be the business next week?
 MR. J. MORLEY : What Supply?
 MR. STORET : Colonel White was not there.
 THE CHAIRMAN : There is now no Amendment before the Committee.
*(9.29.)  COLONEL BLITNDELL  (Lancashire, S.W., Ince) : Every military man who heard the statement made by the Government at the time of General Grenfell's action, that we were to hold Suakin by itself, knew that it was a dangerous statement to make, because there is no such thing as a passive defence. Any General defending Suakin ought to have full liberty to hold a certain zone of the territory around it, so that an enemy should not be allowed to come up to it at all. Pull liberty should be allowed to the commanding officer defending Suakin to occupy and hold the country near, in order to secure that town from attack by an enemy.
 THE CHAIRMAN : I do not see the relevancy of this at all.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The hon. Member did not understand the argument of the hon. Member for Sunderland. The hon. Member for Sunderland suggested motives for the present position in Egypt.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : This is far too remote from the subject now before the Committee.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : Did the hon. Member hear the question put?
 THE CHAIRMAN : Then the hon. Member ought to have voted.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order order! That line of argument is not relevant to the Motion.
 MR. CHAIRMAN : Order, order! I have already told the hon. Member he is speaking irrelevantly. I must now warn him of the consequences which will ensue if he persists in that conduct.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : That Amendment was withdrawn.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Yes, it was.
 MR. CHAINING : I hope the hon. Member will not persist in his objection. The Bill is a very useful one.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co. Mid) : I object.
 DR. TANNER : But may I ask whether the Question was withdrawn by the Chair?
(11.58.) DR. TANNER : I think that insufficient attention has been paid to the point raised by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy. The hon. Member drew attention to the fact that while certain colonies pay towards the cost of troops employed within their borders, there are several colonies who contribute nothing to such cost. If we are to be fair all round, the Government ought certainly to take into consideration the fact that there are colonies who do not pay any thing towards the troops. We ought to have some distinct assurance from the Government that no invidious distinction will be made between——
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : May I call the attention to the fact that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy made a Motion proposing to reduce the Vote by £50,000, and it was to that Motion I was speaking at 12 o'clock?
(11.15.)  DR. TANNER : I hope the Government will take to heart the interesting lesson they have received tonight. We have had  dilettanti
(9.30.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : This is a short but expressive statement from a supporter of the Government. But we may ask where, in the name of common sense, is this region of attack to end. We were told not so long ago by Her Majesty's Government that the occupation of Egypt is to continue to a remote period. Then again we are told that the possession of Suakin is indispensable as part of our policy. It is of no practical use to England as a military station, but our holding it or Egypt holding it constitutes a sort of sore on the surface of that part of the world, it provokes irritation among the natives; and how long is this to continue? We are to have an extension of telegraphic communication, and other expenses are to be incurred in connection with a district which is of no good to the
 319
(8.5.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I wish to say a few words in supporting the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton. In so doing I would remind the House that there is a certain sum of £250,000 charged on the British taxpayer for the Army of Occupation in Egypt; but I was told by the Secretary for War that in reality the British taxpayer paid nothing at all for that Army of Occupation. He said we required a certain number of troops, and that whether they were in Cork or Edinburgh, Aldershot or Egypt, made no difference. We required the men, and must support them wherever they were, so that if we kept them in Egypt we had only to pay for them there as we should have to do if they were maintained anywhere else. This would have been a good reply had it been accurate; but I doubt its accuracy. For instance, I find that in three of our Crown Colonies, the Mauritius, Ceylon and the Straits Settlement, we have about the same number of men that we have in Egypt, so that if this theory were sound

 DR. CLARK : Am I to understand that the sole garrison will be the garrison we maintain for Imperial purposes at Simon's Bay, and that the entire cost of all the men required in Natal will be defrayed by Natal?
 DR. CLARK : But we cannot discuss the matter upon a question.
 DR. CLARK : I notice there has been a reduction in the agency charges——
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : I have not heard of any complaints made by the fishermen in the neighbourhood of Castletown, Berehaven, of depredations by French fishermen. There are at present two sailing cruisers at Bantry, and they will shortly be re-inforced by a steam cruiser. The services of all these vessels will be available, if required, to maintain order.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : No Report on this subject has been received, either by the Admiralty or by the Irish Government.
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : The unexpended balance at the close of 1889–90 under the head of "New Construction under the Naval Defence Act of 1889," for which provision was made in the Navy Votes, was—for materials and contract work (Vote 8, Sections 1, 2, and 3), £174,243. No portion of this sum has been expended during the present financial year.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : I believe that the fact stated in the question is correct. The matter came at the time before the Local Government Board, who sent a warning to the Guardians.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Every effort is made to secure that persons in absosolute need of relief, and that they alone, are employed upon relief works. The employment lists are revised from time to time, and the cases of all applicants receive careful consideration.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : There are four relief works in Achill Island, giving employment on February 28th to 317 persons. Should it be deemed necessary to open further relief works on the Island, or to afford employment to a larger number of persons, the matter will, of course, be carefully considered. The Poor Law Guardians of Westport Union estimated that the quantity of seed potatoes required for Achill Electoral Division would be 58 tons 18 cwt., and that the number of occupiers requiring seed would be 172, giving an average of
 253
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : That is not so easy a matter as the hon. Gentleman seems to imagine. I am carefully watching in order to see whether it is necessary to set additional relief works going.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The position of this Union is engaging the attention of the Government.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am informed that, previous to the hearing of the case, the gentleman mentioned had been sitting as a Magistrate on the Bench; and, after giving evidence, he resumed his seat there. He has, however, assured the Lord Chancellor that he had no intention of taking part in the adjudication, and that, in fact, when the case was called on, he stated in open Court that he would not adjudicate upon it. No allegation, either as to deafness or as to inconvenience to litigants, has been made to the Lord Chancellor in reference to this gentleman.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I must ask the hon. Gentleman to put down the question for a later day.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The condition of the locality mentioned is receiving the careful attention of the Government.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have no information which would enable me to answer this question.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have suggested that there shall be a Joint Committee or some analogous body, and in the deliberation of which representatives, both of the Corporation and the Prison Board, shall take part to consider this difficult question. I am in hopes that this plan may lead to a satisfactory settlement of the matter.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Constabulary authorities report that no additional cost is incurred in the matter referred to. The landlord provides house accommodation and other requisites free of charge.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The woman referred to was summoned at the time for being one of a disorderly crowd which stoned the police in December, 1889.
 259
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The West Coast of Donegal has caused considerable anxiety to the Government, and its condition is being carefully watched. It has not, so far, been found necessary to start relief works in the district of Anagry.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It is the case that there is poverty among the helpless families in Lower Templecrone. Their eases are under consideration.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. Member appears to be under a misapprehension in supposing that any general desire has been expressed by the
 255
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The only collision between a tramcar in Belfast and another vehicle, which has come under the notice of the police, occurred in Royal Avenue. The matter subsequently came before the Recorder on appeal, who acquitted the tramway officials of all blame. The other case to which my hon. Friend refers is probably that of a schoolboy, who was run over by a passing tramcar when jumping off the foot of another tramcar, on which he had been riding surreptitiously. The coroner's jury found the death to be accidental. I have no doubt the Local Authority give due attention to all such cases that come before them.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am informed that some pawnbrokers in Belfast have adopted the practice referred to in the question. The police have made efforts to obtain sufficient grounds for a prosecution, but hitherto without success. I shall, however, consider what further steps should be taken.
 MR. PICKARD  (York, W.R., Norman ton) : I beg to ask the Attorney General, whether his attention has been called to the case of "Frances Bennett  v Sheffield Independent
 MR. CONYBEARE : I am not quite satisfied by the answer of the right hon. Gentleman whether any steps are being taken by the Indian Government to prevent the evils complained of.
 MR. CONYBEARE : Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether definite information may be shortly expected?
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the Secretary of State will direct the Government of Bombay to so amend the new Bombay Salt Act that it shall not be possible for such acts as the boiling of water containing salt, duly purchased, accidentally spilled therein, or the boiling down of dirty salt, bought openly in the bazaar, to purify it, to be described as the "manufacture" of salt, rendering parties doing these things liable to punishment; (2) whether a recent judgment of the High Court of Bombay, while holding the punishment inflicted for the offences described above was excessive, and that the sentences should be nominal only, yet held that they were offences under the Act, punishable with fine and imprisonment; (3) whether, in legislation relating to the Government, salt monopoly in India prior to the Bombay Act of 1890, similar provisions were contained; and (4) whether in other parts of the Empire Salt Acts contain like clauses; and, if not, why such provisions should be required for Bombay?
(11.36.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I think the apprehensions of my hon. Friend are somewhat exaggerated. I do not imagine that when the troops are removed from Pietermaritzburg there will be any greater danger to the white population of Natal than there is at the present time. I have every reason to believe that responsible Government in Natal will be quite competent to look after itself and not involve itself in complications either with the population of Natal or the population of Zululand. And if they do, I am not aware it will be incumbent upon us to send out troops there any more than we are in the habit of sending out troops in the case of disturbance
 336
(12.21.)  MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I think the right hon. Gentleman has said quite enough to justify opposition to the Bill by hon. Members on this side. The right hon. Gentleman brings down a Bill to effect important changes in the constitution of the country, and simply throws it at our heads saying "If you do not choose to accept the whole Bill as we present it we shall withdraw it, and you shall not have whatever benefit it may contain." The Bill has passed through Committee simply  pro formâ
 MR. CONYBEARE : The question has been raised in regard to Government and other Bills, whether the Third Reading can be taken after a Bill has been amended. I remember last Session we had an all-night Sitting——
 MR. CONYBEARE : Certainly, Sir; I bow to your ruling. But it cannot be denied that we had no satisfactory assurance from the Government. Cannot the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs do away with the necessity for further discussion by giving us the answer we require? Our demand has been met as usual with a Closure Motion. We want the Government, however, to closure the forward movement in the Soudan. Complaint is made that we have been wasting time. I do not think that charge can fairly be made against me. I have been in Egypt and done something to make myself acquainted with the issues involved in this question, and I might justly have asked the indulgence of the House in order to raise certain points. Having regard to the immense importance of this matter from
 333
 MR. CONYBEARE : I was only employing it for purposes of illustration. The right hon. Gentleman is always willing to criticise the action of his former colleagues; but I had hoped he would have helped us in getting an answer from the Government. It will, no doubt, be in his recollection——
 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Cambourne) : Mr. Courtney, I have to state that by accident I have been excluded from voting. I was in the Lobby at the time of the Division writing a letter, and my vote was not recorded.
(11.4.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I may give another reason which justifies the action of my hon. Friend. The responsible chiefs of the Party which sit on this side of the House have in no way assisted us in our attempts to get satisfactory assurances from the Government. I have noticed a lamentable absence and ominous silence on this question on the part of those who usually occupy the Front Opposition Bench. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham is smiling in unusual fashion. He has been enjoying——
 MR. CONYBEARE : Yes, Sir.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I would point out to the hon. Member that the Bill is not compulsory.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I wish it to be understood that what I said has reference to Amendments on the Paper which are of a fundamental character; embracing, as they do, alterations in the franchise, they are not simply Amendments dealing with the machinery of registration with which we ask the House to deal. To Amendments of that character of course my remarks do not apply. The Amendments I refer to are those which strike at the very root of the Bill which we have introduced at the earnest request of County Councils. It is a pure machinery Bill and we are not prepared to ask the House to embark on the discussion of franchise questions.
*(12.24.)  MR. RITCHIE : I want the Committee to understand that the Government must not be supposed to be acting with the slightest disrespect towards Members of the House if they do not proceed with the Bill. I on a previous occasion explained our deeply-rooted objections to changing the whole character of the Bill in the manner I have indicated. The position we take is this: If this change is to be made it must be made in sufficient time in order to allow anyone who has anything to do with the working of the Registration Law to make himself acquainted with the change. The Government do not think they would be justified in pushing forward the Bill if it could only come into operation at a time when possibly those charged with the administration would not be fully acquainted with the change. If the Bill does not pass we shall do all we can without it to assist those who are charged with the duty of making up the register, in the performance of their duties within the time and in the best manner possible.
 *MR. RITCHIE : But the hon. Member cannot object to my making a statement? I desire to say that the Government do not think they would be justified in keeping this Bill on the Paper and allowing the matter to remain in a state of uncertainty. It is undesirable that those who are engaged in the duties of registration should have any doubt as to those duties and the time in which they must perform them. We had hoped that this Bill would have been accepted generally' by the House when we introduced it at the desire of County Councils, but I have been in communication with hon. Gentlemen opposite who have Amendments on the Paper, and from who I am told I fear there is very little probability of their withdrawing their opposition and Amendments. I propose to put the Bill down for Monday, in the hope that hon. Gentlemen who have notices of Amendments to entirely alter the character of the Bill, will meanwhile reconsider the position. But I think it my duty to put an end to uncertainty, and if on Monday hon. Members cannot see their way to withdraw the Amendments to which I refer, and if they are not prepared to accept the Bill practically in the form in which it is now reprinted, it will be my duty to move the discharge of the order.
*(12.20.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : This Bill has now been amended  fro formâ
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : I do not understand that in the case of the Hyde cemetery, to which the hon.

The proposal that was submitted at the inquiry was that three chapels should be erected—one for the Church of England, one for Nonconformists, and one for Roman

 MR. MADDEN : It would be contrary to precedent.

 MR. KNOX : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether the Government will consent to the Motion for a Return, Justices of the Peace (County Cavan), which is on the Paper for this day?
 MR. KNOX : Why does the right hon. Gentleman refuse to give the rateable value?
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of the Treasury whether the Treasury refuse to allow loans to Town Commissioners in Ireland for public improvements to be made on the same terms, namely, the repayment of principal and interest by an annuity, as loans to landlords and farmers for private improvements; and, if so, for what reason?
 MR. DE COBAIN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some persons engaged in the pawn broking trade in Belfast had adopted the practice of discounting Army Pension Papers, though such Papers distinctly indicated the illegality of such a course; and whether he would give instructions to the Royal Irish Constabulary to test the validity of these charges, and to take such steps against those who might be found guilty of the offence as would check the recurrence of such a practice?
 MR. DE COBAIN  (Belfast, E.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if his attention has been drawn to a serious collision in Donegall Street, Belfast, between a tramcar and another vehicle at the narrow part of the street where the provisions of the Act of Parliament had been infringed in the laying of the tram lines, and, as loss of life had quite recently taken place at the same point, would he impress upon the Local Authority the necessity for securing greater safety for the ordinary traffic of the city at this and other equally dangerous points?
 MR. DE COBAIN : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he is aware that complaints have been made by suitors and the public generally in regard to the delay on the part of the officials of the different Courts connected with the Pour Courts, Dublin, in making up the orders and decrees given by the different Judges, almost a month, and sometimes even two months, elapsing in getting out the order; whether the different Law Societies have repeatedly complained of such delays; and, whether, in view of the fact that the hours of attendance at the Four Courts are from 11.30 to 3.30, whereas in London the Judges sit from 10.30 to 4.30, some steps will be taken at an early date to ensure the greater despatch of business at these Courts, in the interest of the professional gentlemen practising there and of the public at large?
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the cost of magazine rifles made by contract is correctly stated in the letter from the War Office to the Under Secretary for India, dated 27th June, 1890, namely—
 249 "The full price of the rifle is £5 12s. 6d., made up as follows: contract price, £5 9s.; butt and fore end (supplied to the contractors free by the War Office), 10½d. and 1s. 7½d. respectively; cost of extra view of certain components by War Office during manufacture of rifle, 1s.; total, £5 12s. 6d. (Note.—The original contract price was £5 10s., it was reduced to £5 9s. on account of extra view.) Accordingly, the total price payable by you for each rifle is £5 12s. 6d., as follows: to the Company, £2 14s. 6d.; to the War Office, £2 18s.; total, £5 12s. 6d; "
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has any information with regard to an attack made by pirates (who were on board the ship as passengers) on or about 1st December, 1890, on a steamer voyaging from Hong Kong to Swatow, in which a passenger named Petersen and the Captain (Captain Pocock) were killed, and property to the value of £5,000 was taken by the pirates, who escaped from the ship by boats; and what steps have been taken to bring the perpetrators of this outrage to punishment?
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : No decision has yet been come to as to the return from Bermuda of the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards. Whenever they are moved the cost will fall upon the Transport Vote.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : No doubt, Sir, that was absolutely true at that time.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : At the time the grant was fixed at 12s., it was supposed that that sum would fairly provide the articles of equipment in which Volunteers were usually deficient. It is found, however, that the demand for such large supplies in a short period has had the effect of inflating prices. I am further considering as to the date when the equipment must be complete. I shall be glad if my hon. Friend will repeat his question a short time hence.
 *MR E. STANHOPE : I have seen the statement referred to, and I am given to understand that it will shortly be the subject of a civil action; and I must therefore, in common fairness to all parties concerned, respectfully decline to make any observations whatever upon the case.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The hon. Member is only to understand what I said.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : The position of the labourers employed under the War Office was fully considered by the Government at the same time as that of those employed in the Dockyards. We came to the conclusion that no general case was made out for increasing the pay of labourers in the Ordnance Factories. But as regards the unskilled labourers in the employment of the Army Ordnance Store Department, we propose to follow generally at Woolwich, Portsmouth, Devonport, and Chatham the lines recently announced in the Circular from the Admiralty.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The prices at that time are accurately stated in the Question; but since the letter in which they occur was written, some small savings have been effected as regards parts of the magazine rifle. The last balance sheet of the Ordnance Factories shows the cost of sword bayonets as 12s., and of scabbards as 3s. 8d., but it is believed that the two together are now made for about 14s. 3d.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The answer to the first question is "Yes." I have already approved a Circular, which will be issued to contractors, which lays down rules as to sub-letting and as to wages, in full accordance with the terms of the Resolution adopted by the House of Commons.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : There are at present 2,449 non-commissioned officers and men of the Foot Guards stationed in London, of whom 324 are detailed for guard duties. The sentries at public buildings are not posted for purely military purposes.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : The hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Hanbury) is going to raise the question in the form of a question. We shall then have an opportunity of explaining what we propose to do with regard to agents.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I am afraid I cannot answer the question of the hon. Baronet. Personally I am very anxious to withdraw the troops from Natal at as early a date as possible, consistent with the material interests of Natal. It is better the troops should be concentrated as far as possible in the Cape Colony, but looking to the present condition of Natal and the districts bordering on Natal I cannot fix a date for the withdrawal of the troops.
(10.54.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : I had no intention to show any want of courtesy towards the hon. Baronet in not answering his question. I have not answered it for the simple reason that if the hon. Baronet had only listened to the Debate which took place on the last occasion when the House discussed this subject, he would have known that his question had already been answered. The question of Egypt was discussed on the last occasion
 330
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I have not said anything of the kind. The Departmental Committee will presently consider the case of the Cape.
(11.34.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : An opportunity for discussion will be given in the Colonial Vote: certainly the question does not arise in the Army Estimates.
(11.30.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : I think the hon. Gentleman might have had his desire gratified by simply asking a question. For the last two years we have had a Departmental Committee sitting. That Committee has been composed of representatives of the War Office, the Colonial Office, and the Treasury, and has already called upon certain colonies to pay increased sums towards the cost of troops who are maintained in those colonies. The question of the Cape has not been approached yet, but as to Natal our hope is that there shall be no military force permanently maintained there. We have had troublous times in Zululand, and we have not deemed it right to remove the troops.
(8.15.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : The hon. Member has put to me several questions and it is only right I should rise to answer them. His first question was, "Why should we pay the whole cost of the Army when we make some of the Crown Colonies pay the whole cost of the troops maintained in those Colonies"? The answer is perfectly clear. If we left Egypt the 3,000 troops we maintain there would not be disbanded; we should use them for our general purposes. At present, in Egypt, we are only carrying on from hand to mouth, believing that the time will come when we will be able to withdraw the troops for the general purposes of the country. When you come to the Crown Colonies the case is altogether different. We actually raise troops for the purpose of defending those colonies; they appear on the Army Estimates, and we get the money from the Colonial Government. Where we garrison distant coaling stations, it is difficult to call upon those colonies to pay the whole cost, but as much as they can afford. The cases are wholly different, and there is no analogy between them. The hon. Member asks what we propose to do with regard to Tokar. There is not the smallest suggestion of making a railway there. We have yielded to the strong representation of
 312
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I never said that. I said we should leave them free to give attention to their own frontiers.
(9.40.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : I hope we may now be allowed to come to a decision, for it is clear we are discussing over again exactly the question that was discussed at the last sitting on the Army Estimates. I have this evening again answered the observations of the hon. Member for Northampton, who, however, did not do me the favour of remaining in the House to hear my reply.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : Then we have had a speech from the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Sir G. Campbell), who never fails to give us the benefit of his views on this subject. No one can deny that the speeches of to-night have been the a  réchauffé
 MR. E. STANHOPE : No.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : Oh!
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I will give the hon. Gentleman the exact figures, as I know he loves accuracy above all things. On August 1, 1886, the number of troops in Egypt was 9,113, that being a considerable reduction from the beginning of the year.
 COLONEL HUGHES  (Woolwich) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War the decision as to the Petition of certain labourers in Woolwich Arsenal for increase of wages on account of heavy rents in London?
 *MR. CHANNING : I beg to give notice that if the Bill of the right hon. Gentleman does not embody the principle of some sufficient guaranteed analysis with penalties for misrepresentation, I shall move, on the Second Beading of the Bill, that the Bill, together with my own, be referred to a Select Committee, and, if the necessity arises, I shall oppose the Second Beading of the Government measure.
 *MR. CHANNING : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of any agricultural body which has expressed anything but a general approval of this Bill?
 MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : May I ask whether there is any intention on the part of the Government to attempt to proceed to-night with the Electors' Registration (Acceleration) Bill.
(11.50.)  MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S.E.) : I desire to call the attention of the Secretary for War to a matter which may have his cognisance, but which I am sure has not his approval. Large Government works are under construction at Shoeburyness. They are under the control of the Engineer Department, and that Department have made a practice for several years of turning off old soldiers when work is scarce elsewhere, and they can get the young fellows from the brickfields in the neighbourhood. I do not say that old soldiers because they are old soldiers should have a preference, but I think that old soldiers when once they are employed on work in garrison towns should not be sent about their business at a moment's notice without any reason whatever. The Secretary of State for War has frequently expressed his interest in the employment of Reserve and discharged soldiers; he has now a practical opportunity of showing such interest and of preventing the continuance of a practice which creates much dissatisfaction amongst very respectable old soldiers who now live in and about garrison towns.
 MR. GOSCHEN : In order to obtain the concession granted by the Act of last Session, lodging house keepers were required to have their names registered before July I last, a date subsequently extended to August 31, in order that ample notice might be given of the requirements of the law. It would be impossible to make any concession now in favour of those who, under these circumstances, failed to comply with the conditions demanded by the law. But, of course, they will be able to secure the benefits of the lower charge in future by registering themselves each year within the proper time.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I think not, Sir. I think it is very improbable.
 MR. LEVESON-GOWER : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether it be the fact that, although, according to Consul
 231
 MR. LEVESON-GOWER  (Stoke-upon-Trent) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can give the House any recent information as to the condition of Crete, and as to the correctness of the report that disturbances have again broken out in that Island, and that, among other cases of outrage, two lads have been lately murdered and mutilated by Zaptiehs?
 MR. LEVESON-GOWER : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government have any ground for believing that Moussa Bey is to be tried on any of the charges still pending against him; whether there is any prospect of his being exiled to Medina or elsewhere; and whether he is at present at Constantinople in actual or nominal confinement, or has been permitted to return to Armenia?
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty what was the amount of the unexpended balance of the Dockyard and Store Votes of the year 1889–90 applicable to the Naval Defence Fund under "The Naval Defence Act, 1889 "; and whether any portion of this has been expended in the year 1890–91?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I wish, Mr. Speaker, to raise a question of Privilege. I desire to call the attention of the House to the fact that I, as a Member of this House, was libelled yesterday by the chief editor or someone in the office of a daily print called the  Daily News 267 "At a late hour on Monday night Mr. Atkinson moved the House into Committee on his Marriage of Nonconformists (Attendance of Registrars) Bill. This was contrary to an understanding that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. The only way out of the difficulty in which the House now finds itself is that the Bill shall pass through Committee  pro formâ 268
 MR. BROADHURST  (Nottingham, W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Hame Department whether he has taken, or will take, any steps in conjunction with the Treasury to increase the present staff of Factory and Workshop Inspectors?
 *MR. CHAPLIN : In the communications which I have received some of the Agricultural Associations and Chambers have not expressed an entire approval of the Bill.
 MR. CHAPLIN : I do not think that I shall be able to introduce this Bill until after Easter. With regard to the Second Reading, the hon. Member must be aware that it is impossible for me to make any statements on that point at present. In reply to the second part of the question, I may say that I am in daily receipt of numerous communications on this subject, and they hardly lead me to the conclusion that the hon. Gentleman's Bill meets with the universal approval which he appears to suppose. I am, however, entirely in accord with the hon. Gentleman in the objects which he has in view, and I hope it may be possible to devise a measure which will be considered as acceptable by each of the two Parties who are so greatly interested in the question. With regard to the last question which the hon. Member has put to me, he will have ample opportunity of informing himself as to the principle of the Bill in question
 243
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : Yes; the Report of the Committee in question will be laid upon the Table, and I hope it will be ready shortly after Easter.
 MR. COBB : Am I, then, to understand that whenever circumstances which may have involved a breach of the Army Regulations are to be brought before the ordinary Courts of Law, the consideration of the question as to the breach of the regulations is to be postponed?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will ascertain from the Coroner for Westminster, and state if, in the oath which under the Act of Parliament he administered to the jurors at the inquest, the late Duke of Bedford was described, consistently with the warrant and jury snmmons, as "F. Russell," or as "Francis Charles Hastings Russell," or if he was described, inconsistently
 236
 MR. COBB : I beg to postpone the question of which I have given notice,
 235
 MR. COBB : Did I not understand the right hon. Gentleman to say last year that there had been no extra expense incurred?
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether his attention has been called to a statement publicly made in
 232
 *MR. COBB : May I ask what names were given? There have been several names mentioned in this case.
 MR. HARRISON  (Tipperary, Mid) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that there is acute distress in the parish of Gartan, County Donegal; and, whether he intends to take any steps to alleviate it?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he has any statistics showing the amount of interest requisite to pay the mortgages existing on Irish agricultural land, the average rate of interest charged for these mortgages, and the amount of the annuities charged on agricultural land in Ireland which are paid by the owners of the land; and, if so, whether he can present this information to the House?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Yes; but I think then there were certain military operations in progress.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I understand that the right hon. Gentleman disagrees with me, and believes there were many more men in Egypt then than now. But if he will take the average from two years, say, after the battle of Tel-el-Kebir up to the time when the late Government left office, and not taking into account periods when active military operations were going on, he will find that the number was considerably less than 12,000, and not probably more than the present number.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Well, they were still hanging on at Suakin. But I will not quarrel about the figures. The reason why troops were kept in Egypt after Tel-el-Kebir was because we were
 299 300 "I notice in your Despatch that you enolosea a telegram from General Hicks to Sir E. Malet on the subject of the military operations of the Soudan. It is unnecessary for me to repeat that Her Majesty's Government are in no way responsible for the operations in the Soudan, which had been undertaken under the authority of the Egyptian Government, or for the appointment or action of General Hicks." 301 "His Highness the Khedive said that he accepted cordially the policy of the abandonment of the whole of the Soudan." "We imposed a veto upon any attempt to re-conquer the Soudan, and when the Ministry of Cherif Pasha, after a period of hesitation,
 302 "About Tokar and Sinkat you can do nothing, except by proclaiming that the chiefs of tribes should come to Khartoum to Assembly of Notables, when the independence of the Soudan will he proclaimed." "General Graham has been directed not to undertake any operations at a considerable distance from Suakin. It is believed that the force under the command of Osman Digna is at a spot about 10 miles from Suakin. The force which General Graham found in position at El Teb was encamped at no distance from, but directly threatening, Suakin. Therefore, if that post was to be satisfactorily defended, it was absolutely necessary that General Graham should not retire in face of a victorious force in such a position, but that he should take efficient measures to defeat or disperse it at the spot where it was encamped." 303 "There is every reason to hope that within a short period General Graham's force will have accomplished the purpose for which it was sent—that is to say, the relief of what remained of the garrison of Tokar and the effective protection of Suakin. When this is done I should be disposed to think that the retention of a force of any magnitude such as that at General Graham's command will be certainly unnecessary, and probably it will be easily in the power of the Navy to provide for the security of Suakin during the short interval which may elapse before the final decision is come to as to the permanent garrison—a garrison probably of moderate dimensions—by which Suakin will be held. We have no intention of undertaking any operations for the purpose of punishing or taking any revenge on Osman Digna. We have no intention of undertaking any operations for the purpose of exterminating or making war upon his adherents, so soon as they shall cease to menace the positions which we have announced our intention to maintain and to protect." 304 305 306
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to move to reduce the Vote by £100,000.
(6.50.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : The right hon. Gentleman says he protests in the name of local government. I think he rather protests in the name of coercion in Ireland. He is so accustomed to praising in this House batoning in Ireland, that he cannot refrain from praising the Home Secretary for refusing to interfere in this case. So far as I am concerned, I have listened with a perfectly judicial mind to what has been said, and I have come to the conclusion that there is a  primâ facie
 MR. LABOUCHERE : No, your Friends opposite complained that they were not yours, and they complained that they were not true. In this case
 296 primâ facie
 MR. LABOUCHERE : But how is the Committee composed? How many Magistrates are there on it?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Well, that is quite enough to leaven the mass, and leaven it most injuriously. This is what the right. hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham calls an independent local self-government—a Committee of which half the members are elected and half are nominated by the Lord Lieutenant. It is because we have no local government, in the real sense of the word, in the county, and because the Conservative Government refused to
 297
(7.11.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I was somewhat surprised at the very sanguine observation of the First Lord when this Vote was before us on the last occasion that though Debate had lasted only some 10 or 12 minutes he hoped that this enormous Vote would be granted at once. If the right hon. Gentleman will carry his memory back to 1884, he will remember that the entire month of February in that year was occupied in discussion of this very Vote, and Motions for its reduction, all because there had been an expedition to Tokar, and, therefore, the right hon. Gentleman must not expect us to refrain now from discussing the recent Tokar expedition, and, indeed, the Army in
 298
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I was absent swallowing a hasty cup of tea, but I know what the right hon. Gentleman said; a friend of mine has told me.
(9.25.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I do not think the right hon. Gentleman has given us a fair explanation of the reasons why we are going to take the Eastern Soudan. No doubt, the right hon. Baronet the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs will address the Committee, and I ask him to make a full statement of the arrangements with the Egyptian Government. We wish to know, for instance, whether the recent military operations have been undertaken with the consent and at the desire of the Sultan, and whether it is attended to absolutely reverse the policy laid down by the noble Lord the remember for Rossendale (the Marquess Hartington) as to the abandonment the Soudan. Are we to understand that the province of Tokar is to be seized; is there to be an Egyptian civil and military Government there? Have the Government taken into consideration the great contingency there is of these Dervishes drawing the Egyptians into a real war with the Soudanese, in which the shall have to go to their aid? It must be remembered that the Soudanese strongly object to our holding Suakin. Undoubtedly, they have not engaged in military operations of late against Suakin, but I have no doubt they are very disagreeable neighbours. There is the widest difference between holding Suakin alone, and holding this large territory. What is being done must
 318
(10.56.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I began the Debate by moving the adjournment. I then asked a question of the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. The right hon. Gentleman has said that nothing new has been adduced yet. Since I had the honour of making speech we have had an entirely now phase of the question put before us. We have had this attack upon Tokar. On the last occasion it was only known indistinctly from the first telegram, and I confess I was so aghast that I could hardly believe it was a fact. But, unquestionably, we never have got clearly from the Government any statement as to whether it is intended to annex that country or not. The Government have simply played with the question. They said it could not be called annexation because the Egyptian Government had not abandoned the country, and because the Sultan had not given up his Sovereign rights. I have read to the House a statement made by the Minister in 1884 in which there was a distinct pledge that the Khedive was to abandon the Soudan, and that that was the policy of Her Majesty's Government. But now the old policy is entirely altered. Things have got to such a pitch, we are so down-trodden on this side of the House that we are not allowed when this
 331
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether it has been decided to bring back to England the 2nd Battalion of Scots Guards from Bermuda before the usual time that a battalion on Foreign service returns Home; and, if so, how he intends to treat the extra cost of transport involved in this arrangement so that it shall not fall upon the taxpapers?
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether, in view of the fact that the Khedive of Egypt has abandoned the Soudan, but has not abandoned his "rights of sovereignty" over it, the inhabitants of that country are deemed rebels to their Sovereign by Her Majesty's Government; whether the  de facto 233 de facto de facto
 MR. MATTHEWS : If the hon. Member desires a memorandum I shall be happy to supply it.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Coroner that the jury were sworn to the full name and title of the deceased person.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have given the Coroner's exact words. I take it that the full name was the name in full.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have received a Report from the Chief Constable and have also seen reports of newspapers of different shades of opinion concerning the conflict that unhappily occurred on February 25. Those reports do not bear out the allegations of the hon. Member. The Chief Constable informs me that some 30 persons were more or less injured, but none dangerously, and that only only one female, a little girl, was slightly hurt, having been (it is supposed) crushed by the crowd. It appears that the bailiffs were returning home, escorted by the police, when they and the police were assailed by a riotous crowd, chiefly, as I gather, from Sunderland, and not connected with the Silksworth mines. This crowd continued to shout and pelt the officers with stones and small rivets of iron from the shipyards, hitting many of them, until the superintendent in charge, an old and experienced officer, halted his party and loudly cautioned the mob to desist or he would be compelled to drive them away by force. No attention was paid to this warning; the police charged with drawn batons, and the crowd was dispersed. I am not prepared to say whether or not the police, after making this charge, kept within those bounds of moderation and self-defence which they ought to observe. I have, however, no information before me to show that serious allegations have been made publicly against them. I am informed that the hon. Member for Mid Durham and the miners' officials have openly praised the police for their forbearance in the performance of difficult duties in connection with this strike. The Chief Constable does not apprehend a renewal of excitement or disturbance. I would point out to the hon. Member that the police are reponsible to the Standing Joint Committee, and not to me; and that, if there has been misconduct or excessive violence on the part of the police, complaint should be made to the Local Authority, who will, I have no doubt, make whatever inquiry is necessary. I should be guilty of disrespect to them if I ordered a public inquiry
 239
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I collect from the newspapers that the French Chambers have rejected a Bill by which the Government proposed to legalise what is called the  pari mutuel
 MR. MATTHEWS : I do not gather that the Government proposed to legalise it, but to impose a tax upon it.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : Rivets, not bolts.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I gave the facts from the information given to me.
(5.40.)  MR. MATTHEWS : I do not in the least complain of the action of the hon. Member, or of the manner in which he has presented his case to the House; but I take it that it is perfectly clear that many of those who are his constituents have suffered injuries which are usual when such  mêlées
 MR. MATTHEWS : I know nothing about whether Colonel White was or was not there. I am now going to give the evidence of another witness. Colonel White in his letter said that all went quietly at the evictions until Wednesday the 25th February, when "there was a large and riotous crowd, chiefly from Sunderland." The hon. Member will understand that I am not asserting this to be true; it is the statement of a responsible officer. The letter goes on—
 "The crowd continued to shout and pelt the police with stones and small rivets of iron from the ship yards, hooting many of them, until the Superintendent in charge of the party"— an old and experienced officer, halted them, and loudly cautioned the mob to desist or he would drive them away by force, but as none of them paid attention to his warning, he felt compelled to charge the mob with drawn batons. It had the desired effect of dispersing the riotous mob, and during the conflict some thirty persons were more or less injured, but none dangerously; and only one female, a little girl, supposed to have been crushed by the mob." 284
 MR. MATTHEWS : I do not understand that they were made before any Court of Justice, but in a solicitor's office. While I do not disparage the statements of the various persons, it is quite impossible that I can deal with them, or say anything of their truth one way or the other. The Hon. Member
 283
 MR. MATTHEWS : I can only say what I am told by those who give me information on this subject; but I would point out to the hon. Member that if he wants all these things cleared up he has it in his power to institute a much more satisfactory inquiry than I could direct. He has mentioned the name of one policeman and the number of another, and I do not hesitate to say that if the statements he has read describing the conduct of those policemen can be proved, those men grossly exceeded their duty, and would be liable to proceedings for assault in the same way as any other subject of Her Majesty.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Before whom? Why, before any Magistrate of the land. I commend the suggestion to the hon. Member and to this House, that it would be much more satisfactory that these facts should be sifted and ascertained in a Court of Justice, where there could be full cross-examination of the witnesses, than by means of any inquiry I could offer, unless under statutory enactment, which I hardly think would be asked for in such a case as this. The hon. Member has told us that Superintendent Oliver—
 285 286
 MR. MATTHEWS : I gather from what the hon. Member said that he was not there either.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am advised that the price of mineral spirit is in excess of that of mineral oil, though I cannot say whether it is so to the extent mentioned in the question. There is no provision in the Bill specially directed against the practice of mixing the spirit with the oil. My hon. Friend appears not to have read Clause 3 of the Bill, which contains no provision as to "tank depôts," as stated in the question. Clauses 2 and 3 are specially intended to protect small shops by enabling them to keep the stock usually stored in such shops without registration or license, and subject only to the restriction that the oil shall be kept in substantial closed metal vessels, a method of storage now largely employed and therefore not impracticable. Clause 10 (d) deals with licensed premises only, and lays down
 241
 MR. MATTHEWS : I stated, with as much accuracy as I could, that the praise was given to them for the manner in which they performed a difficult duty, and not in reference to any specific charge. With reference to the question of the hon. Member for Sunderland (Mr. Storey) I can give him no answer beyond that which I have already given, that I cannot find either in the Report of the Chief Constable, or in the reports of the newspapers submitted to me, any confirmation of the allegations he has made. I do not undertake to deny them; all I say is that I do not find any confirmation of them.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I think I have given an ample answer, and I would suggest that any further question should be addressed to those responsible for the conduct of the police.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I shall await the result of the legislative proposals now before Parliament before I decide whether any, and if, so what, increase of the existing staff may become necessary.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, Sir; I believe the figures quoted are substantially accurate. They appear to be based upon the Annual Reports of the Chief Officer of the Metropolitan Eire Brigade. I cannot admit the correctness of the statement in the second paragraph of the question. On the contrary, I am advised that some of the fires have been largely due to petroleum oil in their consequences and effects, and in some instances in their inception. I am further advised that it is not the fact that in such cases the oil has not taken fire, although in some instances there has been salvage of portions of the stock. It is the fact that petroleum oil has hitherto been generally supplied in substantially constructed barrels, but the practice of supplying it in tank wagons, from which the oil is conveyed into metal storage tanks, has rapidly increased, and already largely prevails in some districts. The storage in barrels is not a perfectly safe method, because the storage vessel has to be tapped for delivery. It is itself inflammable, it is liable to leak, and is much less safe than the metal tanks. I cannot express an opinion as to the relative danger arising from mineral oil as compared with turpentine, spirits of wine, and whisky, which must depend to a great extent on
 242
 MR. MATTHEWS : I hope to proceed with the Factory Bill before the Easter Recess, and I have every reason to expect that the Public Health (London) Law Amendment Bill will be in the possession of the House before much progress can be made with the Factory Bill.
 *MR. RAIKES : The mails leaving Dublin in the morning for West Donegal are at present subject to the delay complained of, because the Department has not yet been able to arrange for the use of the train to which the hon. Member
 252
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to say that I have not yet come to any decision on the subject alluded to in the question.
 *MR. RAIKES : I can only answer accurately the question as it appears on
 228
 *MR. RAIKES : The reduction of post-ago recently made on letters between the United Kingdom and the British Colonies did not extend to letters sent intercolonially, as between Barbados and Jamaica, and, consequently, wherever the intercolonial postage was 4d., it remains so for the present. To extend the 2½d. postage further of course would involve further loss of Postage Revenue; but I hope to be able before long to submit proposals to the Treasury for applying the reduced letter postage to all parts of the British Possessions.
 *MR. RAIKES : The time table for the West India Mail Service is arranged so as to afford the greatest amount of postal accommodation between this country and the colonies. The mails homeward are timed to reach this country on one Wednesday and to leave this country outward on the following Wednesday
 229
 *MR. RAIKES : No charge for postage is made to Members upon Parliamentary Papers which are officially despatched from the Vote Office or Sale Office, and hon. Members can arrange with either of those Offices for the transmission of such Papers as they may wish to have forwarded to them when out of London.
 *MR. RAIKES : The payment for a Press telegram is determined by Act of Parliament, and no servant of the Post Office, whether efficient or inefficient, has power to vary the charge. It has been decided in the High Court of Justice that where an insufficient payment has been made at the counter in the first instance, the sender of a message is afterwards liable for the balance of the charge. The fullest facilities are afforded to senders to re-count their messages if they have any doubt as to the correctness of a claim for further payment. If the hon. Member has in his mind any case where these have not been allowed, and will communicate the circumstances to me, I will direct inquiry to be made.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : The total number of Deferred Annuities payable after the age of 60 which have been purchased through the Post Office Savings Bank is 568, and the average amount of these Annuities is £18 1s. 2d.
 *MR. RAIKES : Yes, Sir.
 *MR. RAIKES : The Post Office does not authorise a charge for any Papers sent officially through the Post Office.
(9.35.)  MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : I feel bound to join in offering this protest against the whole of this Egyptian business. I have not been in the House through the whole of the discussions, and therefore I do not know whether this point has been alluded to. It is acknowledged that we have a certain amount of responsibility for the action of the Egyptian Government, and when we see that English officers lead the Egyptian troops in these expeditions it is assumed by the people that these expeditions are undertaken upon instructions from the English Government. As a matter of fact it is the English Government promoting these attacks, because by the presence of our troops in Egypt we liberate a certain number of Egyptian troops for the purpose. The speech of the hon. and gallant Member has let the cat out of the bag, and shows the real position—that, once established anywhere, we must then go a step

 MR. GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether there is any truth in what has appeared in the newspapers with regard to the duration of the Easter Holidays?
 MR. H. GARDNER : Is it intended to proceed with the Bill before Easter?
 MR. HERBERT GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether he is aware of the difficulty which exists in villages and rural districts of obtaining suitable buildings for the purpose of holding public meetings, and whether he will consider the desirability of proposing or accepting legislation which shall secure
 240
 MR. H. GARDNER : I beg to give notice that on the Education Vote I will call attention to this subject.
 MR. JACOB BRIGHT  (Manchester, S.W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if the Post Office has the right, after determining the number of words in a telegram and securing prepayment, to demand a further payment if, through the inefficiency of their servants, they discover an increased charge should have been made by reason of more words being in the message than were counted at the time; and, if they have the right,
 226
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate what public purpose is served by Table B, No. 1, appended to the Report of the Scotch Education Department of 22nd July, 1890; whether the Department has any information to lead them to believe that anything like 120,283 children, being one-seventh of the children of school age, may be receiving "education in higher schools" in Scotland as set forth in said Table; whether he is aware that, according to the same Table, it would appear that there are 419,169 children between the ages of 7 and 12 on the school register of State-aided schools in Scotland, whilst there are only 395,851 possible children in existence in Scotland between these ages available to attend State-aided schools on the basis or assumption of the Table; and whether the Department will, in future, eliminate Table B, No. 1, from their Reports?
 MR. DALTON : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the description of the

 MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he is aware that numerous complaints have been made by the fishermen engaged in the fisheries off Castletown, Berehaven, of constant attacks and depredations committed on them and their property by French fishermen cruising in large luggers; and whether the Admiralty, in view of the fact that the mackerel fishing season is now at hand, will despatch two or three well-fitted cruisers to protect the interests of the fishermen so attacked?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland can he state the cost of keeping three policemen on Castle Island, adjacent to Schull, County Cork; and if the rent is annually £96?
 MR. J. E. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether the seven hours rule in the Savings Bank Department in London will apply to women employed in the Clearing House branch, Dublin; and whether, in view of the fact that women employed in the former Department in London receive a minimum salary of £100, whilst those employed in the latter in Dublin receive only£70, any arrangements are in contemplation to bring the rules of payment more nearly to an equality?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the fact that a police constable named Connell, stationed at Schull, County Cork, deliberately loaded his rifle in the presence of a large assemblage of people returning from a meeting which was addressed by Mr. William O'Brien, M.P.; whether he is also aware that Connell, with another police constable, followed Mr. William O'Brien from Schull to Bantry, carrying a loaded rifle in his hand; and whether police constables, when following Irish Members of Parliament, are ordered to carry loaded firearms?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware
 261
 MR. J. E. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the distress prevailing among the numerous small farmers in the Kiltullagh and Ballinlough Electoral Divisions of the Castlerea Union, county Roscommon; and, whether the poor people of that district may hope for some mitigation of their suffering by the opening of relief works on an early day?
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : Before the question is answered I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman if he is aware or if he has seen a memorandum addressed to the Governor General by 55 lady physicians in reference to a largo number of cases which have come within their own experience, in which they declare in the strongest terms against these marriages?
(6.36.)  MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : I think the question raised by the Motion of my hon. Friend is a much more important one than can be satisfactorily dealt with by any inquiry before a Magistrate. It is a question not merely of one or two assaults by police constables; it is a question of the growing tendency on the part of the police here and there to regard their batons as instruments of punishment rather than as instruments wherewith to defend the law. ["Oh, oh!"] Hon. Gentlemen seem to question that, but over and over again the hon. Member for Sunderland told us of cases in which flying men were pursued and beaten on the back. What right has a policeman to use his baton under such circumstances? It cannot be denied that the same thing has been done in other parts of the country. There is another reason for asking for a more important and solemn and responsible inquiry than can be obtained in the locality. We have observed during the course of this Debate that whenever the energy and vigour of the police has been referred to it has been enthusiastically cheered on the other side. The statement of my hon. Friend, that the police might have done everything that was necessary by threatening to charge, was scouted and sneered at by hon. Gentlemen opposite. When we were told how the police rushed down and violently batoned these unarmed and helpless people there were loud cheers. In those cheers there is very considerable reason for not being satisfied with any local inquiry. The hon. and learned Member for the Ripon

 MR. RANKIN : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Council whether scholars attending evening classes, and who are also in the obligatory standards of an elementary day school, are in a position to receive any assistance from the County Council in respect of any manual or technical instruction given at the evening school?
 MR. RANKIN : Is that from the commencement of the granting of such Annuities?
 MR. RANKIN  (Hereford, Leominster) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he will kindly state the number of persons who have purchased, in the Post Office Savings Bank, Deferred Annuities, payable after the age of 60; and what is the average amount of such annuities?
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : The Table to which the hon. Member refers has appeared in the Report for many years. The assumption of one-seventh as the number of children who might be in attendance at higher schools, was based upon very careful inquiries made by the Schools Inquiry Commission in 1867, and has since been adopted as a general scale. But the Table referred to by the hon. Member at least serves a useful purpose in proving that the applicability of the scale to Scotland is more than doubtful. The Tables appended to the Report are annually revised and re-cast as occasion requires; but it is doubtful whether an alteration

 MR. DEASY  (Mayo, W.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware that a large number of men in the Westport Union have been refused employment on the relief works; and, if so, whether he will give directions that all deserving applicants shall be engaged?
 MR. KEAY : Will the right hon. Gentleman kindly answer the 3rd and 4th paragraphs of the question.
 MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I beg-to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether his attention has been called to the great excitement and apprehension which has been caused in India by the introduction into the Governor General's Council, by Sir Andrew Scoble, of a Bill fixing the ago of consent, in the case of married girls, at 12 years; whether he is aware that puberty very frequently takes place in Indian females before the age of 12 years, while there is no system of registration of births, and consequently no certitude as to the real age of the great majority of the population; whether he is aware that strong resolutions have been passed at mass meetings throughout the Indian Empire protesting against the Bill on the grounds that the European officials responsible for it are ignorant of the injurious effects which it will produce in the social and domestic life of the people, that it will lead to the ruin of innocent families by the fabrication of false charges and put a premium on oppression and extortion by subordinate officials, and declaring that it is a direct interference with native religion and usage, and a clear infringement of the Queen's Proclamation of 1858; whether it is the case, as
 248
 *MR. KEAY : I am alluding to the hon. Member for Northampton when he went over the history of the case. I wish to show that we went to Egypt merely through the action of officials.
 *MR. KEAY : I submit to your ruling, Sir, but I am only taking the historical latitude which was accorded to other speakers.
*(10.14.)  MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary for War complained a short time ago that all that was said from this side of the House was in the nature of reiteration of matter already uttered in previous Debates. I think, whatever may be my feebleness and defects I shall be able to contribute, if allowed by the Chair, to the information which ought to be placed before the House concerning matters which hitherto have not been mentioned. The hon. Member for Sunderland maintained—and I think rightly maintained—that the cause of all the difficulty in which this country has been involved was our original advent into Egypt through means which we all know, namely, the bombardment of Alexandria. I have no doubt that many Members of the House would be glad to consider that that was entirely ancient history. For my own part I cannot consider that it is ancient history until the last corporal's guard of the British Army has evacuated Egypt. The occupation of Egypt was not the doing of the present Government. The events I am about to mention, they were not, at all events directly, responsible for, and they may even have forgotten some of them, miserable as they were. The first of these events was this: We went to Egypt without any declaration of war violating in that respect, the law of nations. We also invaded Egypt absolutely without permission of the English Cabinet.
 *MR. KEAY : I suppose I must understand that the history of the causes which led to our occupation of Egypt is not to be discussed on this occasion. I will, therefore, confine myself to a few remarks as to the financial question. I contend that the financial position in Egypt is such that either this reduction should be passed, and the Egyptian Government should pay the extra expense of our troops out of their own surplus, or else that Her Majesty's Government should prove to the Committee that there is some British reason why the British taxpayer should be mulcted in the amount now asked for. From the examination I have made of Egyptian affairs, I cannot congratulate either the late Government or the present Government upon any real improvement in Egyptian finance. I do not deny that they have, by hook or by crook, extorted from the Egyptian peasantry a large amount of revenue by their scientific system—because I must confess that the British revenue system is, so far as exaction is concerned, a very scientific system of extortion. They have succeeded in extorting from the Egyptian fellaheen all that was obtainable before the war, and a large sum in addition for the maintenance of British soldiers and British Departments. The surplus which is spoken of in connection with Egyptian finance clearly owes its existence to severer revenue laws, and severer extortion from the unfortunate cultivators of the country. I cannot understand—taking even the
 327
 *MR. KEAY : I can only obey the ruling of the Chair. I do not know whether it will be in order to mention that I have heard questions put in this House as to the fact of the disappearance of these people.
 *MR. KEAY : Then I cannot pursue that part of the subject. The next point which I have in my mind is the devastating effect which our action has had on Egypt, inasmuch as through our very first act the whole civil population of Alexandria disappeared at the time of the bombardment, and has never been heard of more.
 MR. JOHN KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that the present price of mineral spirit being some 50 per cent. above that of mineral oil, any practice of mixing the former with the latter is now impossible; and whether he is aware that the regulation as to tank depôts in Clause 6 of the Inflammable Liquids Bill would, in the cases of small shops, be found quite impracticable, as also that in Clause 10 (d) with respect to the isolation of such depôts?
 MR. JOHN KELLY : I beg to ask the right hon. Gentleman, if he is aware that it is stated, at page 248 of the  Year Book of Commerce Year Book of Commerce
 MR. MACNEILL  (Donegal, S.) : I beg-to ask the Postmaster General if he is aware that the mails for the entire West Donegal district are delayed at Strabane for four hours, although a train starts from Strabane to Donegal after the arrival of the mail train at Strabane; what is the reason of this delay; and whether he will take steps for the speedy transmission of the mails from Strabane to Donegal?
 MR. J. MORLEY : Can the right hon. Gentleman answer the third question?
 MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle upon-Tyne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether any proclamation has been issued by the Military Commanders at Suakin as to the intentions of the Egyptian Government towards the tribes; whether any terms have been made with the tribes in the neighbourhood of Suakin and Tokar, for the purposes of common action against the approach of hostile forces from Kassala; and whether, at the fall of Afafite and Tokar, any prisoners were captured; and, if so, in what way they have been disposed of?
 MR. WHARTON : Half and half.
 MR. WHARTON : I believe, Sir, that two members of the Standing Joint Committee are on strike at the present time.
 MR. WHARTON : I have not been quite understood. I stated that I considered the proper course to be taken was, having got at any rate two policemen
 292
(6.15.)  MR. WHARTON : The House must, I think, feel it has just had au honest, straightforward account of what occurred from the hon. Member who last spoke, and will thank him for giving it. I should not myself have risen to say a word on this subject if I had not been alluded to as Chairman of the Joint Committee for the County of Durham, and if I had not been many years before Chairman of the Police Committee of the Magistrates. I want to see justice done to two men who have been referred to, the Chief Constable for Durham and Superintendent Oliver. With respect to Superintendent Oliver, if there is one in the whole Force whom I would have picked out as a man of forbearance and one to be thoroughly trusted it is that gentleman; and unless I hear on sworn authority before a competent tribunal that he was guilty of the acts attributed to him, I shall refuse to believe the allegations. As for the Chief Constable, he is a man whose moderation and courtesy are known in the whole county, and it is a matter of regret to me to hear the hon. Member for Sunderland sneer at the Chief Constable.
 MR. WHARTON : If the hon. Member had applied to the Chief Constable, he would have found him to be a man of great ability and of the greatest possible courtesy. The Government are asked to have an inquiry, but of what kind? If there is to be an inquiry, let it be an inquiry before a competent authority and upon sworn evidence; do not let us have the tittle-tattle of newspapers. If the allegations are that the police have exceeded their duty, it is well that they should be tested before a proper tribunal, and the proper tribunal is the tribunal of the Magistrates. Now, I have heard the hon. Member for Sunderland in this House speak very generously of the Magistrates of the County of Durham, and therefore to-day I was sorry to hear him throw doubt upon their impartial
 289
 MR. WHARTON  (Ripon) : What is the name of the Superintendent?
(6.1.)  MR. JOHN WILSON  (Durham, Mid) : As I was a spectator of these occurrences I can perhaps give the Homo Secretary the information he desires. I am very sorry that disputes between employers and employed have taken place, but I should like to correct an impression which exists, that in the present instance the blame is to be attached to the workmen. The inception of this affair did not be with the workmen, and if their advice had been taken this sad occurrence would never have been brought under the notice of the House. I should like to give a review of what actually took place, as it has been my lot, as agent for the men, to take part in the evictions, and to try to adjust matters. As to the general conduct of the police I have nothing to say, except as to their interference with myself when I was taking-the candy men away from the works. I was told by Superintendent Oliver that the men were under contract, and that they had no right to go away; but I replied that a man is entitled to leave his employment whenever he likes if he is prepared to take the consequences of breaking his contract. As to what has been called the riot of the 25th February, it would be untrue if I were to say that no stones were thrown, because I bear the mark of one on my own forehead. I and others endeavoured to persuade the
 287 288
 MR. J. WILSON  (Durham, Mid) : Will the right hon. Gentleman allow me to ask whether the term "praise" he has applied to the conduct of the police refers to their conduct during the evictions?
(6.43.)  MR. J. CHAMBERLAIN  (Birmingham, W.) : The hon. Gentleman who has just sat down says that the question of real importance raised by the Resolution is the great tendency on the part of the police, who are the guardians of order, to use more force than is absolutely necessary for their purpose. I thought the hon. Gentleman and his friends had already decided that the remedy for any improper conduct on the part of the police was to entrust them to a Local Authority. At all events, that has been their argument with regard to the Irish police. Now, however, it appears that these hon. Gentlemen have no confidence either in the police or in the Local Authority, and that on the first occasion on which a complaint is made against the police force which is under the control of a Local Authority, these gentlemen come down and declare that the one person in whom they have confidence
 294 primâ facie primâ facie 295
 MR. CHAMBERLAIN : They were not mine.
 MR. J. CHAMBERLAIN  (Birmingham, W.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade if his attention has been called to the illegal shipment of incompetent seamen as A.B.'s at the port of Cardiff, as appears from the statement of R. Phillips and others, reported in the  South Wales Daily News 225
 MR. J. CHAMBERLAIN : When will the right hon. Gentleman be ready to give an answer to the other part of the question, which refers to the action of the Department?
(6.20.)  MR. ATHERLEY-JONES  (Durham, N.W.) : I quite agree with what fell from the hon. Gentleman who last spoke as to the extremely high character of Superintendent Oliver, and as to the great capacity and extreme urbanity of the Chief Constable. I have long known both gentlemen, and am, satisfied that they endeavour to perform their duties satisfactorily. My real motive in intervening in this Debate is to urge upon the Home Secretary the strong advisability of instituting an inquiry. If I may say so, I do not quite agree with the accuracy of his statement that in the past there have only been two Departmental Inquiries. As far as my investigations have gone, there have been more than two inquiries info occurrences such as these. And, again, with regard to Mr. Bridge's inquiry at Cardiff, I may point out to the right hon. Gentleman he was not quite right in saying it was conducted at the instance of the Local Authority, for I believe the Home Office authorities were the first to suggest that a special investigation should be made. The hon. Member for the Ripon Division said that to order an inquiry before Justices of the Peace was a proper and legitimate course to pursue. I do not deny that, generally speaking, it would be the proper course; but the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me for pointing out that at an investigation at Petty Sessions the inquiry is limited to the circumstances of the particular case before the Committee, and the investigation is controlled by the ordinary rules of evidence. Now, such an inquiry as that which was held at Cardiff must result in eliciting information which could not be adduced before a Court of Petty Sessions; and I am sure that the sending down to Durham of a Metropolitan Magistrate to investigate this
 290
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : No, Sir. The values referred by the hon. Member are not at present included in the Trade Returns; but the question of appending a statement of the values of such vessels has been for some time under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government. In the event of its being decided to obtain this information, legislation would probably be necessary.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I do not know whether Saturday is the latest day for the presentation of Petitions, but, if it is, I propose to ask the House to pass some Resolution like that it has passed with reference to the Water Bill, allowing all petitioners to be heard who apply five clear days before the opening of the Committee.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I cannot say at present. If the right hon. Gentleman will defer the question for a week I think I shall be able to answer it.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : Yes, Sir; my attention has been directed to the cases to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, but I am not in a position to give a categorical reply until I have received the Report of the Cardiff Local Marine Board, who have made an inquiry with regard to all the circumstances. I may, however, add that it has always been held at the Board of Trade that there is nothing in Section 7 of the Merchant Shipping (Payment of Wages and Rating) Act, 1880, which confers power upon a Superintendent to refuse to allow a man to sign on as an A.B. without production of a certificate or certificates mentioned in that section. This view of the section is borne out by the following paragraph in the Final Report of the Loss of Life at Sea Commission, 1884:—
 "With respect to the rating of 'Able Seamen,' it is now the law that no man is entitled to he go rated unless he can prove four years' service at sea before the mast. There is, however, great laxity in this respect. Men are constantly rated as 'A.B.' without any inquiry as to their past services and with insufficient qualification: practically it rests with the masters of vessels whether to rate them as such or not. Nor does it appear to us that there is any certain method by which this can be prevented."
 MR. OCTAVIUS V. MORGAN  (Battersea) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware that the submarine telegraph communications on the West Coast of South America from Valparaiso running North are in the control of a United States Company domiciled in New York, and the land line (the Trans Andean)
 263
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : Does the right hon. Gentleman, in putting the Bill down for Monday, intend that it shall be taken at an hour when it can be discussed?
(12.25.)  MR. CAUSTON : I am in favour of a Registration Acceleration Bill, but with freedom to propose Amendments. But if we only enter upon the Bill after 12 o'clock there is no opportunity of dealing with Amendments, and
 343
 MR. HERMON-HODGE  (Lancashire, Accrington) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board a question of which I have given him private notice. It is whether, considering the misapprehension that exists, he can inform the House what  locus standi
 MR. WEBSTER  (St. Pancras, E.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that on a recent occasion the Royal Mail Company's vessel  Don Don Orinoko
 MR. WEBSTER : I beg further to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether the mail steamer from Barbados to the United Kingdom is timed to start two days before the outward mail steamer arrives; and whether, if that is so, it would be possible to arrange that the mail from the United Kindgom should arrive two days prior to the departure of the mail from Barbados to Europe?
 MR. WEBSTER : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that the rate of postage from Barbados to Jamaica is 4d. per. ounce, whilst from either of these West Indian Islands to the United Kingdom, the United States, or South America the rate is only 2½d. per ounce; and if it is in any way practicable to reduce the postal rates charged by the various West Indian Islands, especially as between them selves?
 MR. SAMUEL SMITH  (Flintshire) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been drawn to the recent decision of the Chamber of Deputies in Franco, which has decided to suppress every kind of public betting at race meetings, and even the Paris mutual bookmakers are to be interdicted; and whether the Government will take in to consideration the expediency of proposing similar legislation for this country?
 MR. SAMUEL SMITH : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in view of the many recent cases of the House having been counted out on private Members' nights, the Government will take into consideration the expediency of proposing a change in the Standing Orders whereby the House, on such occasions, would be enabled to pass to the next business on the Paper instead of standing adjourned?
 MR. S. SMITH : I wish to supplement the questions which have just been asked by another, namely, whether the right hon. Gentleman is aware that the most intelligent class of Hindoos, and nearly all the Mahommedans, are in favour of raising the age to 12 years?
 MR. STOREY  (Sunderland) : I bog to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that nearly 50 persons were wounded, some of them dangerously, and all of them but three with blows behind, in the recent baton-charge by the police at Silksworth; that respectable unoffending persons, both male and female, quietly walking home by the very side of the police, were struck and kicked by them; what time, if any, was allowed to those persons to get out of the way between the time when the police faced about and the charge was delivered; and whether, in view of the serious allegations publicly made against the police, and in view of the probable renewal of
 238
 MR. STOREY : I beg to give notice that I shall take the earliest opportunity of bringing this serious matter before the House, and of placing the real facts of the case before the right hon. Gentleman.
 MR. STOREY : I object.
(12.22.)  MR. STOREY  (Sunderland) : In my judgment some of the Amendments which appear upon the Paper are by no moans germane to the Bill as promoted, but I want to represent to the right hon. Gentleman that at any rate in my part of the country there are very serious
 342
 MR. STOREY : I see it is a useful measure; therefore, I will waive my objection.
 MR. STOREY : I object to its being taken at such an hour as this—half-past 12.
(11.1.)  MR. STOREY : The exact position of affairs is this. A question was asked of the Government from this side. The Gentleman whom we particularly wanted to answer it was not in his place—I refer to the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. We have now been told that the reason for not answering the question was that it had already been answered; and the head of the Government, when he told us that, complained that one 'Member of this House had spoken first for 40 minutes and afterwards for 30 minutes without adducing a single new fact. Thereupon all the hon. Members opposite, who had not listened to the Debate, with that astounding faith and gullibility of disposition which distinguishes the Tory Party, accepted the statement of their chief. Now, I contravene the statement that the question we have asked has been answered. The question was this: Sir Evelyn Baring, in 1884, said the Khedive accepted gratefully the policy of the abandonment of the whole of the Soudan, which he believed, on mature reflection, to be best in the interests of Egypt. If that be correct, then how do the Government reconcile it with the forward movement
 332
 MR. STOREY : I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. I did not sneer at him. I only said that as far as I knew he had not been applied to.
 MR. STOREY : Before whom?
 MR. STOREY : Was Colonel White there?
 MR. STOREY : I did not want to trouble the House with an unnecessary repetition of statements, but I asserted, and I can, I think, prove, that there were no rivets thrown. If my statement is contradicted, I want to have the contradiction from some one who was there, and who can say he saw what went on. I know that what the right hon. Gentleman asserts has been said in some of the newspapers, but against that I put the testimony of those who were present.
 MR. STOREY : Superintendent Oliver, who called the men back to the ranks and ordered the sergeant to take their names. The Superintendent, when I applied personally, refused to give the names, and referred me to Colonel White. I did not propose to write to Colonel White, feeling it was the duty of the Superintendent to disclose the names of the officers who were charged with assault. But the point to which I wish to call attention is this—All this occurred 40 minutes after what the right hon. Gentleman calls a riot. No less than six persons saw the whole of the circumstances, and can prove that the man did not interfere with the police, and that the police made a brutal and deliberate assault upon him. After the details I have given, it will be believed that there is a great deal of feeling both in Sunderland and in that part of the City of Durham. I do not think the Home Secretary would read another answer as he did the last, in a tone which implied, amidst approving cheers opposite, that this was a riotous mob from Sunderland. There never was a riotous mob from Sunderland—["Oh!"]—save in the old days, when Sunderland was Tory. There was no riotous mob from Sunderland that day. What rioting and stone-throwing there was occurred among those who struck on the outskirts of the crowd, yet the Superintendent and his men fell upon and batoned and kicked respectable persons who had a perfect right to be on the high road. For that reason I felt it my duty to move the adjournment of the House, feeling certain that, although there are political differences, hon. Members opposite will not yield to us in seeing that the liberties of the English subject are preserved, and that the power of the police shall be kept in absolute legal control, and under the authority of those who represent the public. I beseech the right hon. Gentleman, when he gets up, not to say that this is a case for inquiry by the Joint Committee. I think I have made out a sufficient case to justify the Home Secretary in granting a public inquiry. I know he will suggest that we might have gone before a Magistrate. That will be done in one or two cases; but the House will readily understand, in the dust of a  mêlée 282
 MR. STOREY : What I meant roughly was that these statements were not made in the hurry of the moment, but were serious legal documents.
 MR. STOREY : Yes, I quite understand the right hon. Gentleman is the victim of misrepresention in the matter, but let me assure him that though it is
 276 "I am a tradesman on my own account—a painter. I went to Silksworth to deliver an estimate for some painting for a builder who had written to me. I saw the police coming. I walked along the road with them. One of the police, James Ware, was a friend of mine. I was talking with him as we went down front the chapel into the 'slack.' About half a dozen stones were thrown, not more. When we were about half way up the bank one of the sergeants dropped behind, went through the hedge into the field, caught three hoys who were throwing stones, and gave them a thrashing with his stick. When he did so I saw a number of persons, mostly girls, right behind, who threw dry earth and stones at the police. The Superintendent called 'halt,' and faced the men round. I was close to the Superintendent, and I never heard him tell the people to go away. My friend said to me, 'Skip out of the road, Bill, there's going to be a row.' I stepped to one side with my hands in my pockets. The police rushed straight at where I was and thrashed me all over the body with a great number of blows so that I am black and blue all over. I was just about losing my senses, and was lying in the ditch, when one of the policeman lifted his baton to strike me. At this moment another policeman running by said, 'Look out Dryden here's another.' Dryden looked round, and then turned and struck me as I lay. He brought his baton down with the full force of his arm on the hack of my head which I had raised, split my head open, and the blood spurted all over me. He said, 'Hush you—take that.' I turned up my eyes to him and saw him distinctly. I was lying in the ditch helpless. I got up and crawled on my hands and knees a few yards further on the road towards Sunderland. The Superintendent was then gathering the men back into the ranks. I had
 277 278 279 280 "I am a miner at Silksworth Colliery, but I live in Sunderland. On Wednesday, February 25th, I wag up at Silksworth, I was in the shed being erected to house the furniture when the charge occurred—" mêlée "When I left the village there were five Superintendents of Police." "One of them said to me, as I was passing, 'If you Sunderland fellows come up to-morrow you will get your heads cracked.' I said, What for? I have as much right on the high road as you.'" "I went towards Sunderland, and when I got up to Davison's public house—" "a body of police were standing. I walked past. The police shouted 'You shipyard b——s,' and made signs as if they would thrash them. I ran. Four of them came out of the ranks and ran after me. On" of them struck me on the side of the head as I ran, and knocked me down on my face in the road. When I was down, he kicked me twice; when I got up, he struck me right and left, and knocked me into the hedge. I got up again, and ran for my hat; another policeman struck me; his number, I believe, is 481. I got up and said: 'Mind, I have your number; you will hear from me about this.' I then walked away."
 MR. STOREY : Well, there is no substantial difference. But, I say, according to all independent information obtainable on the spot, the statement is not true. But, however, these clods of earth and stones were thrown from the outskirts of the crowd, and then the Superintendent halted his men, faced about, and, without any warning to the people, ordered
 274 275 "Men, you have had provocation, and I admit you have behaved well to us in the village, but for goodness sake do not charge the people again. Keep quiet and leave us to clear the streets."
 MR. STOREY , Member for Sunderland, rose in his place, and asked leave to move I he Adjournment of the House, for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "the illegal and un justifiable conduct of the police during the recent evictions at Silksworth, near Sunderland, and particularly on Wednesday, the 25th February, 1891"; but the pleasure of the House not having been signified, Mr. SPEAKER called on those Members who supported the Motion to rise in their places, and not less than 40 Members having accordingly risen:—
(4.50.)  MR. STOREY : The circumstances I will venture to bring before the I louse took place within two miles of my own home, and the victims of the police were mainly constituents of my own. The right hon. Gentleman just now suggested to me that it was possible for the Joint Standing Committee of the County Council and the Magistrates of Durham to make an inquiry into this matter. I fully grant that that is so, but I would venture to point out to him that that is not sufficient under the circumstances which I shall be able to lay before the House. The precise facts as to the County of Durham may be discussed by the Joint Committee, but the constitutional question involved in the circumstances which occurred at the recent evictions is one which is not fit for a Committee to deal with, but one which should rather be dealt with by this House. I am very sorry that the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland left his place just as I rose, because I wanted to assure him that he will find in these matters I am going to bring before the House plentiful proof of how the evil seed which he has sown in Ireland has already taken root, and brought forth fruit in our own country of England. I, of course, shall not
 270 271 "When I entered the first house it was occupied by a man and his wife, and others. I said, 'Here, Boss? we do not want to do this. Open the back door and let us out.' He was going to do so when two policemen prevented him." "Some of the men tried to get away on the road. I saw them try to get away, and I saw them dragged back by the police." "We were then marched off between the police. They said we should not leave, and I was afraid to break away." "We were at the gates stopped by the police, who stretched their arms across and prevented us from leaving." 272 "I saw two of us trying to get away. A police constable dragged them back. I would have left but I was afraid of the constable. I tried to get out of the back door, but the constable stopped me by getting hold of mo." "Barrill' (that is one of the superintendents) took me by the arm and shoved me two or three times towards the door to prevent me from getting out of the house I wanted to escape from. Another police constable got hold of me by the arm and said he would put me in an iron cage, that would do me good for a bit. We said we might as well be in gaol as doing the dirty work we were engaged in. I was thrown out into the middle of the road by two policemen." "I saw several get away, but the police constables got them and brought them back down the back streets, and I saw Bradshaw try to go, but he was pulled back by a police constable." "When I got back I tried to get away from the gate, but a policeman stopped me. I said, I want to go home.' The policeman said, 'You had better go back again.' I said, 'I won't.' The policeman then shoved me away up the yard and locked the gate upon me." 273
 MR. STOREY : Only one.
(9.41.)  MR. STOREY : The right hon. Gentleman thinks there are more important matters to discuss on the next Votes, but I venture to differ from him because in this question the honour of this country and the honour of the Government are involved: the honour of the country because we have pledged ourselves to Europe that we will at a convenient time come out of Egypt, and we on this side hold that the futher you advance into the Soudan the more you retard the time of our departure from Egypt—the honour of the Government of this country because the foreign

(8.25.)  MR. S. STOREY  (Sunderland) : When the hon. Member says that it is the policy of Egyptians not to go outside Egypt, I am afraid he has not met those officials in the full pride of official costume, but in circumstances and places of a more pleasant character. If he had seen them officially he would probably have ascertained what is the prevailing opinion of Egyptian officers, who, almost to a man, are in favour of extending the bounds of Egypt. Their conviction was that they should sustain Anouan by going to Dongola, Suakin by going to Tokar, and Tokar by going to Berber, and Kassala. I opposed this occupation of Egypt from the first. I have not made 201 speeches about it, but I have spoken eight or nine times in six or seven years against the occupation of Egypt, and against the projection of British arms into the Soudan. Formally, I must make my protest against this projection of Egyptian arms some distance into the Soudan, because I know it carries out the hidden intentions of the Pashas, who, when we leave Egypt, will be the masters. Their conviction is that they ought to have the whole territory which belonged to Egypt 15,20, or 30 years ago. It is because the little movement at Tokar is as the beginning of the letting out of water that I am disposed to take objection to a matter which may appear extremely trivial. Somebody on the Treasury Bench talked as if Tokar were a fertile oasis. What nonsense. Why, there are a hundred more fertile oases around Egypt. It was not Suakin or the defeat of Osman Digna, but the carrying out of a secret policy of the Turkish Pashas that was fought in going to Tokar under the cover
 314 315 316 317
 MR. STOREY : Does the right hon. Gentleman mean to allege that respectable and unoffending persons, male and. female, quietly walking home, by the very side of the police, were not struck and kicked. What time was allowed to these respectable people to get out of the way?
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the three years' contract for repairing barracks, fortifications, sea fronts, building stores, guardrooms, barrack officers' quarters, &c, comes to an end on the 31st March next; and what steps the Department intends to take, in reference to the new contract, to carry out the Resolution adopted by the House on 13th February in regard to the sub-letting of Government contracts and payment of fair wages?
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he intends to introduce the Budget before the Easter Recess?
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he proposes to proceed with his Factory and Workshops Bill in Standing Committee before the House is in possession of, or has read a second time, the Public Health (London) Law Amendment Bill and the Public Health (London) Law Consolidation Bill, to be introduced by the President of the Local Government Board; and whether he
 244
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I beg to postpone until Monday the question of which I have given notice to
 251
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that the Guardians of the Ballyshannon Union have this year accepted a tender for printing and advertising largely in excess of the amount which a competent local contractor offered to do the work for; and if the Local Government Board has had its attention drawn to this waste of the rates in a Union for which relief works are being claimed?
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the attention of the Government has been drawn to the acutedistress in Ranafushe, Loughanoran, and Ranamona, in Anagany district, county Donegal; whether he is aware that in these localities fever prevails, deaths are extraordinarily numerous, 875 people are left without potatoes or other food, credit is exhausted, debts amount to an average of about. £10 per family, and the inquiry by the police many weeks ago has only resulted in assistance being given to 2 per cent. of the famishing population; and whether the Government will adopt prompt measures for the saving of life by affording immediate employment in the neighbourhood?
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland what has been the result of the Conference between the Irish Government and the Irish Prisons Board, concerning the unanimous protest of the Corporation of Belfast against the projected alterations of Her Majesty's Prison at Belfast, upon the several grounds that they would create an eyesore, destroy the frontage line, and deteriorate the value of property in the district?
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether after the evidence that has been given at the hearing of the recent prosecutions against Messrs. Topping and Walkington, Belfast, concerning the misleading description that is branded upon American lard, to the effect that such lard is sold in England as Irish, the Attorney General for England will direct the police to enforce in Bristol, and in the other English towns in which
 260
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury what is the result of the consideration given by the Treasury to the proposals of the Postmaster General respecting the Larne and Stranraer route?
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : It cannot take precedence of Supply or other urgent Public Business. It is for hon. Members themselves to say whether it should be taken after 12 o'clock.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Only with the consent of the House.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : No, Sir; no decision has been come to on the subject.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The Government are not prepared to adopt the course suggested by the hon. Member.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am afraid that the answer to that question requires consideration; but I do not think that Private Bill promoters are the most necessitous and deserving class of the community.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : The counts out to which the hon. Member alludes were, I am afraid, attributable to a disinclination on the part of the House to take any further business, and I do not think the proposal of the hon. Member would be of any use in meeting such a state of things, nor, should an alteration of the Standing Orders of the House be lightly undertaken, even if it were possible to find the time for the necessary discussion.
*(4.48.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : I trust my hon. Friend will be satisfied with the statement which he has made to the House. Undoubtedly, it is a painful matter for him to be accused of dishonourable conduct in a newspaper of considerable position; but I am sure greater experience and knowledge of the practice of Parliament and of the reports, which are usually so very accurate, of proceedings in this House will induce him to overlook what I believe to be a mistake and not a wilful misrepresentation on the part of the journal in question; and to accept the assurance which I give him that I distinctly understood he refused to allow this Bill to be referred to a Select Committee, and that the course
 269
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am not able to say positively. We shall go on with the Supplementary Estimates until they are concluded.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Supply.
 MR. WILLIAM HENRY SMITH  rose in his place, and claimed to move, "That the Question be now put."
 MR. AINSLIE  (Lancashire, N. Lonsdale) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War if he could explain on what grounds the grant of 12s. par efficient Volunteer is held to be enough for the provision of the equipments required under the regulations in the cases of country battalions; if he is aware that the lowest charge at which these equipments are procurable is 18s.; if he can make a distinction in favour of battalions whoso detachments are widely scattered; and if he is aware that the regulation which limits this grant of 12s. to efficients on the previous October will adversely affect those corps which were below their strength at that time?
*(11.53.)  THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE WAR OFFICE (Mr. BRODRICK,  Surrey, Guildford : Our experience is whenever an officer has the opportunity of employing old soldiers he does so, and the men receive proper consideration. I am surprised, therefore, to hear the statement made by the hon. and gallant Member, and some inquiry shall be made into the matter.
*(11.55.)  MR. BRODRICK : I can explain the position in a few words. The present Army Agents have undertaken to continue to issue the pay of officers without any charge, and this will cause a large diminution in the amount voted from January next. The right of the officers to a continuance of agency has been recognised for a long period, and is based on a surrender of pay by the officers in consideration of agency being established.
 *MR. BRODRICK : This subject has been several times previously brought before the House, and the Secretary of State for War will undertake that the reference to the Committee that is about to sit on the Recruiting Question will be drawn in such a way as to enable them to take the matter into consideration. That will certainly be the most efficient way of dealing with it.
 *MR. JACKSON : It would be rather difficult to state accurately.
 *MR. JACKSON : I am informed that the fees received on Private Bills in the House of Commons during the financial year 1889–90 amounted to about£24,800. The fees received in the House of Lords were probably about the same amount. It is not in contemplation to make any reduction in the present scale of fees.
 MR. JACKSON : No, Sir; no decision has been arrived at, but the matter is under consideration.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : Loans to landlords and farmers are made under a special Act of Parliament which prescribe the terms of repayment. Loans to Town Commissioners are made under an entirely different principle, and I see no reason why the two should be assimilated.
 MR. JOHNSTON  (Belfast, S.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the statement is correct that lodging house keepers have been charged 9d. in the £1 as formerly; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take in order that the amount in excess should be refunded?
(10.23.)  Mr. JOHNSTON  rose in his place, and claimed to move, "That the Question be now put; "but the CHAIRMAN withheld his assent, and declined then to put that Question.
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the Government will consider the advisability of referring to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council the determination of the question whether Roman Catholics are or are not eligible to hold the offices of Lord Chancellor of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the same manner in which it is proposed to take the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with regard to the state of the Marriage Law in Malta?
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg-to ask the President of the Local Government Board with reference to the proposed arrangement for the provision of a public cemetery at Hyde, whether, in the event of a portion of the cemetery being consecrated, the Bishop of the Diocese would have the right to insist upon a separate chapel being built, at the expense of the rates, for the Episcopalians, in the consecrated portion of the cemetery; whether he would have control over all monuments and inscriptions in that portion of the cemetery; and whether he would have the right of appointing a chaplain to be paid for by the Corporation at a salary to be approved by him?
*(10.7.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I can understand the anxiety of the Minister for War to get this Vote. I suppose this is what he would call the dangerous part of the Army Estimates, and that he thinks that if he can get this item he will be able to go on for
 324 325
 *MR. F. S. POWELL  (Wigan) : There is no opposition to the Bill from any quarter of the House, and I hope the hon. Member will allow this stage to be taken.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg leave to withdraw my Amendment.
(11.40.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I have given notice of my intention to move another reduction, but the point I wished to raise has been to some extent answered by what the Secretary of State for War has just said. I wished to move a reduction in respect of the troops employed in colonies which at present pay no contributions whatever. There are several colonies which do not pay one farthing towards the cost of troops. I hope we are to understand that the Committee which is sitting will consider the whole subject. If I am right in that understanding, it is not necessary I should raise that particular point. I am glad to see the Secretary for War assents to that. While I am on my legs, I want to refer to the general subject of this Vote—the cost of the men and officers of the Army. The more I see and read, the more and more convinced I am that we are going too much on the old-fashioned line of sacrificing to a morbid desire to maintain a totally inefficient Army the defensive forces of the country. The real defensive forces are emasculated in order to maintain an offensive regular force which is really quite contemptible from a European point of view. The Militia is far below
 337
*(11.31.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I gladly acknowledge that Her Majesty's Government are doing a good deal in regard to the question. I have often brought to the notice of the House, the necessity of the colonies making an annual contribution towards the troops employed within their borders. I am surprised to hear Her Majesty's Government
 335
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : I now want to move a reduction of the Vote in respect of the troops employed in South Africa. I have constantly protested against the system of making the British taxpayer pay the whole of our military expenditure. These colonies are called upon to contribute only a nominal sum. Now the Government propose to give responsible Government to Natal, and I want to know if any arrangements have been made as to the cost of the military defence of Natal? The right hon. Gentleman the Undersecretary for the Colonies, with that audacity which characterises some of his statements, told us that no very serious civil or military questions were involved in this matter, but I do not agree with him. This is a matter worthy the attention of Parliament that involves the expenditure of a large sum, and I, therefore, think we are entitled to know what arrangements have been made, and if the taxpayers of this country will be relieved of the cost of the military defence of Natal. I beg to move the reduction of the vote by £80,000.
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : Will Her Majesty's Government make it a stipulation that Natal will keep up a force sufficient for the protection of Natal so that the taxpayers of this country will not be burdened with any charge?
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : I contend that, if the Egyptians continue in the Soudan, and the tribes are moved to reprisals, they will have to remain there, and they will have to occupy the whole district. I think you had much better draw the line at Egypt proper, leaving them as the utmost hope, to govern themselves, but never deeming them able to govern other people.
*(8.22.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I entirely differ from the view of the right hon. Gentleman. Egypt, with a quiet population and a large revenue, might succeed in self-government, but the Egyptians are not capable of governing the Soudan, inhabited by warlike tribes, and with little revenue and small means. It was the prudent policy of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian to abandon the Soudan, as the Egyptians were not fitted to govern that country. The Secretary for War said
 313
*(7.52.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : The other night we dealt with the Vote for the number of men employed in Egypt, and I will not go over that ground again now. I think we
 307 308 309
 MR. KIMBER : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he has any objection to lay upon the Table and to circulate for general information a memorandum of the data and reasons upon which the Inflammable Liquids Bill is founded?
 MR. KIMBER : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that if Papers other than the Votes are sent on additional postage is charged?
 MR. KIMBER  (Wandsworth) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether there is any reason why the Blue Books and other Parliamentary Papers should not be posted to the residences of Members who reside out of London, as well as the Votes and Orders of the Day, without charge to the Members?
(6.30.)  SIR H. DAVEY  (Stockton) : I am rather disappointed we have not received some assurance from the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for
 291
 SIR HORACE DAVEY  (Stockton) : I bog to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government have received from the British South Africa Company a Minute or Memorandum of the terms upon which they are prepared, in the event of their obtaining' possession of the territory claimed by the Mozambique Company, to confirm the grants and concessions made by that company: and, if so, what is the effect of it; whether it is the fact that the British South Africa Company cannot, by their charter, acquire powers of administration over any territory by Treaty without the approval of the Secretary of State; and whether the Secretary of State will make it a condition of his approval of the acquisition by the British South Africa Company of powers of government and administration over Manicaland
 264
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : No such Minute or Memorandum has been received as is mentioned in the first paragraph. The British South Africa Company can acquire powers of administration by agreement, but they cannot exercise them without the approval of the Secretary of State. Whatever may be the arrangements made or sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government with regard to Manica, the lawfully acquired rights of individuals and companies will receive every consideration.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Part of the Northern line is in the hands of an English Company, part of an American, the line to Buenos Ayres in those of a local company. The Despatches received from Her Majesty's Minister could only come by one of these routes; they were in cypher; some from the Naval Commander-in-Chief were sent from ports in Peru. Chile is not a member of the Telegraph Union, and is therefore unrestricted as regards telegraph communications; but even if she were, the Convention provides for the stoppage of private messages in code or cypher when it is considered to be contrary to the interests of the State that they should be sent. In these circumstances, Her Majesty's Government do not feel that they can at present make any representations on the Subject to the Chilian Government.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I have been requested by my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for India to reply to this question. The Bill in question was introduced by the Government of India, with a full knowledge of the facts of the case and after very careful consideration. There is no intention of withdrawing it. In regard to the questions of the hon. Member for Leicester (Mr. Picton) and the hon. Member for Flintshire (Mr. S. Smith), I am not in a position to answer them, and if further information is required notice had better be given.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I think the answer I have given covers the whole of the question. It is impossible to enter into details.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON (for Sir J. GORST) : I presume that the hon. Member refers to an answer given to the late Mr. Bradlaugh in July last. I can only repeat, in answer to the present question, the information given to Mr. Bradlaugh in a letter from the India Office in December last, namely, that the whole subject of the Bengal Judicial Establishments is under consideration; that the proposals of the Government of India have not yet been submitted to the Secretary of Stats in Council; and that, therefore, the correspondence is not in a state to be presented as a Parliamentary Return.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON (for Sir J. GORST) : The attention of the Government of Bombay has been called to the subject by the questions which have been asked in this House. The Secretary of State does not consider it necessary to issue the directions suggested. The answer to the second paragraph of the question is—yes. The answer to the third paragraph is that the provisions of the present Bombay Act for the protection of the Salt Revenue are more precise than those contained in the former Act; and the answer to the fourth paragraph is—yes.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : No, Sir, I am unable to say.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I believe the Secretary of State considers that the law as it is administered is satisfactory.
*(11.11.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N. E. : The only reason why I did not answer was that I dealt fully with every point raised when this matter was discussed a few nights ago, and I felt that to repeat what I said on that occasion would be to waste the time of the Committee. I listened to the speech of the Member for Northampton and to some others which followed and I certainly did not hear one question which has not already been amply answered. Having made the most specific declarations as to the policy of the Government, having stated that there has been no departure from the policy of 1886, that the movement on Tokar was made in connection with the defence of the Red Sea ports, and that there is no intention of advancing into the interior of the country, I felt it to be unnecessary to take up the time of the House by repeating these assurances.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : That, also, the Government are at present unable to answer.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Since the right hon. Gentleman gave notice of this question inquiry has been made by telegraph, but as yet the Egyptian Government have no information on the subjects mentioned.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : Her Majesty's Ambassador is using his friendly offices with the Ottoman Government.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : According to the Turkish Papers, Moussa Bey was sent under police escort to Medina on the 19th of October last.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Papers will shortly be presented which will include the Reports of the British Consul on the state of the Island. It cannot be said that disturbances have again broken out, but frequent murders take place both of Christians and of Mussulmans. Some of these crimes are attributed to gendarmes. One of these cases was that of a Christian lad of 18, who was recently found murdered with circumstances of great atrocity.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : (1.) The rights of sovereignty are the Sultan's, not the Khedive's. Subjects of the Sultan resisting authority exercised in his name are rebels. Since 1885 the collisions which have occurred with any inhabitants of the Soudan have been provoked by themselves. (2 and 11.) We know nothing of the  de facto 234 "They will be prepared to assist in maintaining order in Egypt Proper, and in defending it as well as the ports in the Red Sea." "Her Majesty's Government will on their part be prepared to assist in maintaining order in Egypt Proper, and in defending it as well as in continuing to protect the ports in the Red Sea."
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : No such Petition has, so far as we know, been received by Sir William White, but a letter was addressed to Her Majesty's Consul at Aleppo on October 21 last containing the incredible statement that 400 children had been vaccinated with intentionally poisoned lymph by a doctor sent by the Governor for the purpose, and had died in consequence. As I have already stated, Sir William White has taken steps to inquire into the truth of the varying statements that have been made respecting occurrences at Zeitoun.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : No prosecution has, so far as we know, been instituted. Inquiry will be made as to what stops the Porte proposes to take in the matter.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Since answering the question put by the hon. Member for East Grinstead on the 2nd of February, the Admiral on the Station has reported that he had sent two ships of war to visit certain places to the north and south of Hong Kong, where it was thought some information might be obtained, but they totally failed to learn anything of value, and up to the 8th of January the pirates were still at large, instructions are being sent to the Governor of Hong Kong to report what measures he proposes to take with a view to preventing the surreptitious embarkation of arms by Chinese passengers in future.
 MR. BRUNNER : My desire was that the Government should adopt some means of making the organisation in Pall Mall better known, and I trust that the point will receive attention.
(11.56.)  MR. BRUNNER  (Cheshire, Northwich) : I should like to know from the Government whether there is any official organisation to which employers in the country can apply when they want to obtain the services of old soldiers. The only organisation of which I have 'any knowledge is, I understand, an entirely voluntary one. It has an office in London, but it is not sufficiently known. There are, I believe, a very large number of employers who would be very glad to have old soldiers of good character in their service. I have some in my service, and I find them exceedingly steady and intelligent.
 SIR JOHN KENNAWAY  (Devon, Honiton) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can obtain from Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople any information respecting the delay in granting a firman to the English Episcopal Church at Nablus, which was erected in 1881, and opened for service in 1882; and whether he will instruct Her Majesty's Ambassador to use his friendly offices with the Ottoman Government to procure the issuing of the firman?
 MR. LENG : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether it is intended to lay the Report of the Intra-departmental Committee on the
 230
 MR. LENG  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education if he can state the total numbers of male and female scholars and of male and female teachers in the State-aided schools under the inspection of Her Majesty's Inspectors in the United Kingdom, at the latest date to which statistics have been supplied?
 SIR JOHN SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether it is a fact that Sir William White has received a Petition from the Christian inhabitants of Zeitoun, in Armenia, which contains the allegation that 400 children have died from the effects of poison intentionally introduced into the system when they were vaccinated by a doctor acting under the orders and direction of the Turkish Governor, Salih Pasha?
*(11.48.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE : Are the Government in a position to say when they intend to withdraw the troops from Natal?
*(11.14.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : Are the Government going to maintain the policy of occupying Tokar and Handoub? That is what we want to know.
 *SIR J. GOLDSMID : Does the First Lord of the Treasury think it right that the expenses of the House of Commons should be paid by the promoters of Private Bills?
 *SIR J. GOLDSMID : What is the balance of profit to the Treasury on these fees?
 SIR J. GOLDSMID  (St. Pancras, S.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the fees paid to the Houses of Commons and Lords by promoters of Private Bills bring in a considerable
 262
 SIR R. PAGET  (Somerset, Wells) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether it is the fact that Saturday next is the last day for the presentation of Petitions against the Railway Rates Provisional Order Bills, and whether the right hon. Gentleman will state the intentions of the Government in reference to enlarging the period?
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : I am informed by the learned County Court Judge that the report in the  Sheffield Independent
 MR. THEODORE FRY : Does the right hon. Gentleman intend to take any steps to ascertain the need for relief?
 MR. THEODORE FRY  (Darlington) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he has come to any conclusion in reference to the extension of the railway from Loughrea to Woodford, which has been brought before his notice by memorial and deputation from the district, and which would not only provide work but be a great permanent boon to that isolated district? I also beg to ask the right hon. Gentleman if he is aware that only a small proportion of the men on Achill Island have been given relief work, and if it is his intention to increase the number so employed, or to distribute assistance in other ways, they and their families being on the verge of starvation; and, if it be true that only about one-fourth of the needful quantity of seed potatoes have been applied for, that a good many of these have been found to be rotten, and that, in many cases, the good ones are being consumed for food; and, if so, whether he can take any steps to remedy this state of things?
 SIR THOMAS ESMONDE  (Dublin County, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he can explain why, although the subscribers to the Constabulary Force Fund have repeatedly pressed for an account of the income and expenditure of that fund, no such account has ever been rendered; what was the amount of the Force Fund in 1863, and what it amounts to now; and whether the authorities have any objection to a public audit of this public fund as requested by the Petition of the pensioners presented to this House in 1888?
 SIR THOMAS ESMONDE : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with reference to the case of Miss Quane, who has been sent to gaol in Tipperary on the charge of "hooting the police," would he explain in what the alleged crime consisted, and under what law it is punishable; upon what evidence was Miss Quane convicted; and by whom was the sentence imposed upon her?
 SIR W. LAWSON : May I ask if the right hon. Gentleman will make any further inquiry into the matter?
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : It has been complained that we sometimes speak twice on this aide. Well, Sir, I have not yet spoken on the subject which I take to be the question of our occupation of Egypt and whether certain contingencies of an evil nature in the Soudan do not arise from that occupation. I am surprised to hear a right hon. Gentleman opposite say that there are more important questions to be discussed than this. I do not think there could be a more important question discussed than this. Nobody can have forgotten how we went on and on, and employed our Fleets, Armies, in stifling Home Rule in Egypt, merely for the sake of securing the extortionate profits of a few bondholders. Can there be anything on which it is more important for everybody in this House to do all that within them lies to prevent the renewal of such crimes as have occurred. You may have a renewal of one of the greatest international outrages of the century—a foul blot on the record of the Liberal Party. The occupation of Egypt to my mind was commenced in outrage and carried on with fraud. It was to the everlasting shame of the Liberal Party that they carried out these proceedings, and I am glad to see that some of the Pashas of that Party have now arrived. I hope that they will tell the Committee that they are as much opposed to this forward policy in Egypt as any of those who sit below the Gangway. Why have our soldiers been kept in Egypt? Have we not been told over
 328
(10.52)  SIR W. LAWSON : I move, Sir, that you do now report Progress, and ask leave to sit again, and I will give my reasons for so doing. I think that this is a most extraordinary way of voting national supplies. We have been discussing as important a question as it is possible to discuss, namely, the policy of this country in Egypt. Hardly anybody on the other side of the House came to hear or take part in the discussion, but all of a sudden in comes the First Lord of the Treasury, and without having listened to the Debate for five minutes—I do not think the right hon. Gentleman even heard my speech—he gets up and moves that the question be now put. The Government even refused to answer a question I put. I put it seriously, respectfully, and earnestly, a question which arose out of the discussion then going on, namely, the policy of the Government in the Soudan, which is the cause of the necessity for voting this number of men and the amount of money asked for. I put the question seriously to the right hon. Gentleman the Minister for War, and directly I sat down, having asked the question, up jumped the First Lord of the Treasury and moved that the question be now put. Was anybody ever answered in that way in the House before? More than that; I happen to know that others wish to take part in the Debate and express their opinions on the Egyptian policy of the Government. In these circumstances I have no hesitation whatever in moving to report Progress.
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : I understand from the right hon. Gentleman that the Government proposed to legalise the  pari mutuel
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The latest published figures for England and Wales will be found on pages 239 and 242 of the last General Report laid on the Table, but the Returns for 1890 are almost ready, and will shortly be in the hands of Members.
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : No scholar over 14 is, as a rule, recognised on the registers of a day school, and no scholar under 14 can be recognised in an evening school unless he is deemed by the Department to be exempt from the legal obligation to attend school, so that it is practically impossible for any child to occupy the dual position indicated in my hon. Friend's question. It appears, however, that scholars who having passed the Fifth Standard no longer receive instruction in the obligatory subjects are, if qualified to attend an evening school, eligible to receive assistance from the County Council in respect of manual or technical instruction.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : I believe the difficulty, which at one time existed, has been largely diminished, partly owing to increase in the number of village halls available for the purpose which the hon. Member has in view, and partly owing to the general desire on the part of managers of schools to meet all reasonable requirements in this connection, and I do not, therefore, as at present advised, see any necessity for further legislation of the character suggested.
 VISCOUNT WOLMER  (Hants, Petersfield) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War how many soldiers of the Foot Guards are now stationed in London, and how many of these each day are not

 MR. J. W. LOWTHER  (Cumberland, Penrith) : The Charity Commissioners have, within the last few days, received the Report to which the question refers. They propose to communicate it in the usual course to the Trustees and to the executors of the late assistant overseer, at the cost of whose estate the inquiry has been conducted. The Commissioners will await the receipt of observations upon the Report in the result of this communication before taking further action in the matter. There is no reason to believe that the dealings with the charity funds reported on by the accountant will result in any ultimate loss to the charities.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : In the absence of my hon. Friend (Mr. DEASY), I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if the Government engineers have approved of the making of certain projected roads, and the completion and construction of piers in Achill Island; and why the works have not been commenced? I beg also to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether his attention has been called to the distress alleged to exist in Achill; that many of the inhabitants are on the brink of starvation; whether he is aware that only a small proportion of the Islanders have had relief work given them, these being obliged, in numerous instances, to travel very long-distances to and from work; that the supply of seed potatoes has run short; that many of them have been found to be rotten, and that in many cases the good ones have been consumed for food; and whether any steps will be taken to remedy the alleged faults in relief of distress in Achill?
 DR. TANNER : What piers are being-made in connection with the Island of Achill?
 DR. TANNER : None! The people are to be allowed to starve and die.
 DR. TANNER (in the absence of Mr. SEXTON) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the employment of unskilled labour on that part of the Collooney and Claremorris Railway, in the Swynford Union, is about to cease; and what further provision the Government intend to make with a view to provide work for the destitute in this the most congested district in Ireland?
 DR. TANNER : May I call the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that he has in no way answered the first paragraph of the question, which is, whether the employment of unskilled labour is about to cease?
 DR. TANNER : I really regret to have to meet these impertinent answers——
 DR. TANNER (in the absence of Mr. SEXTON) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General on what grounds is payment in full for Sunday duty in the Dublin Post Office withheld from hall porters, bag officers, yard officers, postmen, and labourers, and only paid to sorters; if it is the fact that a Treasury Minute was issued last July, 1890, for payment in full for all grades performing Sunday duty; and will he have an order made to the Dublin authorities to likewise pay the officers referred to above, the same as has been granted to sorters dating from last July?
 DR. TANNER (in the absence of Sir THOMAS ESMONDE) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether complaints have reached him that the sacks in which the supply of seed potatoes, which are to be sold at 1s. a stone, sent to Ballinore were found to contain a considerable quantity of clay, and that many of the potatoes were utterly unfit for seed; and, whether, in view of the poverty of the district, and the absolute necessity of the potato crop being sown this month, the Government will take immediate steps to ensure that a sufficient supply of sound potato seed is supplied to the people, and at a price they can afford to pay?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the resolution forwarded to him by the Grand Jury of the County Clare, strongly recommending the making and maintenance of a light railway between Ennis and Scariff, has been received, and whether any steps will be taken to carry out the recommendation?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether any, and, if so, what relief works are intended to be instituted in the Kanturk Union for the relief of labourers in the district?
 DR. TANNER : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the gentlemen who are under the Poor Law Board have made repeated visits and reported unfavourably upon the condition of the labourers in this district?
 DR. TANNER : If it is clearly shown that the people are in a very bad condition—starving condition—will something be done?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland what relief works have been started in the famine-stricken district of South Castlehaven and Toehead; how many people have been employed, and what sum of money has been disbursed in such relief; and how much of this money is being paid to relief agents, and how much to the people requiring relief?
 DR. TANNER : Can the Chief Secretary say how much of this money has been paid to relief agents, and how much to the persons requiring relief?
 DR. TANNER : How soon can I get an answer?
 DR. TANNER : I will put it down for Monday.
(7.5.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : This I think is an opportune time to ask the House to consider the present system of administration and legislation for the different parts of the Empire, and to consider, not in a Party spirit, a possible solution of the problem of devolution. I think the subject ought to be considered and might be considered outside the spirit of Party, and in that view I find the leaders of different Parties agree. The noble Lord the leader of the Tory Party especially I may mention. He, in his speech at Newport five years ago, claimed that it had always been the contention of the Tory Party that people in their own localities should govern themselves, and that they should be encouraged to take an active interest in the administration of their own affairs. He pointed out that there might be weaknesses in the Local Authorities, but the wisdom of a largo Central Authority would correct the failures and mistakes of each. It was the sort of speech we might expect from an advocate of federalism. Three years ago the noble Lord the Member for Rossendale (Lord Hartington) spoke upon the subject, and said that in addition to County Boards perhaps some larger authorities—perhaps National Local Authorities—should be erected for England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham (Mr. Chamberlain) proposed a scheme at the same time very much on the same lines. I think under these circumstances, since all parties in the House have expressed themselves more or less favourably towards the
 441 442 443 444 vis inertiœ 445 "Simple repealers are of opinion that a reconstituted Irish Parliament should have precisely the same power and authority as the former Irish Parliament had. Federalists, on the contrary, appear to me to require more for Ireland than simple repealers do, for besides a local Parliament having full practical local authority, Federalists require that for the consideration of Imperial questions, colonial, military, and naval questions, and the lines of foreign policy in a Federal Parliament, Ireland should have a fair share of representative power. It is but right and just to confess that in that respect Federalists would give Ireland more weight and importance in Imperial concerns than would be acquired by a policy of simple repeal. For my own part I own"— "that since I have come to contemplate the specific differences, such as they are, between simple repeal and Federalism, I do at present feel a preference for the Federal plan, as tending more to the utility of the Irish connection with England than simple repeal."
 DR. CLARK : Mr. Davitt is undoubtedly a Federalist. This is a question that depends as much upon Irish opinion in America as upon Irish opinion at home. I think that all the active members of the Irish Party, all the prominent leaders in America, are quite satisfied that Federalism is the proper solution of the Irish difficulty. In the States recently I saw some of the extreme men, and I have known some of them for the last 20 years. I met them during the Fenian times, and among those of the extreme men I met in America last year, and who have been Fenians, there was not one who would not be content with a Federal system for Ireland, that country having the management of her own affairs in a manner similar to that enjoyed by each State under the American Union. I take it, then, that a form of Federal devolution would be acceptable to Ireland, while the Imperial Parliament would be relieved to give attention to important Imperial concerns. Undoubtedly any Government that takes this question in hand will meet with strong support from Irishmen. There will be a strong Irish agitation in the next Parliament, and if there are fewer Home Rule Members returned for Ireland there will be more Scotch Home Rule Members. We can get rid of agitation if we proceed to dispassionately consider a system of devolution. I have put my Resolution in a somewhat vague form advisedly. It may be that the Welsh people do not require what the Scotch and Irish people require. Scotland and Ireland have had Parliaments in the past, but the Welsh difficulty may be solved by means of a Grand Committee. There are some English Members who think that the Imperial Parliament should remain as at present, and that Scotch and Irish Members should devote themselves to local matters in their own countries, while English Members occupy the first part of the
 447 448 "—the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle flags were furled. In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. There the common sense of most shall hold a fretiul realm in awe, And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law."
*(4.0.)  MR. P. STANHOPE  (Wednesbury) : I rise for the purpose of moving,
 "That this House declines to proceed with the consideration of a scheme for the revision of Railway Rates which is based upon the full recognition of the legality of Station Terminal Charges, with respect to which the Standing Committee on Trade expressly refrained from formulating any opinion." 387 388 389 v "I think it may be of service to point out that the Board of Trade proposals would be most unfair. Take Class C, in which grain of or over two tons' loads would be carried. The station terminals proposed are 2s. per ton—result, two tons would pay 4s., while eight tons would pay 16s. The cost to the Railway Company for the station terminals would be the same whether the load was two tons or eight tons, yet, while 4s. would be earned by the companies in one case, they would receive four times as much in the latter. To propose to give a Railway Company 16s. for placing a truck in position for loading and unloading with the value of the ground for the time allowed for each consignment seems to me to be absurd, and I am surprised that such a monstrous proposal should be dreamed of by the Board of Trade. There are many instances on the North-Eastern Railway where the grain rate for four-ton lots does not exceed 2s. per ton
 390 "That there seemed to he an apprehension that Railway Companies would be able to make not only their existing rates and charges, but terminals  plus "That was not his intention, and if there was any danger of that he would accept words to deal with the matter." "That it remains the law until it is upset; it remained the law when Parliament was legislating in 1888." 391
 MR. P. STANHOPE : In a small minority of articles.
 MR. P. STANHOPE : Not in Scotland.
*(6.30.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : With the permission of the House I will state the reasons why I think I may now withdraw the Amendment. I would, first, ask the right hon. Gentleman to give us an assurance that he will give us an opportunity of discussing the constitution of the Committee on some favourable opportunity, and before any decision is taken in the matter. I

(5.55.)  MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I will appeal to my hon. Friend the Member for Forfarshire (Mr. Barclay) not to press his Motion for Adjournment. I have listened to a considerable part of this Debate. I heard the speech of the hon. Member for Somersetshire, but was unable to hear that of the President of the Board of Trade in consequence of my being engaged elsewhere. I may, however, say that while I agree with a good deal of what has been said, I think that the question under discussion is essentially one for the consideration of the Committee. I know of no question more difficult or more complicated, or which requires more careful investigation and judgment than that which it is now
 415
 MR. MUNDELLA : I was only pointing out that the Board of Trade exercise a very important influence in these matters. I hope the House will let the Bills go to a Committee as soon as possible.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : To correct some possible misunderstanding on the part of the hon. and gallant Member, I would point out that there is no Statute-such as that mentioned in the question.
 435
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am peculiarly unfortunate this evening in my endeavour to make myself understood by the hon. Gentleman. I believe all this money has been given to persons to whom it is intended relief should be given.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Relief works, consisting of road making, have been proceeding in the district mentioned since 10th February last. Between that date and 28th February the daily average number of persons employed on those works was 72. The amount paid in wages was £68 1s. 11d. On 28th February the number of persons employed bad increased to 94.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : If relief works are necessary they will be started.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have said the condition of the Union is receiving attention.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The condition of Kanturk Union is receiving careful attention. It has not so far been found necessary to open relief works there.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The resolution referred to has not been received. I may, however, say that, having regard to the large sum of money already provided by Parliament for the construction of railways in Ireland, I do not consider this a case in which. Government could ask for a special grant from Parliament.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The district named cannot be identified.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I answered the question quite fully.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : On some parts of the line of the railway mentioned, the earthworks are being gradually completed. On other parts, however, of it there is still a good deal to be done, and arrangements are in progress for concentrating the labour at these points. In this way it is hoped that consider-
 428
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : None.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : With regard to these two questions, I beg to refer the hon. Member to my reply of yesterday to a similar question put by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Darlington.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. SPEAKER : Does the hon. Gentleman withdraw his Motion?
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! The right hon. Gentleman must recollect that this is a Motion for Adjournment.
*(3.29.)  MR. SPEAKER : The proper form would be to instruct the Committee to insert clauses to carry out the views of the hon. Member. The first part of the Instruction, which explains the reasons for submitting it, is unusual.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. WINTERBOTHAM : From the proposals of last summer.
*(4.20.)  MR. WINTERBOTHAM  (Gloucester, Cirencester) : In seconding the Resolution, I have only a few words to add to the able remarks with which my hon. Friend has introduced the sub-
 392 393 394
 MR. CHARLES ACLAND  (Cornwall, Launceston) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he will consider the claims of those Inland Revenue officers who are employed in such extra departmental duties as the collection of agricultural statistics for the Board of Trade to some remuneration for their services, in addition to their salaries received for their services in the Department in which they are regularly employed?
(6.14.)  MR. C. W. GRAY  (Essex, Maldon) : I will not detain the House by going into the various points which have been raised; I wish to enter my protest in the firmest way I am able against that part of the Bill which deals with terminals. I am disappointed to find anything of the sort in the Bill. I had thought that after what occurred two years ago that question was dead and buried. But there is one detail in the Bill of some importance. The Railway Companies ask to be enabled to charge 1s. for every truck that is lime-washed or cleaned. I believe that that is an innovation.
 MR. GRAY : The same reply might be given to every criticism. I entirely disagree with the proposal to enable
 419
 MR. GRAY : That is what I was coming to. I have to decide whether I will vote with my Party or with the hon. Member opposite. If the Government will give me an assurance that they, as a Government, will use no undue influence in the Committee, then I will vote for the Second Reading with great pleasure. If Government influence is to be used in respect to the question of terminals and other charges, the traders and agriculturists will have very little chance of getting their way. If, however, the Committee are to deal with these questions with a free hand, then I hope the Amendment will be withdrawn.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : I have made inquiry on the subject, and the Index referred to was, I am informed, omitted on the ground of time and cost. I agree as to the great utility of a full Index, and I will arrange that such an Index shall be prepared in connection with the next Census Returns.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I do not know what opinions Mr. Bradlaugh held on the subject of vaccination at the time of his death, but I had confidence in his independence and judgment, and felt he might be relied upon to give full weight to the evidence produced before the Commission. I have been in communication with more than one gentleman recently with a view to filling the vacancy caused by Mr. Bradlaugh's death, but am not yet in a position to make any announcement to the House on the subject.
 *MR. RITCHIE : Yes; I am aware it was the case, and I feel that in selecting some one in his place I am bound to give weight to that consideration.
 MR. HOWARD VINCENT  (Sheffield, Central) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the Copyright Bill has actually passed the Congress of the United States, and whether it contains the provision that American copyright shall only be granted to books deposited before publication with the Librarian of Congress, printed from type set within the limits of the United States, or from plates made there from, and that, during the existence of such copyright, the importation of any such book or edition thereof not made from type set within the limits of the United States is prohibited; and, in such case, bearing in mind the renewed declaration of the Prime Minister on 4th March
 437
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether it is intended to give effect this year to the oft-repeated assurances made to the officers of the Scottish Fishery Board that some increase would be made to their salaries in view of the greatly increased duties which have been laid upon them of recent years?
 *MR. CHANNING : The right hon. Gentleman is aware that Mr. Bradlaugh was accepted as a representative of those who are opposed to compulsory vaccination?
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board what steps have been taken for selecting and nominating a member of the Royal Commission on Vaccination in the place of Mr. Brad-laugh; and whether, having regard to the importance of securing throughout the inquiry, so far as may be, an adequate representation of those out of whose complaint the Commission has arisen, he will advise the immediate nomination of a suitable parson to fill the vacancy holding the general opinions on the question held by the late Mr. Bradlaugh?
 MR. CHANNING : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury when the Motion will be made for the re-appointment of the Select Committee on Town Holdings?
*(6.1.)  MR. GROTRIAN  (Hull, E.) : This is a very important question, and it seems to me that we are in danger of not being able adequately to discuss it by the intervention of this Motion for Adjournment. As you, Sir, pointed out to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Sheffield, he was unable to deal with points having a most important bearing on the questions at issue. I am in the same position. I hope the hon. Member will not press the Motion for Adjournment; but if he does, teat it will not meet with support, and we shall be able to resume the discussion after the Division.
(6.5.)  MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S.E.) : I am obliged to trouble the House with a very few words. I represent a constituency where the agricultural depression has reached its lowest depth. There the farmers manage to eke out a pre-carious existence by sending milk to the London markets. If this Bill passes into law that trade will be knocked on the head. An hon. Member opposite has rather understated the case. Now, a 12-
 417
 MAJOR RASCH : The Great Eastern Bill will enable the charge to be raised 140 per cent., to say nothing of the cost of returning empties. At the present moment there are absolutely no terminal charges, but if the Bill becomes law there will be a terminal charge of 6d. for each 12-gallon tin. The result will be ruinous to the Essex farmers, and London will be supplied with iced milk from Holland or else will have to depend on London milk produced under the most adverse and deleterious circumstances. The Essex farmers may be divided into two categories: those who are ruined and those who will be ruined by the passing of this Bill, for it will prove the last straw on the back of the agricultural camel. No doubt we shall have the usual procession of railway directors who will tell us that these charges are only a matter of form. But the President of the Board of Trade, in the Debate on the Cheap Freights Bill, admitted that the tendency of Railway Companies was, in course of time, to reach the maximum charges; and if such rates as these are put into the Bill my constituents will refuse to look on them as a matter of form.
(6.27.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : I rise to express my views in response to the appeals which have been addressed to me from the other side of the House. Hon. members representing agricultural constituencies seem to be under a misapprehension. It is said that no terminals are charged at the present time; but it is forgotten that Railway Companies can charge anything they like for the carriage of milk, and they need not carry milk at all unless they like to to do so. Now it is proposed to make it obligatory to carry the milk, and the charges are limited to a certain maximum. As far as the Government proposals go, they are clearly a gain to the farmer. There may be objections of detail; but those who have such objections to urge, should make their voices heard in the Committee. I hope that they will do so, and their representations will receive every consideration. Expressing my opinion as an individual, I think it to their interest to send these Bills to a Committee.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : The Select Committee on Forestry made two recommendations: (a) The creation of a Board of Forestry; (b) the establishment of a School of Forestry in more than one centre. But the powers of the Board of Agriculture under the Act which created that Department are strictly limited as follows:—The Board may undertake (1) the preparation of statistics and making of inquiries relating to Forestry. (2) The inspection of schools in which technical instruction is given in connection with Forestry. (3) The aiding of any such school and of any system of lectures or instruction connected with Forestry. The Board has, therefore, no means of giving effect directly to the recommendations. But we are doing what we can within our

 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will ascertain from the Coroner for Westminster, and state whether the name "Francis Charles Hastings Russell" was or was not used in administering the oath to the jury at the inquest upon the late Duke of Bedford; and, if not, what name or names were used?
 MR. COBB : Will the right hon. Gentleman say whether the name I gave yesterday was not what was commonly called the full name?
 MR. COBB : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he is aware that that is not the name of the deceased?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that in neighbourhoods where the post offices are closed at or about 8 o'clock in the evening many licensed victuallers are in the habit of obliging their customers by
 436
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am advised that Middlesex Justices are not disqualified from acting as Justices in that county merely by the fact that they reside not in Middlesex, but in the county of London. If any reasonable legal doubt exists on the point, the matter can be tested in the Courts of Law.
 MR. MATTHEWS : That is a totally different question, which the hon. Member has not yet put to me.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am afraid the hon. Gentleman is a much greater master of English than I am. I cannot conceive that the full name "Francis Charles Hastings Russell" can mean anything but "Francis Charles Hastings Russell."
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I can add nothing to the answer which I gave last night, and which is perfectly clear and explicit—that the jury were sworn to the full name and title of the deceased person.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I think it is 1874.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Lunacy Commissioners that no Magistrate signed a certificate in this case; but Mr. Pennington, a Justice for London, appointed under the Lunacy Act, 1890, made an order on February 28 for the confinement in the Priory, a private asylum, upon certificates signed by Drs. Bond and Savage, who examined the lady at the asylum on the 25th inst., by authority of her husband,
 434
 MR. MATTHEWS : The headnote was prefixed to the Return in consequence of my having reason to believe that the provisions of Section 36 of the Licensing Acts, 1874, are not strictly observed. It often happens that changes of ownership, after a licence is first granted, are not stated either by the applicants for renewal or by the new owners, and that the name of a person who has ceased to be the owner continues on the register. I propose to issue a circular to the Licensing Justices calling their attention to the matter.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to state that by Treasury Minute of July last, payment for Sunday duty was authorised in the case of sorting clerks and telegraphists. No such authority has been granted as regards other classes of Post Office servants, whose case is now under consideration.
 *MR. RAIKES : Beyond the occasional isolated cases of loss or delay which necessarily occur when a large mass of correspondence has to be dealt with, I have received no complaints of the miscarriage of letters between this country and Melbourne. But if the hon. Member will furnish me with particulars I will cause inquiry to be made.
*(6.9.)  SIR HUSSEY VIVIAN  (Swansea, District) : I do not rise to support the Amendment of my hon. Friend, nor to detain the House, except for a few minutes. We have heard a great deal about injury to the agricultural interest, but little has been said with reference to the hardships that will be inflicted on commercial interests. Looking to the district which I represent, I fail to see the justice of the proposals made by the Board of Trade. The Great Western Railway Company will be enabled, if they are carried, to charge on the South Wales portion of its system 35 per cent more than it charges on any other portion of its system. Why should that be allowed? It may be said the maximum rates were originally fixed so high because the railway was made at a time when the district was not so fully developed as it has since become; it is now one of the most important portions of the Great Western system, and there is no longer any
 418
(6.3.)  MR. H. T. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN  (Kent, Faversham) : I was strongly impressed by the arguments of the hon. Member for Forfarshire, and agreed with him that there was good reason for the Adjournment of the Debate; but after the speeches of the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Brightside Division of Sheffield. I feel convinced the more desirable course to pursue would be to send the Bills quickly to a Committee. Therefore, I hope the Motion for an adjournment will be withdrawn.
*(6.4.)  MR. BARCLAY : After the expressions of opinion to which I have listened, I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Motion.
 *MR. BARCLAY : No, Sir; I press the Adjournment.
*(5.52.)  MR. BARCLAY  (Forfarshire) : Sir, I think the House will arrive at a just conclusion as to the proper mode of dealing with this Bill and other Bills now before the House, by recalling the circumstances which led to their introduction. The Railway Rates Committee of 1881, appointed to investigate the complaints of traders, and especially of farmers, who alleged that they were overcharged for short distances on noncompetitive lines, ascertained that those complaints were well founded. In defence, the Railway Companies asserted that they were entitled to make an indefinite charge for station terminals. It was clearly shown before the Committee that in respect of long distance and non-competitive traffic the companies were not exceeding their maximum rates; and that the maximum rates in such cases were practically valueless. The Railway Companies could not charge anything like the maximum rates. The addition of station terminals provided by the Bill will have the effect of making maximum rates for short distance traffic equally valueless.
 *MR. BARCLAY : I am quite willing to admit the rates may be lower, but it has been shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Wednesbury that with the addition of station terminals the maximum for hay would be higher than it was before. And in regard to milk, the hon. Member for Crewe has

*(6.33.)  MR. BARCLAY : I wish to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether petitioners will be heard individually by the Committee, or whether they will have to appear by counsel?
 *MR. BARCLAY : Why should not a petitioner be entitled to state his own case? An individual trader would have to incur enormous expense if he appeared by counsel.
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can give any information regarding the serious disturbances which are reported by telegraph to have occurred quite recently near Van, and the attack which is said to have been made upon the British Consulate in that city?
 MR. BRYCE : Have the Foreign Office made any inquiry?
 MR. BRYCE : But the right hon. Gentleman has not answered my question. Are not the Foreign Office in the habit, when reports of this kind are made, of inquiring whether our Representative has received information?
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether he is aware that a recent Fiar's Court for Wigtownshire fixed the supposed price for Bore (or Bear) for crop and year 1890, although this variety of barley has for a considerable period ceased to be grown in the county; whether it is lawful for the Fiar's Court to fix a price for Bere where no Bere is grown in the county; and whether the parish minister is entitled to claim the price of barley instead?
 DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Homo Department if his attention has been called to the seizure of Mrs. Mary Cathcart, of Wootton Hall, Stafford; if he will disclose the name of the Magistrate who with Drs. Bond and Savage are alleged to have signed a certificate for her confinement in a private lunatic asylum; if he will state when and where the doctors examined Mrs. Cathcart; and if he will call upon the Lunacy Commissions to disclose the name of the person or persons by whose authority they made such examination and signed such certificate?
 *MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The Secretary for Scotland has been in communication with the Scottish Fishery Board on the question of the salaries of the fishery officers. The final letter from the Board was received on the 26th February last, and the Secretary for Scotland is now in a position to lay his proposals before the Treasury.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : It is the case that a Court for Wigtownshire struck a price for Bere for the crop 1890, thus following the practice in that county for many years, with the exception of the year 1889. I am informed that the quantity of Bere grown in this county is very small, but that it is not known to have altogether ceased. The question of whether or not to include a product in the Fiar's prices appears to be one for the Jury, who return their verdict on the evidence or their own proper knowledge. If Bere is an inferior quality of barley, the minister would, I think, be entitled to claim the highest Fiars prices for that article.
*(8.31.)  MR. SOMERVELL  (Ayr, &c.) : It appears to me that the sting of the Motion now before the House is in its tail. There has been some discussion as to who is responsible for the alteration from its original form, but I think I can trace in it the hand of the hon. Member for Hanley. The Motion says—
 "It is desirable to devolve upon the Representatives of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales respectively the management and control of their domestic affairs."
 MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle-on-Tyne) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury what business he proposes to take on Monday and next week?
 MR. J. MORLEY : The right hon. Gentleman will permit me to remind him that there was rather an understanding that due notice should be given as to when the Irish Vote was intended to
 439
 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when the works under the Relief of Distress (Ireland) Act will be commenced in the Tuam Union, and if he can now name the works to be executed, or else the parishes or districts in which they will be undertaken?
 MR. HOWARD  (Middlesex, Tottenham) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether he will consider the desirability of introducing a Bill to extend "The Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884," so as to make its provisions applicable to elections of Vestry Clerks and other parochial officials who are elected by open Parochial Vestry or poll of a parish?
 MR. HOWARD : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the jurisdiction at Quarter Sessions of the existing Middlesex Magistrates is reserved to them by "The Local Government Act, 1888," as fully as if resident in that county, though they may be residing actually in the county of London?
(3.40.)  MR. COURTNEY : The hon. Member for North St. Pancras (Mr. T. H. Bolton) has expressed disappointment that more good has not resulted from the previous discussion of this subject. My difficulty is in knowing what the Committee have done in the matter.
 MR. COURTNEY : That is what I anticipated, and in view of that fact I consider the Instruction premature. I would advise the hon. and learned Gentleman to wait until the Committee have finished their labours, and then when the Bill comes again before the House, if no notice has been taken of his suggestion, he can once more raise the point. I certainly deprecate the interpretation which the hon. Member for North St. Pancras has put upon the remarks which fell from me the other day. I said that the subject was an important one, and that it deserved full consideration, but I do not think I anticipated in any degree what the result of that consideration would be. All I expressed was my own view that if it was desired to make a revenue out of the undertaking the proper thing would be to provide some sliding scale in respect of rates, so that the fares might be reduced as the profits of the undertaking increased. I had no intention of speaking of the working classes alone; I had everybody in view. As the matter is still before a Committee I should strongly deprecate the giving of a mandatory Instruction or doing anything that would interfere with the deliberation of the Committee.
 MR. COURTNEY  (Cornwall, Bodmin) : There may be a little difficulty in reference to the third Bill.
(6.25.)  MR. MARK J. STEWART  (Kirkcudbright) : I think that the sooner these Bills are sent to the Joint Committee the better it will be for all concerned. I can only say, with regard to the high rates contained in the Schedules, that hitherto traders in the South of Scotland have escaped these very high rates. We now send milk to London at 1½d. a gallon without any terminal charges. It is most important that these advantages should be continued, as, according to the charges in the Schedule, the cost of carriage will be 1s. 3d. a gallon—a considerable difference for the London consumer to sustain. I am in no way antagonistic to the interests of the Railway Companies. I know that theirs are enormous undertakings in
 421
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Arrangements will be made whereby all Petitions presented within live clear days of the sitting of the Committee will be heard. Further arrangements are already in progress between the Chambers of Agriculture and other bodies that all these interests shall be represented.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : In the ordinary way.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Petitioners will have precisely the same right as they have before an ordinary private Committee of this House.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has ever sat on a Private Bill Committee, but the same course will be pursued before this Committee as before an ordinary Private Bill Committee.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : If the object of the hon. Gentleman who has just spoken was merely to move the Adjournment of the Debate, I would suggest, with all deference, that he might have made that proposal without speaking at the length he has; but, as the Motion has been made, I would ask the House to consider the position in which the matter now stands. It is obvious that the Joint Committee of the two Houses to which these Bills are to be referred, and to which the Act of Parliament says we should refer them, will have a very long and difficult task before them. If they are able to
 414
*(6.19.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : It is an important point that the hon. Member should know that the Committee will be distinctly a judicial tribunal, absolutely free from any influence on the part of the Government. My sole duty, when the Provisional Orders come back from the Committee, will be to carry out the decisions of the Committee.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : My hon. Friend forgets that the tribunal to which this question will be referred is entirely beyond my control.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The hon. Member does not understand the Bill. It reduces the maximum rates for short distances in respect of non-competitive traffic.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : No.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : It is included in the ordinary charges now.
*(4.30.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : In the year 1888 Parliament thought fit to impose a very severe and arduous responsibility on the Board of Trade. It is not possible to exaggerate the difficulty of the task imposed on the Board of Trade by Section 24 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of that year. I am, of course, responsible for proposing it to Parliament; but I have very frankly to admit that if I had known what I know now of the extreme difficulty of the work I should have hesitated before I made such a proposal. It imposed not only the task—which in itself would have been sufficient—of codifying the railway rates and charges authorised by something like 900 different Acts of Parliament, and for 970 different Railway Companies; and of reducing chaos to order by enabling the trader and the agriculturist to know what services the rates were charged for, and whether they were legally charged—a thing which no man without
 395 396
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : No, in a large number. But the main point of the hon. Member's objection is that we have allowed the principle of station terminals. In the hon. Member for Cirencester's (Mr. Winterbotham's) remarks upon station terminals for milk and other perishable articles, he entirely omitted—as many others have done—to consider that actual rates ought not to be compared with maximum rates. That is a very elementary part of this problem, which does not even seem to have presented itself to the hon.
 397
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Quite so. The Chamber considers the rate still excessive. But in this matter it seems to represent the views of those persons who, like the hon. Member, wish to take the lowest rate at which milk is carried at present, and to compel the Railway Companies to carry it at that rate, with a small addition of 5 or 10 per cent. as a maximum. Who can say that the price of milk will not be very considerably raised in future? Milk is not an article—and I do not think it will be—which is the subject of competition from abroad. Who can say that the cost of conveyance may not be very materially increased as compared with what it is at the present moment? We have taken these matters into consideration; and in fixing a maximum we have adopted the figures named in the schedule, believing that the companies will work within that maximum, as they have hitherto done, for the advantage of the farmers and the public in building up a trade which they have established without any maximum at all. They will not be so foolish as to hinder or to stop the development of
 398 "In every case the maximum rates and charges should be deemed to include all terminal
 399 "It appeared there was an apprehension that the Railway Companies would be enabled to make not only their existing maximum rates and charges but terminals,  plus
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The hon. Baronet is mistaken as to the charge in such cases.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I think any one who examines the different Acts on the subject will see that—if it be admitted that the decisions which have already been given were right—in the great majority of cases, at any rate, the law will enable the companies to make these charges. They do make them at present, and they are paid by the traders. Those were the facts with which I had to deal. I felt that, although for this reason it was just to accept the principle of station terminals,
 400 401
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I have seen the pamphlet to which the hon. Member refers, but I do not know what facilities could be afforded by the Government which are not at the disposal of those who are interested in such a scheme.
(3.32.)  MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I rise for the purpose of opposing the Instruction. I took the liberty of saying, when the subject was under discussion before, that I thought the raising of the question was not in the interest of the London County Council. I now understand that the Committee have decided that, although there may be value in the subsoil, that value belongs by law to the frontagers. The view I take of the matter is that there is no value at all in the subsoil at such a depth, and therefore that no payment is due to anybody. Whatever the traffic may be, either under or over the roadways, the public gets the full benefit of it. The principle that the travelling public should pay towards the taxation of London is, to my mind, an utterly wrong one. It would be better for the public interests that the Local Authorities should maintain all the highways in order that the people should be able to travel cheaply. We have lately been dealing with the question of market rights and tolls, whereby provisions brought in for the consumption of the community are made to pay taxes. That is a vicious and exploded fallacy, and certainly ought not to be applied to railways and subways. What we want is that the localities should take national undertakings of this kind into their own hands, make the subways, and derive all the profit that can be obtained from them. It is right that they should be maintained by the public money, but not as a legislative source of taxation. What was said by the Chairman of Committees on the last occasion possesses great weight and authority, namely, that in granting a monopoly the Committee should see that the fares were as low as possible,
 384
 MR. ESSLEMONT : I have no doubt that without any Instruction at all the; Committee would do its duty and provide minimum fares for the working classes.
 MR. ESSLEMONT : I have had the subject before me on three occasions.
(6.22.)  MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I only wish before a decision is taken to point out to the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade, whose fairness and anxious attention to this Bill we all desire to acknowledge, that the question of terminals will go up to the Committee with his strongly expressed opinion in favour of terminals. I believe that those who represent agricultural constituencies have no objection to the recognition of the principle of some extra payment in respect of short distances, but we strongly object to the companies getting besides an additional allowance for such distances the power of charging terminals. Our complaint is that small traders in isolated districts are taken advantage of by the Railway Companies, and therefore the maximum ought to be kept so low as to protect these traders. I join with the hon. Baronet the Member for Swansea in hoping that the Amendment will be withdrawn, as a Division would prejudice our case before the Committee
(6.29.)  MR. ESSLEMONT : Must those who wish to raise these points appear at their own expense by counsel before the Select Committee, or will it be at the expense of the Government?
 MR. HANBURY : Perhaps I may be allowed to explain that the difficulty of the Committee was in having no official knowledge of anything that had taken place in the House on the matter. That is why no attention has been devoted to it. But it is not too late to look into the question; and if the Instruction is forced upon us, we must consider the matter.
 MR. HANBURY  (Preston) : The hon. Gentleman has somewhat exaggerated the facts in regard to the syndicate. The evidence before the Committee shows that some of these gentlemen are prepared to put in very large sums, and to retain their holdings.
 MR. HANBURY : The Committee have not practically reached this question yet. It can only come up upon the clauses of the Bill, and we have only just begun to consider them.
 Mr. HANBURY  (Preston) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War what alterations have recently been made in the system of payment by the War Office to Army agents, and what are the precise duties which Army agents will in future perform for the War Office, and on what terms their remuneration is to be fixed?
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : I am afraid that I must take a Division upon the Instruction.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : That fact rather strengthens my case. The fact that the financiers who form the syndicate propose to retain their shares shows the value of the concession, and makes it more necessary that we should secure to the public full compensation the rights granted. I have no wish to throw cold water on the efforts of the promoters, and I move this Instruction without any hostility whatever to these railways. I have no interest in the matter except the public interest, and I have no wish to impose conditions which would prevent the railways from being made, or seriously embarrass the promoters. It is, however, such a good thing that I think they can well afford to give the public some substantial return for the large powers they are asking for. I beg to move the Instruction which I have placed on the Paper.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : I was mentioning that the promoters take a most sanguine view of the prospects of these tunnel railways, and expect the undertaking to he enormously profitable. One of the companies proposes to provide facilities for carrying as many as 350,000 persons a day, and the railway which is already in operation from London Bridge to Stockwell, and which is admittedly not in a perfect condition, with unsatisfactory stations and approaches, has carried in a little over two months, 900,000 passengers. At a recent meeting the company owning that railway expressed the greatest satisfaction at the financial as well as the engineering results of the undertaking. Therefore, from actual experience in connection with the experiment of the South London Railway, there is conclusive evidence that the privilege asked for is one of enormous value. That being so, I think it is the duty of the House to take care that the public interests are very well looked after. The other night, in a discussion which occurred here, there was a general consensus of opinion as to the desirability of legislation in reference to providing cheap trains at convenient hours for the working classes. When the Railway Passenger Duty was partially remitted, in the interests of the public the House insisted on compensation being given in the shape of an increased number of workmen's trains, and now, when a far more valuable concession is about to be handed over to a Private Company, it is time to give practical effect to our opinions, and to extend a policy which has been recognised and affirmed over and over again. The people promoting these railways are a syndicate of financiers. I believe they call themselves "The Exploration Company, Limited," and they want to get a concession out of which they expect to make money.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : The Instruction only directs the Committee to make provision for cheap fares.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : I shall be most happy to move the Instruction in the form suggested by you, Sir.
*(3.10.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I rise for the purpose of moving an Instruction to the Committee
 "That, in order that the public shall derive some definite advantage in return for the right to tunnel under the public streets proposed to be conferred by the Bill, that they (the Committee) do insert clauses in the Bill providing either (1) for payment to the Local Authority of a royalty or share of earnings after interest on capital and working expenses; or (2) for specially reduced fares on certain trains between hours most convenient for the working classes and for clerks and others engaged in business, the Railway Company being required to run a specified number of such trains daily." 379 380
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope to put a notice as to the re-appointment of the Town Holdings Committee on the Paper within the next few days.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : We have no official knowledge of the measure, and only know from the newspapers that it has been passed. It is quite impossible for me to express any opinion respecting its provisions until we see them. I do not know what changes may have been made in the Bill during its passage through Congress, and I am, therefore, quite unable to indicate what would be the policy or action of the Government with respect to it.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Well, we will say definitely that Irish Supplementary Estimates will be taken on Thursday.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I think we shall begin with the Irish Supplementary Vote on Monday. I hope we may get the Navy Supplementary Votes to-night, but if not we shall proceed with them on Monday following with the Irish Supplementary Vote—or, as my right hon. Friend suggests, if the Navy Votes take any considerable time, it might be well to postpone the Irish Vote until Thursday. But Supply-Supplementary Votes will be the business next week.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I have no knowledge as to the accuracy of the figures the hon. Gentleman quotes in his question, but I have to say the Government will carefully consider all suggestions that may be made to them as to the constitution of the Royal Commission on Labour.
*(4.53.)  MR. W. MCLAREN  (Cheshire, Crewe) : The right hon. Baronet, in the course of his speech, referred to the question of the rates for the carriage of milk. I should like to say a few words on that subject, because I have been for the last year Chairman of the Special Committee of the British Dairy Farmers' Association, which has carried on almost entirely the agitation on this particular branch of the subject, and has obtained no fewer than four modifications of the proposed rates and charges—a much greater amount of success than any other trading company has achieved. We have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter, and have come to the conclusion that not merely are the rates proposed by the Board of Trade excessive, but that the whole method of charging is cumbersome and unworkable in the extreme as far as milk is concerned. The right hon. Gentleman said that the hon. Gentleman who seconded the Amendment had not taken into account the fact that the actual rates cannot be compared with the maximum rates. I do not think the hon. Member could have overlooked so obvious a fact. We all know that we are dealing with maximum rates, and we remember that they are at the company's and not at the owner's risk. But I dispute the claim of the right hon. Gentleman that he has obtained important concessions on the point, because he has only proposed to lay upon these companies a statutory obligation to do what they are now voluntarily doing; and although it is true that the Central Chamber of Agriculture admit a reduction of 33 to 40 per cent. in maximum rates, which were put at 150 per cent. above existing actual rates, the fact is that the proposed maximum rates are still 100 per cent. above these actual rates. It is computed that 2 per cent. will cover the difference between owners and companies' risk, so that this point is not really worth considering. The right hon. Gentleman has told us that if we object to his proposal we can formulate our complaints, and can Petition Parlia-
 402 403 404 "That with regard to the carriage of milk, the proposed rates shall be simplified, and shall be made a rate per gallon varying according to distance, which shall cover charges of every kind, including the return of the empty can."
 THE FINANCIAL SECRETAY TO THE WAR OFFICE (Mr. BRODRICK,  Surrey, Guildford : The alterations which will take effect from the 1st of January next are that the firms now acting as Army agents will issue the pay of officers without any charge upon the public for their commission. Messrs. Cox pay the regiments of Guards and distribute the estates of deceased soldiers. These duties it is proposed, for the public convenience, to leave in their hands.
 432
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : From the 1st of September last an increase in the scale of salaries was granted to the Excise Service, involving an additional annual cost of over £30,000, and on maximum salaries such cost would amount to something like £50,000.
 427
 MR. JACKSON : My right hon. Friend the Postmaster General has asked me to answer this question. He is not aware of the practice to which the hon. Member refers. No one is entitled to sell stamps without first taking out a licence.
 MR. JOHNSTON  (Belfast, S.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been called to the project of a ship canal, connecting the Forth and Clyde, as proposed by Mr. Charles John Wilson, of Hawick, at the meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce; whether he has seen the Report of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, of Glasgow, on a direct route from Yoker to Grangemouth, through a rich mineral district; and whether the Board of Trade can give any facilities for testing the practicability of the scheme, its probable cost, the prospects of traffic, and the likelihood of its commercial success?
 MR. MATHER  (Lancashire, S.E., Gorton) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that much dissatisfaction is felt, both in Melbourne (Australia) and this country, at the frequent miscarriage of letters to and fro; whether complaints have been made to him from time to time on the subject; and whether he can assure the House that measures are being taken to ensure the regular and safe despatch and delivery of letters in the future?
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the information in his possession on which he bases
 433
 MR. SUMMERS : The Act of 1872?
 MR. SUMMERS : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in view of the fact that out of 1,084,361 persons employed in mills and factories in the United Kingdom as many as 656,549 are females, the Government will consider the advisability of appoint-
 438
 MR. SUMMERS : The figures, I may mention, are to be found in the Blue Book.
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the hon. Member for Penrith whether the Charity Commissioners have yet received a Report from the accountant who was to inquire into matters connected with the Lambeth Charities; and, if so, whether the Local Authorities and
 425
*(3.30.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : I supported the hon. Member on the last occasion, and I very much regret that he did not carry the Motion to a Division. What has occurred since shows, I think, that it does not altogether answer to leave these matters to the chapter of accidents, and that it is better, as we cannot always trust a Committee to do what we wish, to give a definite Instruction. I agree that these railways will rapidly increase in the Metropolis, and that, therefore, the subject is one calling for serious consideration. For all practical purposes the roads are public property, and as these new companies are asking for important rights it is only fair that they should pay for them. One of
 383
 *MR. BARTLEY : I merely said that I preferred one alternative to another.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : As I have already explained to the House, while a newspaper correspondent telegraphs home news of this kind, Her Majesty's Representative will, in ordinary course, inquire into the facts, but does not telegraph the occurrence unless immediate action is required. If anything extraordinary occurs we shall hear of it in due course.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : No information has been received of these reports.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : No, Sir; when sensational telegrams appear we do not necessarily make inquiry.
 SIR JOHN LUBBOCK : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board why there was no "Index to the Population Tables" compiled for the Census of 1881, similar to that for 1871, as comprised in Parliamentary Return [C. 676 II]; and whether in view of the great utility of such an Index to all persons having occasion to consult the Population Tables, he will give instructions that such an Index shall be prepared on the lines of such Return for the approaching Census?
 SIR JOHN LUBBOCK  (London University) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he proposes to do anything, and, if so, what, to carry out the recommendations of the Select Committee on Forestry?
 SIR J. PULESTON : The Instruction, if passed, will practically command the Committee upstairs to insert these provisions, and I am afraid the result would be to throttle an important enterprise.
 SIR J. PULESTON : I think that without laying down a hard and fast line, the Committee might be able to take cognisance of this discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for North Islington (Mr. Bartley) supports the Instruction, and yet he knows that, in reference to cheap fares, it may be practically impossible to carry it out and to divide a penny into fractional parts. At the same time, he proposes to make it obligatory.
 SIR J. PULESTON : Then still greater importance attaches to the remarks of the hon. Member. The first question before the Committee is whether it is desirable that additional means of locomotion shall be established under the sanction of this House. That principle being affirmed, it is necessary to provide such increased means of locomotion, without giving an undue advantage to anybody. This Instruction commands the Committee to insert these special clauses; but a Committee now sitting upstairs have already arrived at a different decision, with full knowledge of the discussion which occurred the other day. If the Instruction is passed, it becomes an absolute command.
(3.36.)  SIR J. PULESTON : The hon. Member for Aberdeen (Mr. Esslemont) speaks with some weight and authority, having been a member of the Committee which had this subject before them last year.
 SIR J. PULESTON  (Devonport) : I am advised that the promoters of the third Bill are prepared to say that the matter

*(6.20.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE : I should like to draw attention to the milk question. The present policy is to get rid of the system of keeping cows in the cellars of London and other large towns—a system very apt to produce disease, for not only does it make the place unhealthy but the milk produced under such cir-
 420
 *SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I beg. Sir, to second the Motion.
*(5.7.)  SIR RICHARD PAGET  (Somerset, Wells) : I regard this as the most important question that has come before the House this Session. A question which deals so intimately with the conduct of the trade in the agricultural produce of the whole of the United Kingdom is a question which may well be described as of the greatest importance. Hon. Members who have to deal with matters upon a large scale may not have brought their minds to appreciate
 405 406 407 plus plus 408 inter se
 *SIR R. PAGET : I am glad to be corrected as to these terminals; but there are cases where for comparatively short distances the 1s. 6d. will be imposed as for long distances, and we have not been told the reason for this. There is a certain sweet simplicity about the arrangement that no doubt has been attractive. The farmers are strongly of opinion that the infliction of the terminal is in many cases the imposition of a new charge. This question has been so largely dealt with that I will not follow it up beyond saying that one of the objections taken the other day was this: that if Parliament passes the Bill in its present form it will seem to be a sort of indication to the Railway Companies of this kind—"You have not hitherto made charges for terminals, for return of empties, or for loading or unloading, and now these are set out as indicating

 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : I am not prepared to introduce such a Bill. As far as my information goes, there is no demand for it. In the event of a District Councils Bill being introduced, the matter will necessarily receive consideration.
*(7.35.)  MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : I beg to second the Amendment. My hon. Friend has referred in his speech more particularly to Ireland and Scotland; he has not made many references to Wales, and, indeed he was not very happy in those he has made—thereby it seems to me adding an argument to the many he has used in favour of the principle of the Amendment. The Principality is the smallest of the nationalities mentioned in the Resolution, but I do not think it is the least interesting, and I do not think it is less capable of self-government than England, Scotland, or Ireland. Whatever will tend to increase the efficiency and vigour of Parliament ought to commend itself to every Member of this House. There seems to be a consensus of opinion that the Parliamentary machine is clogged with the arrears of legislation we have to deal with. There are many small questions coming before this House which ought not to come before it all. It is not a dignified thing for an Imperial Parliament to have to trouble itself with small questions similar to those mentioned by my hon. Friend. The second part of the Amendment deals with the principle of devolution. I do not see any danger at all in that principle, and I venture to join my hon. Friend in the appeal he has made that the discussion should not be carried on in a Party spirit, but with the object of seeing what can be done to increase the efficiency of this House by devolving upon the different nationalities the management of their own affairs. There has been a great access of national feeling in Wales during the last few years. I think everyone will admit that the comparatively greater attention paid to Welsh matters in this House is due
 450 "So that we crave pardon, Sir, if we say it was fit for the honour of your dominions, that some part of it should never be conquered.… To your Highness, therefore, we offer all obedience, desiring only that we may be defended against the insults of our malignant censurers. For we are not the offspring of the runaway Britains (as they term us), but natives of a country, which, besides defending itself, received all those who came to us for succour.… As for our language, though it stems harsh, it is that yet which was spoken anciently, not only in this island, but in France. Some dialects whereof remain still amongst the Bas-Bretons there, and here in Cornwall. Nor shall it be a disparagement (we hope) that it is spoken so much in the throat, since the Florentine and Spaniard affect this kind of pronounciation, as believing words that sound so deep proceed from the heart.… We doubt not, but as in all countries the mountains have afforded as eminent wits and spirits as any other part, so ours, also, by your Highness's good favour and employment may receive that esteem." "If ever there was a people who were a separate nationality, it is the Welsh. They

"In Welsh, Irish, and Scotch questions—in matters where they are entitled to decide for themselves—the other partners are borne down, overruled, and cast out of the precincts of this House by the enormous preponderance of the English vote." 452 453 "And also that from henceforth no person or persons that use the Welsh speech or language shall have or enjoy any manner office or fees within this Realm of England, Wales, or other the King's dominion, upon pain of forfeiting the same offices or fees, unless he or they use and exercise the English speech or language." 454 455 456
 EARL COMPTON  (York, W.R., Barnsley) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether any temporary clerks have recently been appointed to the Savings Bank Department who have not passed any Civil Service examination, and who do not hold certificates from
 478
 EARL COMPTON : I beg to ask the Postmaster General, in view of the fact that telegraphists of the Central Telegraph Office, performing duty on Sundays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., have no stated time allowed for their mid-day meal, whether he will direct that they shall have an uninterrupted dinner time of half-an-hour, similar to that which is given to the staff on week-days?
 MR. W. PRITCHARD-MORGAN  (Merthyr Tydvil) : I beg to ask the Attorney General, as regards the colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia, has the Crown parted with or transferred to the Legislatures of those colonies, not only the management and control of the waste lands of the Crown, but the gold and silver contained therein in such a way that the Crown cannot ever again make any claim to the gold and silver or to royalties thereupon; whether the Government is aware that the respective Governments of the colonies referred to insert in leases to work for gold a reservation that the grant is made "except as against Her Majesty," or "subject to Her Majesty's rights;" whether the effect of such reservations would enable the Crown, during the existence of such leases, to terminate such leases or resume possession of such mines; whether, on the termination of any such leases in the colonies referred to, Her Majesty could refuse to renew such leases, and take possession of such mines without compensation; whether the Crown is in receipt of any royalties from the gold and silver mines in the colonies referred to; and does the gold and silver in all Her Majesty's possessions, except the colonies referred to, still belong to the Crown; and, if so, does the Crown charge or receive any royalties from gold or silver mines in such possessions outside Great Britain?
 SIR R. WEBSTER : The hon. Member appears to confound the rights of the
 485
 MR. J. E. ELLIS : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the Rules made by the Land Commission and now in force can be laid upon the Table in a classified and collected form?
 SIR F. MILKER  (Nottingham, Bassetlaw) : I wish to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, considering there is no chance of a discussion being taken on the Eight Hours Bill on Wednesday, it will be possible to grant a day either before or after Easter in order to discuss the question?
 MR. STAVELEY HILL  (Staffordshire, Kingswinford) : When may we expect the Papers in regard to Newfoundland to be laid on the Table?
 MR. STAVELEY HILL : May we expect them on this side of Easter? They are very important Papers, and we were told that we should have them soon.
 MR. SHAWLEFEVRE : That is, I presume, for the ships. In respect to shipbuilding by contract we find that no less than £6600,000 is unexpended during the present year. By these amounts, therefore, vessels will be slower in building than was anticipated: in other words, the system adopted under the Naval Defence Act is having no better effect than the old system, in hastening ships. On the contrary, I believe the construction of ships is being delayed even to a greater extent than under the old system.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member ought to defer raising such a question until the Colonial Office Vote is reached. The only item in the present Vote is for telegrams.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Gentleman is quite entitled to ask as to any telegraphic charge, but not to discuss general questions of Colonial Policy.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : It is not in Order.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That is quite outside the question of this Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : But that question is quite outside the scope of the Vote.
 MR. CONTBEARK : When was the Treaty ratified? This is the first I have heard of it.
(11.51.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I am sadly in want of a little enlightenment, and candidly confess I do not know what the "Treasury Chest" means. If it has occurred in the Estimates before it has escaped my notice. Is there a "Treasury Chest" for India? So far as I can make out, this Vote has the laudable object of making up the difference between gold and silver in payment of salaries in Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. Now, we know there have been constant complaints that officers in India suffer heavy loss by the depreciation of the value of the rupees in which they are paid. If there is a Treasury Chest in Downing Street which puts this matter right for Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, why is there not a Treasury Chest for India, where the loss is felt in a more marked manner? This Vote arises, I presume, out of questions connected with the bi-metallic currency, and there may be a reason which has special reference to Hong Kong and the Straits. Settlements, but the sum is large, and I think we may well ask for some explanation.
 COLONEL NOLAN : But what is the Treasury Chest?
(11.56.)  COLONEL NOLAN : But I want the Point to be made clear—is it due to depreciation in silver or to rate of exchange? I think we ought to have the distinction drawn. I know these matters are much mixed up by Indian officials. For my own part I do not pretend to know much about it, and so I seek information.
 COLONEL NOLAN : But it is not the same thing.
 THE CHAIRMAN : These observations have no reference to the clause.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That has no reference to this clause.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That clearly has no relevance to the clause.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That is not relevant to this clause.
(12.20.)  MR. SHAW LEPEVRE : Is it not a fact that for two years attempts have been made to raise a Militia at St. Helena, but that, practically, there are no able-bodied men in the Island, all the people having gone to the African gold fields?
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : I gave that answer. The hon. Gentleman was not present.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : The Convention was presented to the House in November, 1890. I explained its provisions three or four times last Session.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : Oh, no. The Convention was discussed last year on the Colonial Vote, on two separate occasions.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : The Government of Swaziland is at this moment vested in three persons as I have already stated. It is for this Joint Government to lay down such laws for the regulation of the liquor traffic as they think fit. Moreover, it is expressly provided in the Convention that the Representatives forming the Joint Government shall have no share in the management of affairs in which natives alone are concerned. I can, however, assure the hon. Member that, so far as Her Majesty's Government are concerned, they will be most willing to do anything in their power to modify the evils of the liquor traffic. Where-ever Her Majesty's Government have control they have made very stringent prohibitive laws, and have done their best to carry them out. But in this case they have no power to interfere, and can only hope that the three Representatives forming the Government will do their utmost to check the evils feared.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : Will the hon. Gentleman read Article 6 of the Convention? If the hon. Gentleman had read the Convention his speech would not have been delivered.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : I think I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that the picture is very highly coloured and very much overdrawn.
*(8.17.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : I will deal first with the observations of the hon. Member for Edinburgh. The hon. Gentleman will remember that by the 9th clause of the Convention entered into with the Transvaal Republic, it was agreed that any deficit in the revenue available for the purposes of the joint Government should be borne in equal shares. The annual deficit has been approximately estimated at £14,000,
 541
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : I do not understand that, but I may say that a great many of the concessions have been investigated, and the bad ones are being sifted out. As to the important question raised by the hon. Member for Camborne, who has asked whether Her Majesty's Government are prepared to suppress the liquor traffic in Swaziland, there is every wish on the part of the Government to deal with the liquor traffic, but it is utterly impossible to go beyond the Convention. That has already been ratified.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : It is utterly impossible for us to go beyond the Convention, and to introduce new conditions after the Treaty has been ratified.
*(9.24.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : I can assure the hon. Gentleman the increase is not in connection with the South Africa Company; the bulk of the telegrams chargeable under the Vote have relation to Bechuanaland and Swaziland. There was an extensive telegraphic correspondence during the negotiation of the Convention.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : The question referred to by the hon. Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Buchanan) has not been overlooked. I may say I did not complain at all of the question being brought on. What I complained of was the statement of the hon. Member for Camborne (Mr. Conybeare) that the question had never been brought before the House. When the matter was discussed in August last I gave a complete telegraphic summary of the Convention. The hon. Member for Camborne has asked me about the liquor traffic in the colonies. Hon. Members must recollect that, as we have not annexed Swaziland, we have no power to put down the liquor traffic. We have to consult the Representative of the Transvaal Government and also the Representative of the Swazis themselves. The hon. Member for Camborne says the Swazis are not represented; but they have a Representative in Mr. Shepstone, whose sole business it is to look after their interests. I can give the hon. Member an assurance that we will instruct our Representative to press on his colleagues the desirability of checking the liquor traffic as far as possible. That is all we have power to do, because we cannot act without the co-operation of the Representatives of the Transvaal and the Swazis.
*(10.25.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : I am sure that those who have listened to the speech of my hon. and gallant Friend must feel that he expressed not only the views of the great majority of this House, but the great majority of the people of this country when he said that, if Her Majesty's Government had adopted the course suggested by the hon. Member for Caithness of handing over to the Transvaal the white and native population, we would have acted contrary to their wishes. My hon. Friend, in referring to the concessions, seemed to believe that they had been sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government. No statement could be more erroneous. Those concessions, as I stated in the earlier part of the evening, have been investigated, and we have discarded those which are worthless, and have been obtained by improper means. Therefore, there is not a shadow of foundation for saying that Her Majesty's Government in the slightest degree approved the concessions referred to by the hon. Member for Caithness. The speech of the hon. Member for Caithness was rather a remarkable one, because he spoke in the interests of the Boers in urging that the Treaty of London ought never to have been made. While implying that Her Majesty's Government had some responsibility for the making of it, he seemed to forget that it was made in 1884, when the right hon. Member for Mid Lothiau was in power, and that his policy with regard to the Transvaal was the subject of a Vote of Censure moved against the Government of the day. The hon. Member said that, notwithstanding the existence of that Treaty, it should be abrogated or ignored by the Government, and Swaziland handed over to the Boers. There were three courses open to the Government. One was to ignore the arrangement of 1884 and take over Swaziland; secondly, to abrogate the Treaty of 1884 and allow the Boers to take it over; and the third and most rational course was the one which has been
 558 559
 *BARON DE WORMS : That provides that concessions within the boundaries of Swaziland shall be recognised and respected if they meet with the approval of Her Majesty's Commissioner. That is the very article to which I should have thought the hon. Member would not have drawn attention. His argument has been all the way through that these reckless concessions have been recognised by the Government, and yet here, in this very Convention signed by the Government, is a clause that any reckless or absurd concession shall not be declared valid unless it meets with the approval of Her Majesty's High Commissioner or of the President of the Transvaal Republic. Anything more illogical than the hon. Member's argument could hardly be conceived. Article 5 saves the Swazis from being dragged into illegal or improper concessions. The Government did not agree to the Treaty until it was expressly arranged that the Swazis themselves should have a special Representative. Mr. Shepstone is that special Representative, and he has equal authority with the Representatives of Great Britain and of the Transvaal Republic. Therefore, the policy of the Government has been to protect the Swazi nation. There is no doubt the degraded condition of Swaziland was brought about by the chronic drunken condition of its late King I must say the suggestion of the hon.
 560
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : The question of right is now being tried.
*(7.32.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : Sir' I am sure the hon. Gentleman will not wish me to consider the expediency of giving up to France territory which we are now engaged in delimiting. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the Agreement of the 10th August, 1889, he will see by Article V. we have the right of nominating Commissioners to make such special survey as might be necessary to establish the line of demarcation between the English and the French territory. This sum of £600 is simply for the purpose of paying the Commissioners who were engaged in the delimitation of the boundaries. The delimitation of a portion of the boundaries, from Lagos to Porto Novo, has been successfully performed by an English and a French officer. At present the Commissioners are engaged in the delimitation of Gambia and Sierra Leone, the geography of which is very difficult. The delimitation is being carefully carried out in order to prevent the possibility of future dispute. It was decided to appoint officers who were capable of making a survey, and Royal Engineer officers, with a staff of non-commissioned officers and men, were appointed. It is to pay a proportion of the expenses of these officers and men that the £600 is now asked for. We divide the expense with the colony, which provides, in addition, a local trans-
 534
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : This person, named Buxton, went out to the Gambia to find a Government appointment. He found none, and went on to Sierra Leone. He could not pay his hotel bill, and was turned into the streets. Then the residents got up a subscription for him, and sent him back to England after he had been in the colony for a day or two. Soon after his return he brought out a flaming prospectus for carrying a railway across the Sahara. If the hon. Gentleman possessed the information which I have about Mr. Buxton I do not think he would attach any importance whatever to his letters in the  Daily Graphic
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : It is quite impossible to say.
*(6.30.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : The hon. and gallant Gentleman must be aware that it is absolutely impossible for me to give such information at a moment's notice, but if he will put down a Question I will give all information I can obtain.
*(6.34.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : I am sure the hon. Gentleman does not wish to misrepresent me; I have not refused the information. I have explained that I am not prepared with it at the moment. I said that of this extra expenditure a great deal was due to receiving answers to questions asked in this House. The hon. Gentleman knows that it continually happens that upon the Notice Question being answered an hon. Member supplements it by asking that the information desired may be telegraphed for, and it would be considered extremely discourteous if I refused to obtain information in that manner. I can call to mind an instance when the Western Australia Constitution Bill was before the House in which a telegram was sent to West Australia, and the rate for such telegrams is 8s. a word. Several times during those Western Australia Government Debates the Government were asked to telegraph for information.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The Chartered Company pay for their own telegrams.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : The Vote to some extent arises from the increase of questions in this House, necessitating inquiries to be made by telegram in all parts of the globe.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : All I can say is that they are being pressed forward as rapidly as possible.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : I cannot fix a date; but they are in the course of preparation.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The answer to the first part of the hon. Member's question is no, and to the second yes. It is impossible to reply to the third question until the Bill has been received. As regards the last two questions Her Majesty's Government cannot at the present moment undertake to say that before they finally decide to grant responsible government to Natal, an opportunity for discussing the question in the House of Commons shall be given, because the intervention of Parliament is not necessary in this case; but when the Correspondence (which may yet be prolonged) is in a sufficiently complete state it will, with the Bill, be presented to Parliament.
 CAPTAIN M'CALMONT  (Antrim, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he can now make a statement relative to the establishment of a mail service to and from the North of Ireland, by Larne and Stranraer?
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the distress alleged to exist in Achill; that many of the inhabitants are on the brink of starvation; whether he is aware that only a small proportion of the islanders have had relief work given them, these being obliged in numerous instances to travel very long distances to and from work; that the supply of seed potatoes has run short; that many of them have been found to be rotten, and that in many cases the good ones have been consumed for food; and whether any steps will be taken to remedy the alleged faults in relief of distress in Achill?
 DR. TANNER : Is it the fact that persons in this district have to travel 8 or 10 miles in order to get the relief at present supplied?
 DR. TANNER : If I supply the right hon. Gentleman with instances, will he institute an inquiry?
(4.23.)  DR. TANNER : Any one present last Friday must have been perfectly aware that outside in the Lobby, at the time of the count, there was at least a score of Members, including some junior Members of the Government, who did their best to obstruct other hon. Members, including myself, from entering the House. Everybody knows that the right hon. Gentleman does his best in his own highly respectable way, but I think he ought to make himself better informed in regard to what takes place in the House.
(7.21.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : We always appreciate the extremely nice way in which the right hon. Gentleman answers questions, but I never was so surprised as I was just now to learn from him that, practically speaking, we have defective bookkeeping in respect of the fees received in connection with examinations. We asked the right hon. Gentleman what was the reason for the increased expense under the Vote, and he says it is in consequence of increased examinations; and he supplements it by saying that the increased examinations bring in an increase of fees, so that there is a balance in favour of the Department. Then he tells us that the Vote is asked for in consequence of the extraordinary system of book-keeping of the Department. That seems to me rather ridiculous. The right hon. Gentleman belongs to one of the most important Departments of the State—the Department having charge of the public money—and I really think he should try and bring about some modification of this system which he tells us himself he takes exception to. The Committee ought to impress upon Her Majesty's Government the necessity of doing this. If the right hon. Gentleman can demonstrate to us a little more plainly why this money is asked for we shall be glad. If it is not really wanted why ask for it?
(11.32.)  DR. TANNER : In respect to these concessions we have heard a great deal of a Court of Inquiry into the abstract rights and wrongs; but has there been any specific point upon which
 569
(11.50.)  DR. TANNER : A few words of explanation on this would not be out of place from a high Financial Authority like the Chancellor of the Exchequer. How is it that he, with his great knowledge and experience, cannot in connection with these bi-metallic questions, make such provision as will save the Treasury from this large loss? This money only deals with the silver dollars of Hong Kong, the Straits Settlements, and, I think, Ceylon—only a small portion of a large colonial area. I hope we may not be told by such a great master of finance as the right hon. Gentleman is accounted by many to be, that it is due to chance that this loss occurs. Any want of foreknowledge on his part could be amply supplied by a right hon. colleague, the present Minister for Agriculture, who, we all know, has mastered the intricacies of the bimetallic system. I should like to know
 570
(12.5.)  DR. TANNER : In the Island of Achill a certain number of seed potatoes have been supplied and the Guardians will not be able to obtain security inasmuch as, owing to the abject poverty of the unfortunate people, they have been obliged to eat the seed potatoes supplied to them. I hope some special provisions will be made with regard to the administration of the measure in this particular district.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I wish to know what is being done about the seed potatoes in the Island of Achill?
 DR. TANNER : I would point out that the Bill is intended to supply seed potatoes to labourers, and as the season is advancing the sooner the potatoes are got in the better.
(11.28.)  DR. CLARK : I am glad to hear from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this is only a temporary arrangement. So far as its most important clauses are concerned, however, the treaty goes on for ever. Only one or two points affecting Tongaland will come to an end if that district does not join the Cape Customs Union. I do not think it will be possible for it to join the Customs Union, as Tongaland has on one side the Cape, with 15 per cent. Customs duties, and on the other side Natal with 5 per cent. duties. The hon. Member for Liverpool (Sir G. Baden-Powell) says the arrangement must be maintained because we have entered into it with the South African Republic. The South African Republic has, however, pointed out the absurdity of the arrangement, and it has only ratified it in order to give it a trial. Evidently the Government intended to give powers to this new and costly Court to annul certain concessions that had been legally granted, but were contrary to the rights of the Swazi people, and contrary to public policy; but, unfortunately, the 5th clause of the Convention construes all the concessions granted up till last year, and the 3rd clause only gives the Court power to consider disputed concessions. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer really represents the views of the Government they have adopted these clauses because they are afraid of public opinion. The thing will, however, break down financially, because I am satisfied, from my own knowledge of the Boers, that they will never pay for the support of an expensive Government which does no good to them or anybody else. I know the gentlemen who form this Court. The head of it (Mr. Detoy) is an English barrister, and I am sure that if supported by the Government they would, under the saving clause, consider these concessions on their merits, and in the interests of the Swfzi people. I am glad to have this assurance from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the arrangement is only a temporary one, and I am convinced that events will prove it is as indefensible as were the arrangements of 1881–84.
(7.24.)  DR. CLARK : The Government will make £136 this year by the London University. Under the head "a" we are told that it is caused by an increased number of theoretical examinations and by insufficient accommodation for University building, and there is an addition under the head "b" for examinations in physics. Under the circumstances—as the University of
 532
 DR. CLARK : There is an item of extra cost in respect of new buildings.
(6.45.)  DR. CLARK : May I ask, is anything being done in reference to the Report of the Select Committee on this question, which made certain recommendations? There have been complaints
 525
 DR. CLARK : All that requires the sanction of the Government is that which was granted after the date of the organic proclamation. The Court has to inquire into the validity of concessions which are disputed and which do not appear in the King's book But all the concessions, practically, were given to Shepstone, Nuller, and Thorburn; and as they took care they appeared in the King's book, the validity cannot be inquired into. The only ground upon which a concession can be declared void is, that it was obtained by fraud. And what has the Court done? I have carefully studied the South African papers, and all disputed concessions, with but one exception, have been declared valid and binding upon the Swazi people. I am not here in this House pleading the cause of the Boers; I am pleading the cause of the
 561
 DR. CLARK : May I point out that General Joubert has already urged the joint Government to do as the natives desire in regard to the liquor traffic.
(10.37.)  DR. CLARK : If the right hon. Gentleman had read Article 5 he would possibly have understood it, which he does not now. It begins by—saving all existing rights; and that is what I object to. Up to the proclamation of last year everything-given by Umbandine is reserved and saved by this clause.
 DR. CLARK : How about Article 5?
(9.40.)  DR. CLARK : I beg now to move a reduction of the Vote by £500, being the money contributed by this country of the deficiton the account of the territory, I move this because I am thoroughly opposed to the policy adopted by Her Majesty's Government, and because this is the first time we have had an opportunity of discussing that policy with the Papers before us. I should like to ask the Government one or two questions: Last time we were discussing this matter we had a telegraphic summary of the contents of the Convention before us, but since that we have had the Convention
 550 551 552 553 bonâ fide 554 555
 DR. CLARK : I notice that a portion of this Vote is for buildings. May I ask if the Government are considering the advisability of having a University for all London?
 DR. CLARK : But may I ask what is the source of this: there is another Vote for £1,750?
(6.33.)  DR. CLARK : It will be observed there is another Vote for £1,750 for telegrams for the High Commissioner alone. I should like to know if any portion of this was used for South Africa?
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : Can the right hon. Gentleman say how many telegrams were sent to South Africa?
(4.25.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I do not blame the Government. It seems that it is their policy to discredit private Members, in order that they may take
 494
(4.0.)  THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : I think the Committee will expect me to make some explanation of this Vote. When I introduced the Naval Defence Act I pointed out the extreme inconvenience of paying large balances into the Exchequer at the close of the financial year, whilst liabilities were carried forward to the following year. That system caused considerable disturbances in the continuity of finance. Therefore, an arrangement was made under the Naval Defence Act, by which all unexpended balances appropriated for specific purposes should be carried forward from year to year, and paid to the credit of the Naval Defence Act. In the interval between the making of my speech and the introduction of the Bill, the measure was in parts revised, and one or two alterations, which seemed to be only of a verbal character, were introduced into it. This year we had to put ourselves into communication with the Treasury for the purpose of asking them to allow us to make use of the unexpended balance of last year for the purpose of meeting the liabilities which fall upon the present financial year. Under Clause 3, Subsection A, of the Act, it was provided, that for the purpose of dock-yards, &c.—
 "The sum £2,650,000, or such less sum as may be required by the Admiralty, may be devoted in any one year," 495
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : No, Sir.
 LORD G. HAMILTON : The total number of Marines estimated for 1891–92 is 14,000. The total annual estimated cost of these numbers is £738,699, which includes £4,730, the total annual estimated cost of administration of the force. Taking the average of the current year and the two previous years, the cost of the relief of the British troops stationed abroad (excluding India) is estimated at £145,000 a year. These figures include the sea transport charges only.
 LORD G. HAMILTON : That is for armament.
 LORD G. HAMILTON : This is all for stores.
 LORD G. HAMILTON : The hon. Gentleman will find the information in my statement. In certain instances there was a falling off in speed of about a knot.
(6.7.)  LORD G. HAMILTON : I shall be very glad to give the right hon. Gentleman the information he asks for. Last year I announced that it was intended that the large ships should be made available for service within twelve hours. That has been done. I said it was intended to convert the Channel Squadron into a homogeneous squadron of modern battle-ships. That has been done. As regards the Coastguard ships, all of them are in a condition to be ready for action within 48 hours. The criticisms of the writer in the  Times 517 518
 MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether his attention has been called to the statement of Mr. Kynnersley, Her Majesty's Inspector, published in the last General Report of Mr. Blandford, Her Majesty's Inspector (Blue Book, 1889, p. 270), that—
 "It is now only in Birkenhead and Runcorn that we have really objectionable buildings," "The number of school places in the Public Elementary Schools of the Borough of Birkenhead, measured at eight feet per child, is 15,665;"
 MR. A. H. DYKE ACLAND  (York, W.R., Rotherham) : The original difficulty and doubt as to this subject was raised not by the County Councils, but came from another quarter. The doubt has become so wide-spread amongst many County Councils that I think it desirable to pass this measure. I hope the right hon Gentleman will allow these words to remain.
 MR. A. H. DYKE ACLAND  (York, W.R., Rotherham) : An hon. Member has objected to this Bill being proceeded with after 12 o'clock, but I would appeal to him to withdraw his objection so that the Bill can be read a second time and referred to the Select Committee, to which a Bill of a somewhat similar character has already been referred. By reading it a second time the House will not affirm its principle.
(5.44.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The right hon. Gentleman has just made one of his usual appeals to the principles of the Liberal Party; and in justification of that appeal has given us a short sketch of English History, beginning with Charles I and coming down to our own time. But there is one principle which he seems to have entirely forgotten. I always thought it an essential principle of the Liberal Party that a practice was not to be adhered to merely because it was old, but that it was possible to re-consider even the most ancient and traditional custom when it was thought it might be amended. I have believed also that that principle was not the absolute monopoly of either Political Party, although, if it were claimed more by one Party than by the other, it was by the party to which the right hon. Gentleman belongs. The right hon. Gentleman has told us that this Debate has been sprung upon us, and that now, at the very last moment, the Tory Government, led by a Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, intends to subvert the beneficial liberties of the country and to destroy one of the principles upon which the financial policy of the Government has hitherto been based. The right hon. Gentleman, who poses as a vigilant guardian of the public purse, seems to have forgotten the Debates that took place upon this subject some two or three years ago. It may aid the right hon. Gentleman to refer to those Debates, in which some very eminent colleagues of his took part, although possibly he may have taken no part in them himself. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Edinburgh (Mr. Childers) took part in them, and so, also, did the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian (Mr. Gladstone); and well do I recollect the constitutional views which they put forward, and which received a certain amount of support from the speech made by my noble Friend the Member
 511
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The right hon. Gentleman is mistaken. The model of the wooden ship changed less in a century than the model of an ironclad changes now in five years. Therefore, the object of this change of policy is to meet what never existed before. The right hon. Gentleman (Sir W. Harcourt) apparently supposes that we have in mere lightness of heart adopted this new method. He must know, if he has followed the policy of naval construction during the last 10 years, that it was forced upon the Government by the evils which were brought to their notice, and the right hon. Gentleman did not show throughout the whole course of his speech that he had the slightest appreciation of what those necessities are. The Government adopted this plan, to which the House gave their deliberate sanction, with the view of carrying out a complete and economical programme of shipbuilding; and before we can abandon that plan, we must have much stronger arguments than the flimsy and shadowy constitutional pretences brought forward by the right hon. Gentleman. Of course, if the Government were to withdraw from the consideration of the Committee money to be expended on a policy to be

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am unable to add anything to the reply which I gave on the same subject on Thursday last to the hon. Member for Darlington.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Irish Land Commissioners represent that the course suggested in this question would involve considerable trouble and inconvenience in the present pressure of their business, and that at an early date, upon Bills which are now before the House becoming law, it will be necessary to revise some of the existing rules, and to make new rules leading to a new codification. Perhaps, therefore, the hon. Member will defer his request for a little time. I will, however, confer with them further on the subject.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : In answer to my hon. Friend, I have to say that the legislation he proposes would probably not be easier to pass through the House than that for which it is a substitute. I propose, however, to re-introduce the Bann Drainage Bill next year, in the hope that it may pass without serious opposition.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Commissioners of National Education report that the practice referred to at Ballymoney Model School was unauthorised, and contrary to the universal practice in regard to National Schools in Ireland, which is to have an unbroken school-day, including, where it is desired, an interval of half an hour for recreation and luncheon, under supervision of the teacher. The Commissioners, to prevent any inconvenience to the parents by a sudden change, did consent to a continuance of the irregular proceeding to the end of last year. The second Memorial referred to did not, as a matter of fact, reach the Commissioners Office; but a communication from the Town Clerk of Ballymoney was received. The Reports of the Commissioners' Inspectors are treated as confidential. The Commissioners consider the rule of having an unbroken school-day to be one necessary for the efficiency of their school system, and they are unable to sanction its non-observance.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Constabulary authorities report that the fact is substantially as stated in the first paragraph of the question. The constable did not follow Mr. O'Brien to Bantry with a loaded rifle. There is no order extant in the Force of the nature indicated in the last paragraph.
 MR. BROOKFIELD  (Sussex, Rye)  I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether, with reference to the seventh paragraph of his Memorandum relating to the Army Estimates 1891–2, he can state the general military policy upon which increases in the Establishment of Volunteer Infantry have hitherto been sanctioned or refused; whether, in view of the recent reduction in the numbers of enrolled Volunteers, any modification has been permitted in the observance of a due proportion of strength between the two principal arms of the Volunteer Forces; and whether he can conveniently state the ground, military or otherwise, on which any such modifications have recently been allowed?

 MR. CONYBEARE : May I ask the right hon. Baronet if the Government will kindly consider whether the course taken in reference to Henry Silk Buckingham may not be adopted in this case?

 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Cam borne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether he can now specify the particular Statute Law or Regulation under which the Indian Government arrested Sheikh Abdul Rasoul and imprisoned him for nine months without trial and without bringing any charge against him; (2) whether the Regulation under which the Government acted in this matter is the same as that under which Henry Silk Buckingham was deported from India in or about the year 1818; (3) whether such Regulation has ever been embodied in the Indian Penal Code; (4) whether he can state the circumstances under which this Regulation was continued after the transfer of the powers of the old East India Company to the Imperial Government; (5) whether he will give a Return of the names of all the persons, native or otherwise, who have been arrested without charge or trial and deported under this or any other Statute or Regulation during the last 50 years, together with the particular circumstances of each case; and (6) whether there exists in India any Habeas Corpus Act or other statutory provision whereby any person so arrested without warrant may claim to be brought to trial without delay?

(7.50.)  MR. CONYBEARE : It may save time if I endeavour to bring this matter practically before the Committee by urging upon the Government a point in relation to the liquor traffic in Swaziland and the regulations authorised by the Government of this country in regard to it. I wish to draw the attention of the Government to the Appendix of the main Report of Sir F. de Winton, already quoted by the hon. Member for West Edinburgh, in which was given a very interesting account of the discussion on the liquor question which took place
 537 locus standi 538 539 540
 MR. CONYBEARE : I did not know that the Treaty had been ratified; but I wanted the Government, in any case, to carry out this policy of total prohibition.
 MR. CONYBEARE : Let us assume that provisions have been made. That disposes of the right hon. Gentleman's argument that our Representative has no power to deal with matters affecting the Swazi people themselves. All I say is that, on the broad, general principle, it was the duty of the Government to take measures for meeting the wishes of the Swazi people. The whole question arises on this Report of Sir F. de Winton, and we could not know what the wishes of the people were until we

(8.29.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I should like to point out that this Conference took place prior to the ratification of the Treaty, and the object was to ascertain first the views of the settlers, and secondly those of the natives, upon this grave question of the importation of intoxicating liquors. The natives had made a strong appeal to have the importation of liquor put an end to, in their own defence. I have shown the
 543
 MR. CONYBEARE : I only ask the Government to carry out the wishes expressed in the appeal of the Swazis themselves, that the importation of spirits should be totally prohibited.
 MR. CONYBEARE : This is the first opportunity we have had of discussing it.
(7.18.)  MR. CONYBEARE : Owing to a policy adopted not only by the present Government but by their predecessors, and in fact by all Governments, the books in these cases are of no value. The money is not required; still, it has to be spent. I have seen most curious entries about some Departments, and it comes to this: that when the money is voted they are bound to find somebody to receive it. The money is run away with in a most mysterious manner, and I would ask the right hon. Gentleman for an assurance that the fact that money is voted does not necessarily imply that it must all be spent.
(7.15.)  MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I should like to have some explanation of the increase in this Vote.
 MR. CONYBEARE : The country always expects a Government to do their duty, but they do not always do it. I do not suggest that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues did not think they were doing their duty, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer's argument was that if they had adopted the policy which is advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness (Dr. Clark), and which I do not support, namely, to hand Swaziland over to the Boers, they could not have stood against the indignant explosion of public opinion which he imagines would have ensued upon such an act of weakness, to use his own phrase. I am glad the right hon. Gentleman is, even at this late hour, learning something. Perhaps, the storm which was raised about his head last year in respect to his notorious Budget has led him to be wiser in future. But I want to point out that the closing words of the right hon. Gentleman's-speech were practically opposed to what we heard earlier in the evening from the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said if General Joubert, as my hon. Friend pointed out, is in favour of putting down the liquor traffic he will support the efforts in that direction made, or to be made, by our Representative, and the liquor traffic ought to have a short existence. That is not what the Under Secretary led us to understand. I put the question to the right hon. Gentleman: "Will you take steps for the prohibition of the liquor traffic?" and what was his answer?
 MR. CONYBEARE : I am speaking of the answer the right hon. Gentleman gave when I was here. Of course, during the evening I had to seek refreshment, like the right hon. Gentleman. The Under Secretary led me to understand that at the present time it was beyond the power of our Commissioner to interfere in this matter. He quoted Clause 6 of the Convention, and charged

 *MR. STUART WORTLEY : I understood the hon. Gentleman to take exception to the Charge for Sheerness and other places. Of course, at Chatham, Woolwich, and Sheerness there are large increases of the population owing to the Government dockyards and military stations, and this involves a greater demand for summary jurisdiction. As to whether the London Police Courts generally ought to be supported from local resources or the Imperial Treasury, that is a subject for abstract discussion. The maintenance of good order in the Metropolis is a matter of Imperial as well as of local concern, and in passing the main Estimates for the current financial year Parliament has sanctioned the principle at present obtaining.
*(6.54.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam : Of course, this is a Supplementary Vote, and the House has already sanctioned the principle with the ordinary Estimates for the year. I understand the hon. Gentleman to draw a distinction between the Courts in London and those at Sheerness, Chatham, and Woolwich, and proposes to divide against the Charge in relation to the latter places.
 MR. DAVID THOMAS  (Merthyr Tydvil) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade if he can state the amount of loan and debenture capital invested with Railway Companies in the United Kingdom upon which no interest has been paid for the year 1889, and upon which the rate of interest actually paid fell short of that at which the principal was borrowed; how much, if any, of the total interest paid on the loan and debenture capital was provided for other than out of  bonâ fide
 MR. DAVID THOMAS : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education if he is aware that much dissatisfaction has been caused by the refusal of the authorities of certain Training Colleges to allow candidates for admission to be examined at centres, such as Merthyr Tydvil, Cardiff, and Swansea, which have been fixed for the examinations for Queen's Scholarships; and whether, having regard to the fact that these Training Colleges are supported mainly by Government Grants, he will impress upon the Committees of such Colleges the desirability of allowing candidates to sit for examination at any centre fixed by the Department?
 *THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University : The object of this Bill is a limited one, and I do not think the clause now before the Committee will justify any general discussion respecting the administration of the Seed Potatoes Act. That Act, passed in the short Session of last year, inherited from the former Act of 1881 a provision under which it was necessary before a supply of potatoes was made to any one cultivating land in conacre, to get the consent of the tenant of the land, who must be a party to the advance. I quite agree that it will be the duty of the Board of Guardians to see that proper security is obtained, and that it will be the duty of the Local Government Board to watch the action of the Boards of Guardians in this respect. The object of the Bill is to enable the Boards of Guardians to deal in proper cases directly with the labourers. I hope the Committee will allow the Bill to be passed, particularly as at this season of the year it is desirable that steps should be at once taken.
 *MR. MADDEN : This clause does not open the general question of the Seed Potatoes Act, and I, therefore, should be out of order in discussing the point raised by the hon. Member.
(12.21.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : That is the position of those who do not want to see the Militia regiment raised. We do wish to see it raised, and think it possible to do it.
(12.19.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : There has been no change of policy. We are endeavouring to raise a local Militia at St. Helena. We have not done it yet, but as soon as we have done it we propose to reduce the garrison of Imperial forces.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : No officer has been recommended for the Victoria Cross in connection with the recent engagement at Tokar.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : Increases in the Establishment of Volunteer Infantry have been granted or refused with reference to local requirements under the scheme of mobilisation, to the interests of adjoining corps, and to the probabilities of recruiting. Local defence considerations have been specially considered in every case in which increases have been sanctioned. Any recent modifications of Establishment have been settled on the basis indicated above.
*(5.58.)  MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E) : As Her Majesty's Government have fallen back on the plea of administration as an excuse, I wish to draw attention to this one fact, that in a very important speech delivered in 1888 the First Lord of the Admiralty, I think, in introducing the Naval Defence Bill, said the building of the  Trafalgar
*(10.5.)  CAPTAIN BETHELL  (York, E.R., Holderness) : I quite concur with the statement that our having allowed the Boers to penetrate in Swaziland has been the cause of much of the trouble; I do not personally think there was anything in the treaty to prevent our taking Swaziland and ruling it ourselves, even without the assent of the Transvaal Government, but this was not the general opinion. I am strongly opposed to the alternative suggested by the hon. Member opposite, namely, that we should hand Swaziland over to the Transvaal Government; to do this, without making satisfactory arrangement for the welfare of the people, would have been a sad breach of faith. It has occurred to me that supposing the present arrangement should last for a number of years, an opening might be offered for undoing what we did in 1886, by making some sort of an exchange for that portion of the territory which is between Swaziland and Natal; but that is a question of future policy. Not having taken either of these courses there only remained the policy Her Majesty's Government have adopted. The hon. Member opposite has taken exception to this policy on various grounds. He says the interests of the natives have been entirely set aside, and that the arrangement come to has been contracted against the advice and judgment of those who are most experienced in South African affairs. I am under the impression, from what I have read, that Sir Hercules Robinson was in favour of handing Swaziland over to the Transvaal Government, but that was because he was of opinion that our own Government could not act strongly enough if they were to take over the territory. I want to point out, that on a question of policy of this sort we are entitled to judge for ourselves, while giving the High Commissioner's opinion every weight, though not treating it as if it dealt with a matter entirely beyond us. We have to look

 *MR. GOSCHEN : If the Representative of the Boers is in favour of putting down the liquor traffic, and will support our Representative in his efforts in that direction, the liquor traffic ought to have a very short existence. My right hon. Friend has undertaken to use all his influence in that direction.
*(10.50.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I am glad the House understands now that when the hon. Member for Caithness talks of the debauching of the Swazis, the Government which made the arrangement of 1881 was the Government which began the debauching of the Swazis. In the early part of his speech it would have been thought that it was the policy of the present Government which has had that effect. The hon. Gentleman spoke as if it was the present Government which brought Mr. Shepstone there, but what has been the policy of
 562 563
 *MR. GOSCHEN : The argument was used on the last occasion, just as it is used now, but Parliament decided upon a certain programme. It settled that certain ships should be built and finished, and the money raised for them in a certain way. Was it desirable, after this solemn resolve, that we should be exposed to the contingency that a future Government—I did not speak of a future Parliament—should interfere with the continuity of shipbuilding for four or five years? Our whole argument, our whole policy, was this: that precautions should be taken by Act to secure continuity for our programme for five years. That is the great crime with which we stand charged. We pointed out that no guns had been supplied, or, if they were, that there was no ammunition for them, and that the ships were far longer building than was necessary. ["No, no!"] We have it on record, and it cannot be denied that frequently the Admiralty changed the plans for a portion of some vessel, and that delayed its construction, while money that was voted for building was devoted to repairs. We considered it wiser to have continuous building, and I do think the right hon. Gentleman has exaggerated the scope of our proposal. Of course, the new Parliament will be able to deal with this as with any other Acts. The whole crime, as I understand, is that we have put into an Act what we formerly brought before Committee of Supply.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : Then my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Lothian, when he passed the Mobilisation of Forces Act, 1871, destroyed control over that amount of expenditure, just as we are said to be destroying control now. How does the right hon. Gentleman get out of that difficulty? The sanction of expenditure by an Act of Parliament has been done continually. It is done in every instance where there is a loan. The right hon. Gentleman says we have destroyed the control of the House of Commons. That is to say, nothing is to be done by loan. I admit to the full

*(5.54.)  MR. GOSCHEN : It would appear that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Newcastle, as well as the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, does not remember the Debates which took place on the Naval Defence Bill. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian discussed this very objection to the Bill.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby has asserted that this was not discussed.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman has referred to future Parliaments. Why could not a future Parliament repeal the Act?
 *MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman ought to be more careful in his language. He spoke of Parliament.
*(5.29.)  MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman is indulging in some exaggeration. I do not shrink from the just inference which may be drawn from my words; but the right hon. Gentleman does not draw the correct inference, when he says that what we did was to substitute au Act of Parliament for the estimate. We placed the item on the Consolidated Fund in order that it should not be made the subject of an annual Vote, but the control of Parliament remains. Of course, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, an Act of Parliament can be repealed. Therefore, the naval policy of the country has not been withdrawn from the control of a future House of Commons, for the right hon. Gentleman and his friends, if they should think right, will be able to repeal the Naval Defence Act. My own views may well have undergone some modification since 1879, for I have had experience of the difficulties caused in naval matters by the system ordinarily pursued. I have endeavoured to explain to the House the difficulties into which the Navy and our system of naval construction have got owing to the policy which has been pursued during the last eight or nine years. I have seen all the disasters that have resulted from that system. Sometimes it has happened that there were guns for which no ammunition was provided, and in other cases it has happened that there were ships for which no guns were provided; while with regard to the ships themselves, they have been so slowly constructed that in some cases they have been rendered practically valueless for times of emergency. I have also seen the results which have been pointed out by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby (Sir W. Harcourt), with regard to our fortifications, where the necessary work has been spread over a long time, so that had any necessity arisen in the meantime neither ships nor fortifications would have been ready. In answer to the right hon. Gentleman, I say that if these defences are essential to the national safety, it cannot be wrong for us to depart from the ordinary practice, and

 *MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman has applied criticisms which

 *MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman means to say it would have been more straightforward and honest to borrow and to spread the payment over a long instead of a short term. I fail to see that. It would, of course, have been easy for the Government to take a loan, as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman, and extend the repayment over a long period of years. But Her Majesty's Government did not think that would be sound finance. We thought it ought to be spread over the shortest possible number of years and accordingly this expenditure was spread over seven years. The right hon. Gentleman has apparently forgotten the case of the Localisation of the Forces Bill in 1871, which is a precise precedent for the course taken on the present occasion. The right hon. Gentleman has referred to three Acts—the Imperial Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act, and the Barracks Act. I was a little surprised to hear all these Acts introduced into a Debate on a Supplemental Estimate,

 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : It took more.
(6.12.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I do not quite follow the noble Lord in saying that, but for the Naval Defence Act, it would not have been necessary to take this Supplementary Vote, but I wish to point out, in answer to the statement made by himself and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the system adopted under the Naval Defence Act is likely to have the effect of hastening the construction of ships, that experience is rather in the opposite direction. I find that in 1888–9, £300,000, which had been provided for by Parliament, was not expended in the year, and that in the current year £200,000 has been unexpended on shipbuilding in the dockyards.

(6.39.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : If this answer had been given earlier I do not think there would have been any difference of opinion. This is just the information we required; but when the Under Secretary put the increase upon such a novel ground that this House was responsible, he must not be surprised that objection was taken.
(6.36.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : The ordinary Estimates for the year included a large sum for telegrams, and this is a Supplementary Vote. Reasons for the increase must have been sent to the Treasury; can my right hon. Friend the Secretary to the Treasury tell us upon what information the Treasury sanctioned this additional Estimate?
(6.57.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : I venture to think this has ceased to be an abstract question, and now assumes a concrete shape. When this question was raised some 10 years ago the answer given by the then Secretary to the Treasury was that it was impossible that the question could be raised with any advantage until London was invested with municipal government, and a pledge was given, which has been repealed since, that when London had her own municipal government the expenses of the Courts should be defrayed as they are in all other great towns of the United Kingdom. Of course, I should be out of order in raising the general question, but I can promise the Government that it will be raised when the Estimates

(6.58.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : The Under Secretary says it is the duty of the Imperial Government to provide specially for the Police Courts at Sheerness and elsewhere, because there happens to be a large amount of Government dockyard labour. But is that the case with Plymouth or Pembroke or Portsmouth? No; there is no pretence that the Government labour entails heavier local expenditure on the Courts. We know perfectly well that people like to have these Government establishments. The populations of garrison and dockyard towns should, above all others, pay for the local administration of justice, because the existence of the Government establishments brings so much trade to the localities.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : No; I said I was opposed to the whole of the Vote, though perhaps it might be possible for the Treasury to pay a certain sum—say £500—annually to defray the costs arising at Bow Street, in respect to magisterial investigations in relation to international matters. I can understand the reasonableness of that.
(6.49.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : Once more I must raise the question whether the expenses of Police Courts in London and the suburbs should be borne on the Imperial taxation or should be borne by London itself. We have Police Courts in the towns we represent, and in these towns most assuredly the inhabitants pay for them. In London that is not the practice. This practice of placing these expenses on the Estimates has, I

 MR. LABOUCHERE : Have we a guarantee from the right hon. Gentleman that there is no sort of religious test upon any person whatsoever in seeking to pass an examination at the London University?
(9.23.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I understand that my hon. Friend (Dr. Clark) intends to move a reduction of the Vote on specific grounds; and as that may deprive me of the opportunity, I now wish to put a question in reference to the telegrams to the Lord High Commissioner. The original Estimate was £750, but now we have £1,750. An increase of a few hundreds I could understand, but the original Estimate is more than trebled. I suppose this is in connection with the Chartered Company of South Africa, but is there any explanation of this excessive amount?
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I think I might be allowed to ask this financial question: whether any of these telegrams refer to the Chartered Company of South Africa, because, if so, I imagine we might raise the question whether such telegrams ought to be
 520
(6.31.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : But the right hon. Gentleman has told us that the increase in this item of expenditure is mainly due to the questions asked by hon. Members in this House, so surely he must have in his mind some idea of the approximate cost of telegrams on this account. The expenditure on telegrams is increased by £500, and the right hon. Gentleman, putting it rather as a slur upon the conduct of hon. Members, says, this expense has been mainly caused by questions asked here. But we repudiate responsibility for any increase of the kind. We, in the exercise of our undoubted right, put questions to Ministers on public matters, and we naturally suppose that the public Department concerned can supply the information we desire, but we have never supposed that the Colonial Office is so absolutely ignorant on colonial matters that to answer a simple question they have to telegraph to the Antipodes.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : No doubt, they do; but I apprehend that if telegrams refer to matters concerning the Chartered Company, for instance to the enlistment of persons like Colonel Carrington for the Chartered Company, the Chartered Company ought to pay for them. This is important because we have speculative companies established in South Africa, and I notice that little by little we are being called upon to pay sums in respect of them. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will clearly explain whether any of the telegrams apply directly or indirectly to the action of Colonel Carrington, or to any other English official, with regard to the Chartered Company—in fact, whether if the Chartered Company had not been in existence these telegrams would have been sent at all.

 MR. LABOUCHERE : Are these men who have been "rightly struggling to be free" to be deported to Lower Egypt, and for what purpose has the amnesty decree been issued by the Khedive?

MATTHEWS : I have received a telegram from the Vicar, from which I gather that the facts are as stated, except that the clerk did not refuse to receive any payment at all unless all the fees were paid. The duty of tolling the bell is prescribed by a Canon, the terms of which make it doubtful whether it applies to any persons but parishioners who have been attended by a minister or curate of the Church. I beg to refer the hon. Member to an answer which I gave in this House on July 30, 1888. The answer to the last paragraph de-
 482
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am not aware that the Legislature has ever laid down
 486
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, Sir; I gather from statements made before the coroner that the man Sadler had been drinking excessively from house to house. The figures quoted in the second paragraph are correct. There was one case where proceedings were taken for permitting drunkenness, and this was dismissed by the Magistrate. The Commissioner of Police assures me that every effort is made for the efficient enforcement of the law, and the figures quoted show that the police are not inactive. But the hon. Member is doubtless aware that there are great difficulties of proof in cases where publicans are charged with permitting drunkenness, and I do not think those difficulties will he removed by alteration of the law.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The Commissioner of Police informs me that the coroner's depositions confirm the statement I made on February 26th—namely, that there was no assault on Sadler in the presence of the police, and that the only constable who saw him at the dock gate did not consider him to be in such a
 484
 MR. MATTHEWS : No, Sir; the coroner's depositions are only made public in the event of a verdict of murder or manslaughter on the occasion of the trial by the authorities.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, Sir; information to that effect has reached me, but I have made careful and independent inquiry, and I find that the houses in question have not been demolished at the instance of the Railway Company, but of a private freeholder, whose solicitors inform me that the site has been cleared for rebuilding under the requirements of a reversionary lease granted to their clients in 1882, and that most of the houses were in a thoroughly insanitary condition, and altogether unfit for human habitation. As I stated in reply to a question on the 24th of January last, I have no reason whatever to believe that the Railway Company intend to evade their legal obligations, and they are now preparing a scheme for my approval with the view to giving effect to the 33rd section of the Act quoted.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have not got the name with me, but I will tell my hon. Friend privately.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : Yes, Sir; I am aware that considerable opposition has been manifested by the retailers of petroleum oil against this Bill. I have no information about consumers. This opposition appears to have arisen without a sufficiently careful examination of the proposed measure, which is framed with a view of safeguarding small retailers, and which improves the position of hawkers. If the hon. Member will refer to the Bill of 1883, and to the Report of the House of Lords Committee upon it, he will see that large concessions have been made to the convenience of traders in the Bill of this year, which has been introduced after repeated conferences with the trade, and in consequence of the strong representations of Local Authorities and of the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Thames Conservators, the London County Council, and other Public Bodies that amended legislation is urgently needed in the interests of public safety. I shall, however, be glad to consider any proposals for amendments in detail where it is shown that the Bill is of too restrictive a character. The answer to the second paragraph is in the negative.
 MR. MATTHEWS : No doubt there will be a full discussion on the Second Reading.
 MR. MATTHEWS : It will not be possible to take it on this side of Easter; but it is a matter which will be arranged by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I hope that the Memorandum which I have promised my hon. Friend will be in the hands of Members in the course of a week or ten days, and I will defer the Second Reading of the Bill until a reasonable time has elapsed for its consideration.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : The Regulations of the Post Office respecting sick leave are, so far as I am aware, not inconsistent with the provisions of Clause 9 of the Order in Council. That clause provides that no Second Division clerk shall be absent ill for more than two days without furnishing a medical certificate. That is to say, two days is to be the maximum period allowed before a medical certificate is furnished. But this is not equivalent to saying that a medical certificate shall not be required before the third day. The Post Office practice is to require one on the second day and in the Order in Council, as I read it, there is nothing to require that the Post Office practice should be altered.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the noble Lord, I have to state that at the Central Station special arrangements are made with a view to enable the telegraphists as far as possible to obtain their meals on Sundays without interruption. As regards the time occupied in taking them, there is no objection to as much as half-an hour being allowed for the purpose.
 *MR. RAIKES said: My answer must be regarded as fixing the practice in future.
 *MR. RAIKES : It will I think be convenient to include in one answer the replies to the three questions of the noble Lord. In order to diminish the pressure of work in the Savings Bank, I obtained the sanction of the Treasury to place on special duty a temporary force of over 150 officers, who are now at work there. This force is composed of about 130 clerks belonging to other offices, and holding Civil Service certificates, of 8 certificated Second Division clerks lent by the Civil Service Commissioners, and of 15 non-certificated assistants, for whose employment I obtained special Treasury authority. I have no knowledge whether there are any other candidates who have passed the Civil Service Examination and are waiting for appointments. I have not

 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the fact that a police constable named Connell, stationed at Schull, County Cork, deliberately loaded his rifle in the presence of a large assemblage of people returning from a meeting which was addressed by Mr. William O'Brien, M.P.; whether he is also aware that Connell, with another police constable, followed Mr. William O'Brien from Schull to Bantry, carrying a loaded rifle in his hand; and whether police constables, when following Irish Members of Parliament, are ordered to carry loaded firearms?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : The Government have control over the administration of the Act——
(12.11.)  MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : The right hon. Gentleman has not given me a reply to my question.
(12.2.)  MR. J. P. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I do not wish to delay this Bill, but I desire to get some explanation. I want to know whether the right hon. Gentleman has obtained thorough information in regard to the districts to be supplied under the Seed Bill? I find that in Gweedore and in other distressed districts in Ireland at the present time, no seed potatoes have been provided. I find there is in Gweedore only one resident Guardian, who is a land-agent, and that the Chairman of the Poor Law Board is the well-known Mr. Olphert. I wish to know whether under this Bill the Government will be prepared to make the Board do their duty and, that failing that, they will themselves be able to undertake the duty which the Board so grossly neglects?
 MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : Are we to understand that the Second Reading will not be taken on this side of Easter?
 MR. STANSFELD  (Halifax) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether his attention has been drawn to any recent advertisements or prospectuses of companies in which it is stated that applicants for shares shall be deemed "absolutely to waive all rights to compensation under 'The Directors' Liability Act, 1890;'" and whether such an announcement is an evasion of the provisions of that Act?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if he will lay upon the Table copies of the Memorials he has received?
 *MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : I really think an answer is due to us with respect to this great increase in cost of telegrams. The right hon. Gentleman puts this extra charge as mainly due to getting answers to questions we, in the exercise of the privilege of Members, put in this House, and then, being further challenged, he says it is utterly impossible for him to say what amount is due to the cause he
 522
(6.37.)  MR. H. HEATON  (Canterbury) : I should like to ask the Under Secretary for the Colonies whether his statement, that this increase is chiefly due to questions asked in this House, is based upon information supplied by permanent officials at the Colonial Office, because my information in regard to these telegrams is of a totally different character?
(6.40.)  MR. H. HEATON : The right hon. Gentleman has not answered my question as to the source of the information that the excess on the Vote is due to questions asked in the House. Is it derived from the permanent officials in the office? because my information is directly contrary to that.
*(11.1.)  SIR J. POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : The right hon. Gentleman has said very truly that Her Majesty's Government have, in taking charge of Swaziland, taken upon themselves a task of great embarrassment. How have the Government got into this position of embarrassment? The most experienced High Commissioner of our time advised them not to take over Swaziland. They acted against the advice of Sir H. Robinson. They then sent out a special Commissioner, Colonel De Winton, and they acted against his advice also. My right hon. Friend the Under Secretary said that all the embarrassing concessions are subject to the decision of the Courts. No doubt many of the smaller and less important of these concessions are being brought before the Courts, but the most important, such as the postal, telegraphic railway, banking, and Customs concessions, have been actually purchased by the Government of the Transvaal, and in the opinion of the law officers of the Crown that Government are within their legal rights in obtaining possession of these concessions. Looking to that state of things, it is clear the House will agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Her Majesty's Government have certainly got a most embarrassing bargain in Swaziland.
 SIR JOHN POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty if he will state the total annual cost of the Marines; the

 MR. JOHN KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether the Regulations of the Post Office respecting sick leave are in accordance with the provisions of Clause 9, sub-section (1), of the Order in Council of 21st March, 1890, and, if not, whether he is prepared at once to issue instructions for carrying the Order in
 470
 MR. J. MORLEY : When will the right hon. Gentleman produce the Papers?
 MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether any Proclamation has been issued by the Military Commanders at Suakin as to the intentions of the Egyptian Government towards the tribes; whether any terms have been made with the tribes in the neighbourhood of Suakin and Tokar, for the purposes of common action against the approach of hostile forces from Kassala; and whether at the fall of Afafite and Tokar, any prisoners were captured; and, if so, in what way they have been disposed of?
 MR. J. MORLEY : May I ask for particulars as to the detention of the prisoners? On a former occasion I believe many prisoners were taken away and sold as slaves.
 MR. J. MORLEY : That is what I said.
(5.50.)  MR. J. MORLEY : I think the right hon. Gentleman was not in his place when the remark fell from the Chancellor of the Exchequer which gave rise to this discussion. Upon the right hon. Gentleman's last remarks I would ask him one plain question. If you wanted £4,000,000 last year, why did you not ask Parliament to vote it then and there? Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer will give a plain answer to that when the opportunity arises. What the Chief Secretary has just been saying about the Navy of the country is really beside the mark. First of all, and as a matter of fact, I do not believe the First Lord of the Admiralty would say that a ship takes longer to build now than it did in 1879, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer laid down these sound doctrines. But the point we want to get at is the avowal made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Government adopted this policy not because ships takes longer to build, or from any point of view of that kind, but because, as he said, "We might be superseded by gentlemen on the other side of the House in the Government, and we want to anticipate that risk of supersession; and, therefore, in fact, we take out of you, the House of Commons, the power of saying what should or should not be done."
 513
 MR. J. MORLEY : Surely. What was the avowal of the right hon. Gentleman? That it was expedient and Constitutional for the Government to withdraw from the control of a future House of Commons the expenditure upon Her Majesty's Navy. The right hon. Gentleman said, in effect, that he resorted to this new system, which he denounced in 1879, in order that, if his Government were superseded by a Liberal Government, the present naval policy of Ministers might not be thwarted. What more unconstitutional position could a Chancellor of the Exchequer take up? Surely the controlling authority of this House is based upon the constant, steady, annual supervision of the annual expenditure. That is the most fundamental of all constitutional doctrines; yet the right hon. Gentleman wishes to prevent a new House of Commons, that may disapprove the naval policy of his Government, from interfering with their plans, and in order to baulk the new House, and to frustrate the will and intentions of the constituencies, he resorts to this system which the right hon. Member for Derby has denounced. By his bold and audacious avowal the Chancellor of the Exchequer has shown that he must have forgotten what he said in 1879. He then said—
 "The fact was, the House had lost power as to the expenditure of the country through the introduction of this distinction between ordinary and extraordinary expenditure." 505
(5.25.)  MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : The right hon. Gentleman, in his closing words, referred in the most distinct manner possible to the doctrine of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian, when he attacked this particular system of finance. I venture to think that a more unconstitutional doctrine was never so audaciously avowed; and this is the doctrine which the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself so courageously denounced in 1879.
 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : How much of the charge is due to questions put in the House? It seems to me the Colonial Office are entirely ignorant of colonial matters, unless questions are put to them by hon. Members, because when we ask questions they immediately telegraph, utterly regardless of the expense. The ignorance displayed by the Colonial Office shows the great necessity of hon. Members putting questions across the floor of the House. The best the right hon. Gentleman can do is to promise us a return of the cost of the different
 521
 MR. ROWNTREE  (Scarborough) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if his attention has been drawn to the continued and excessive drinking at public houses disclosed by the evidence in the inquest on the late Whitechapel murder, in which Sadler was described by two witnesses as "very drunk, and the deceased woman was stated to be half dazed with drink;" if it is correct that 2,309 persons were apprehended during the year 1889 for drunkenness in the Whitechapel police district; how many of the holders of licences in that district were proceeded against for permitting drunkenness during that year, and with what results; and if he will consider whether steps can be taken either to make the law, or the administration of the law in the Metropolis, more efficient in checking drunkenness?
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I hardly think it is necessary to call specially for the information desired by the hon. Member, as, if he will compare the net earnings with the amount of debenture capital and rate of interest it bears, which are to be found in the Returns of Railway Capital already published, he will practically obtain what he wants.
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he has yet received a Report from the Chief Commissioner in regard to the evidence of the police as affecting their conduct in the case of Sadler; and, if so, whether he has any objection to lay it upon the Table?
 MR. ESSLEMONT : Can access be obtained to the official evidence?
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : Will the right hon. Gentleman say at the same time whether he will allow a full discussion upon the Second Reading of the Bill?
 MR. DUFF : I do not want to raise the question at length now. If the noble Lord is not prepared to go into the matter at this moment I will ask him a question on the Shipbuilding Vote.
 MR. DUFF  (Banffshire) : Reference has been made to the statement in the  Times
 MR. R. G. WEBSTER  (St. Pancras, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether information has reached him that the agents of the Midland Railway Company or others are pulling down houses in Somers Town, St. Pancras, and, in consequence, evicting many of the inhabitants, without having previously erected dwellings for those displaced; and, as this is not only a severe injury to the evicted tenants, but a serious damage to the trade of the neighbourhood, whether he will have steps taken to have the strict spirit of Section 33 of "The Midland Railway (Additional Powers) Act, 1890," stringently enforced, in the interest of the inhabitants of Somers Town?
 MR. R. G. WEBSTER : Will the right hon. Gentleman state the name of his adviser?
 MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether he can state the number of opium shops which are licensed by the Government in India, and whether they amount to more than 10,000; (2) whether his attention has been drawn to a statement that the consumption of opium in Lucknow has increased from 36,240 tolas in 1883–4 to 64,320 tolas in 1887–8, and whether he has reason to believe that this statement is correct; (3) whether he can state if the consumption of opium in India is increasing generally; (4) whether his attention has been drawn to a meeting called by the Chinese Authorities at Singapore to petition Parliament to put a stop to the opium trade on account of its injurious tendency; (5) whether he is aware that nearly half the revenue of Singapore is derived from the opium traffic; and (6) whether, seeing that in Great Britain it is unlawful to sell opium except by a duly qualified and registered druggist under stringent regulations and labelled poison, Her Majesty's Government will take into consideration the expediency of adopting similar provisions with regard to its sale in India?
 *MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I would reiterate the question of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton. Does the Under Secretary mean that this large increase
 523
*(9.15.)  MR. BUCHANAN : The right hon. Gentleman the Undersecretary was in possession of the House, and if he desires to proceed I will not stand in his way. There are one or two points to which I should like to direct attention. In the first place, with reference to the concessions in Swaziland, I referred not to the mining rights, but the concessions acquired by the Transvaal Government postal, telegraph, banking, Customs, &c.; and the point of my argument, enforced by the Report of Sir Francis de Winton, was that our partnership with the Transvaal is not
 545 Hansard 546
 *MR. BUCHANAN : I was referring to concessions of taxes. I understood the Transvaal had purchased the concession of Customs duties and postal rights.
*(7.37.)  MR. BUCHANAN : I desire to call the attention of the House to the item of £5,000, a moiety of the deficit to be granted in aid of Swaziland. As to the agreement with Swaziland, what has practically been done is that we have entered into a joint Government of Swaziland with the Transvaal, and the statement of Sir Francis de Winton that there is no finality about the arrangement is confirmed by the resolution of the Transvaal Republic—that the joint agreement is a transition measure. I perfectly allow that the hands of the Government and of the Prime Minister were forced in this country by those who were interested in various financial enterprises in Swaziland. With regard to the financial aspect of the question, Sir F. de Winton, in his Report, says that nearly
 535 536
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : That must be the inevitable result; because, as I have
 493
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : If the hon. Member thinks it is to the public interest and to his own personal satisfaction to publish that correspondence he is perfectly entitled to do so.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I have to express my regret that the hon. Member should think it right to address this question to me. I wish to point out to him, what I have pointed out in the letter which I sent in answer to the letter addressed to me by the hon. Member, that it is the policy of the Government, of Parliament, and I might almost say of the Constitution, to respect the complete and absolute independence of the Judicial Bench. The Government have no authority whatever over a Judge of the land. The Government have no paternal or disciplinary authority in any way over a Judge of the land; and I have pointed out to the hon. Member that if he has reason to believe there is a failure of justice it is in his power, as well as in the power of any other hon. Member, to move an Address to the Crown for the removal of the Judge in question. That is the only course open to any hon. Member, whether he be a Member of the Government or of Parliament. I should earnestly deprecate any suggestion that it is the duty of the Government to bring pressure to bear on the Judges based on reports in news-papers, or on statements which are in any way deficient of allegations of positive fact as to the failure of justice. I must, decline, with all respect to the House, to discuss by question and answer across the floor of the House the conduct and capacity of any one of the Judges of the land.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I am afraid it is not in my power to promise the facilities which my hon. Friend asks for; but the Session is not so far advanced that he may not hope himself to find an opportunity of pressing a measure which I know finds favour with a very large number of Members. I am not at present able to say what course the Government would take in the event of my hon. Friend's failing to obtain the judgment of the House on his proposals.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I beg pardon. I will not further refer to the Debate of Friday, but I will merely add that I learnt on Friday, through the usual channels of information, that there was no prospect whatever of the Government reaching Supply that evening. I hope that the House will now consent to proceed with business.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The Motion, if carried, would have that result.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I cannot agree with my hon. Friend that there is no chance of discussing this Bill on Wednesday. There is only one other Order of the Day before it; and if it is the desire of hon. Members that a discussion should take place, the preceding business might be disposed of by 2.30 or 3 o'clock, so as to enable the Eight Hours Bill to be taken up.
*(4.20.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : The hon. Member has taken a curious method of punishing the Government for failing to keep a House on Friday. The hon. Member proposes practically to deprive private Members of their day for bringing forward Motions.
 *THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : No, Sir; I am not in a position to make a statement.
*(6.38.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : Perhaps I may be allowed to say a word on the subject, and before I do so let me say that my right hon. Friend had no intention of making this increase any ground for reproach on hon. Members for asking questions. I am asked, what statement was made to the Treasury which induced the Treasury to sanction this Supplementary Estimate? and to this I have to say that the original Estimate—which, as hon. Members are aware, was £3,500—was represented to us in December as being insufficient, there having been a great deal of telegraphing during the first nine months of the year. Having regard to the fact that the Estimate would almost certainly be exceeded, we thought it better to provide for another £500 to meet the expenses that might be incurred in the latter part of the year. It may be that this amount will not be expended; it may be that only £100 will be spent. I do not anticipate that the whole sum will be required, but I hope the Committee will agree that we do right in providing for contingencies that may arise.
 MR. JACKSON : That comes on a later Vote for the Colonial Service-That is a Vote by itself.
*(6.45.)  MR. JACKSON : The hon. Member is quite right. The Committee did make certain recommendations, and subsequently a Departmental Committee went thoroughly into all the questions of staff and recommended certain alterations, and it is to meet the increased expenditure that the Supplementary Estimate is necessary. The £300 is to meet expenditure in the current financial year which was necessary upon these tables. These have been in preparation for some years, and it was estimated the total cost would be £10,000 for 10 years. They ought to have been completed this year, but it was found they could not be completed, but it is expected they will be completed next year. Rather than delay the work, and to get the advantage of the tables at the earliest moment, we sanctioned an expenditure of £1,000 in excess of the original estimate. The work has taken 10 years, and will be of great advantage to Friendly Societies.
*(6.42.)  MR. JACKSON : Perhaps the hon. Member will allow me to explain that. The only reason it is necessary to take a Supplementary Vote at all is that the Companies Winding Up Act has been passed since the Estimates were framed, and the Board of Trade could not incur any expenditure else, the expenditure being limited to the Bankruptcy Department. It is necessary to take this Vote as a matter of regularity and routine. My right hon. Friend anticipates that £700 may be required during the current financial year, and the fees are expected to cover that amount. The hon. Member may rely upon full effect being given to the Act.
*(7.20.)  MR. JACKSON : Yes; certainly.
 *MR. JACKSON : There has been a slight increase in the expenditure owing to the fact that there have been more candidates for examination, and that there have had to be more examiners. The increased expenditure, however, has been more than covered by the additional fees received.
*(7.26.)  MR. JACKSON : We have tried for some time past to do that. These examinations are held at particular times, and temporary accommodation has to be obtained, which involves the necessity of hiring rooms. The Vote is in consequence of an increased number of candidates and a corresponding increase of examiners. They have rendered increased accommodation necessary. The receipts in fees are estimated at £700 more than they were last year. It was not my intention to convey the impression that the system at present adopted was bad, because it is quite obvious that if the total cost grows there should be power given by the House to provide for that additional expenditure. The original amount was £3,647, but it was found necessary to spend £3,778. The system of book-keeping adopted is a good one. Vote agreed to.
*(11.58.)  MR. JACKSON : The accounts for each year are kept separately.
 *MR. JACKSON : The price of silver has fallen considerably—from 54 pence to 44 pence an ounce in the last year.
*(11.55.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. ; I must ask to be excused from going into the whole question, and as to regulations concerning India—payments there do not come from the same fund, and I have no knowledge on the subject. I must leave that to my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary for India. But in regard to the present Vote, I may explain that during the past eight years there has been a gain to the Treasury Chest on the exchange of about £90,000. But this year, owing to the change made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in favour of soldiers and sailors, the Treasury Chest has suffered a loss of about £15,000.
 *MR. JACKSON : I should have thought the hon. and gallant Gentleman would have known that the rate of exchange is more or less governed by the price of silver.
 *MR. JACKSON : It represents the balances held by paymasters in different parts of the world. The exchange is fixed at the beginning of each quarter, and if it goes against us there is so much
 571
(12.8.)  MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : I want to ask what steps the Government will take to make the Guardians obtain security where it is possible to do so? I do not think there will be in most cases any security worth having, but where there is I want to know what steps will be taken?
 MR. WILLIAM M'ARTHUR  (Cornwall Mid. St. Austell) : I beg to ask the Secretary of Stats for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the circumstances attending the funeral of Mrs. White, a member of the Wesleyan Society, at Loddon, Norfolk, on the 11th February last; whether he is aware that the Vicar of Loddon was duly advised that the body was to be buried in the churchyard without the rites of the Church of England, pursuant to "The Burial Laws Amendment Act, 1880;" and that upon application being made to the sexton for the bell to be tolled at the funeral, that official, in reply, exhibited the Vicar's notice—namely,
 "The Act of Parliament respecting funerals which are not taken by the Clergy of the Established Church does not contemplate the tolling of the Church bell; the bell therefore will not be tolled at funerals except when conducted by the Clergy of the Church of England;"
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, with the view of preventing the multiplication of "tied houses" in the various parts of the country, the Government will consider the advisability of calling the attention of the Licensing Authorities to the recently issued Return with respect to On-Licences, in which will be found the number of persons in each district, and the names of such persons who are on the register as owners of two, three, four, and any greater number of premises in respect of which On-Licences have been granted, with the number of such licences attached to each name?
(4.54.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : This is a very serious matter and is one of the first fruits of that extraordinary confusion into which the
 497 498 "The fact was, the House had lost its power as to the expenditure of the country through the introduction of this distinction between ordinary and extraordinary expenditure." "While they hunted with the hounds they ran with the hare. After singing 'Rule Britannia' at Conservative dinners all over the country, with might and main, they come down to this House, as the First Lord of the Admiralty did the other night, to confess themselves the devoted and convinced disciples and champions of 'Peace, retrenchment and reform.'" 499 "It is an exhibition of an apparently strong policy carried out by weak men—I do not mean weak intellectually, but men wanting in the nerve and courage to face unpopularity. They had shown a want of confidence in the willingness of the country to bear the burdens, which were the result of their policy The whole secret of these extraordinary Budgets—this doctrine of spreading the expenditure of untold millions over a series of years, is to induce the people to agree to it, on condition that they shall not be bound to pay for it at present, but at some future time when it may be convenient." 500 vice versâ
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Then I hope L may be allowed in one sentence to answer the right hon. Gentleman by saying I traverse the statement that London has lost under this system as compared with the rest of the country. I have observed an ominous silence on the part of the Secretary to the Treasury on this question, and he is the man we really ought to hear, because he is the vindicator of the public purse in this matter. He knows very well that the public purse is being robbed as it ought not to be robbed; and though he will not speak in opposition to the Vote, I hope he will enter the Division Lobby against it.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I am answering what the right hon. Gentleman has said.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Although it is no doubt true that the whole question was gone into carefully when the County Councils were created, still this is a matter which should stand on its own footing. Of course, to tie a question of this kind on to any re-adjustment of the whole system would be practically to defeat the course of justice. I am not at all confident that those who are the recipients of the bounty of the right hon. Gentleman have any reason to be thankful for it. In the parish in which I live in the country, I inquired what the effect of the benevolence of the right hon. Gentleman had been, and I found that the rates had been raised 4d. in the £1.
(6.52.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : This is a very old controversy. My right hon. Friend (Mr. H. H. Fowler) has raised it over and over again, and the only defence which could be made in past times was that London had no municipal representation, and, therefore, this Charge was put upon the Estimates. With the extension of municipal government to London the Charge is no longer defensible. This was fully recognised in the Bill I introduced for the better government of London, this Charge being placed upon the inhabitants of London. Now that London has a County Council, I cannot see how this Charge can in justice to other Municipal Bodies be made a national Charge, and I hope we shall have an undertaking that in future this Charge shall be transferred from the Exchequer to local finance. If not, I shall certainly vote with my hon. Friend as a protest, for undoubtedly this should be a matter for the constituted Local Authority—the London County Council.
(6.3)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I should like to ask the First Lord one question. He will remember that the most important part of his statement last year related to the proposal to reserve a large number of ships which would be available on an emergency at very short
 516 Times
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Our charge is that you have destroyed the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I beg your pardon. I did not say the objection had not been taken; it has always been our objection. But what I said was that it had never been avowed before that it was intended to defeat the will of the country and of future Parliaments. It has never been said before, and never been answered, that it was in order to defeat the Government or the Parliament elected by the country.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : The House of Lords is not dissolved; the House of Commons is.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : The House of Commons.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I did not recommend a loan. I said it would have been more straightforward and honest, though it would still have been a bad plan.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Oh, no; the exaggeration is on your side.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : At any rate, I am very much surprised that we have had the avowal from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the whole policy of the Government has been deliberately adopted for the purpose of keeping the control of the naval expenditure out of hands of the House of Commons. I protest against any such doctrine. I think that this Debate is thoroughly justified, inasmuch as it has brought out before the country and the House of Commons quite clearly what is the object of the policy of the Government, namely, to destroy the control of the House of Commons over our naval expenditure, and that for seven years, whatever the country or the House of Commons may say or desire, or whatever the Government which enjoys the confidence of the country, may think Parliament has determined the matter by an Act which we cannot vary except with the consent of the House of Lords. I have always thought the principle of control by this House was accepted by both Parties; bat it now appears that it is only the Liberal Party that will have to maintain for the future the doctrine of the supremacy of this House over the National Expenditure. At any rate, that doctrine is repudiated by the Party which is represented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I had thought that the doctrine of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was sufficiently laid down in his speech of 1879; but he says he has shunted that doctrine just as he has abandoned a great deal more since that time. The doctrine which has hitherto been upheld by this House has been that, as a general rule, the money wanted to meet the expenditure of the year should be provided out of the resources of the year. There are exceptions to that rule, where the particular circumstances or exigencies may require a different course; but where it is necessary to vary the rule, the necessity ought to be frankly and fairly stated to the House. I have never yet heard any Government or Administration avow that they have deliberately adopted a plan by which, for seven years, they intended
 510
(5.31)  SIR W. HARCOURT : We have heard the arguments put forward by the once Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer in favour of what I call "ship-money." All the principles of the Constitution, all the control of Parliament over the National Expenditure, are thrown over by the right hon. Gentleman the Liberal Unionist Chancellor of the Exchequer. What, I ask, has become of the constitutional control of the House of Commons? The right hon. Gentleman says, "We put it into an Act of Parliament, which you can alter if you like." Yes, with the consent of the House of Lords. It is thus the control of the House of Commons over the Expenditure of the country is deliberately destroyed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and he does this because he fears a dissolution may come, and that another Government may sit in the places occupied by himself and his colleagues. That, I repeat, is the constitutional doctrine of a Chancellor of the Exchequer who was once a Liberal, and who made the speech

*(9.24.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I desire to say a few words upon this drink question. It is, of course, not a new one, and, under various aspects, it has been under public discussion since American and African colonisation first began. I understand that under this Convention we are to have no control over the drink traffic in Swaziland, but we may well ask how it comes about that we have no such power or control? How is it that a responsible Government does not take care of this, which the people of this country consider of the greatest importance? Of course, we understand that the Tory Party, having special interest in the drink question, do not look upon these matters so keenly as we do; but the people generally have the strongest sense of the iniquity of native races being ruined by the supply of strong drink. Swaziland, we understand, is to be governed by three Commissioners, one of whom is the Representative of this country. Cannot we instruct our Representative to take care that the question is dealt with? It is almost an absurdity to suppose that we have no influence in the matter. I am afraid the Government are not sufficiently alive to the importance of this question. Surely they must have the power if they care to use it. When I was in Canada, a good many years ago, I found that the colonists had made it a crime to sell or give ardent spirits to the Indians. Surely if the Colonial Authorities could do that the Imperial Government can do something of the same kind. It has been a reproach to our Christianity that we go among native races with the Bible in one hand and the whiskey bottle in the other; and hence it is that our efforts at civilisation are so often treated with contempt. I hope we may have an assurance that, through our Representative on the Commission, every effort will be made to stop the

 *MR. MORTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman say why the Government had not taken power in the Convention to deal with this drink question?
 *DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I understand none of this money is intended to pay any of the expenses connected with the expedition to Witu in November last.
 *DR. CAMERON : No, not at all.
 *DR. CAMERON : I beg the right hon. Gentleman's pardon. I do not propose anything of the kind.

 SIR CHARLES LEWIS  (Antrim, N.)  I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he can explain why the children attending the Ballymoney Model School who live in Ballymoney have been prevented going to their homes during the play hour for meals, although this advantage has been enjoyed by the children for at least 20 years; whether he is aware that the parents unanimously memorialised the Commissioners of National Education, as also the Town Commissioners of Ballymoney, to permit the continuance of this practice, and that the prayer of the Memorial was granted to the extent of only two months, which expired at the end of last year, and that, though a second largely-signed Memorial wsa forwarded to the Commissioners expressing dissatisfaction with their reply to the first, praying for this benefit to be con-

 MR. POWELL  (Wigan) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the Government is prepared to give facilities for the passing in this Session of the Bill to exempt public elementary schools from the payment of rates; and whether, if not so prepared, the Government will introduce a Bill in the course of the Session to relieve such schools from the oppressive burden which they now bear in consequence of their liability to the payment of rates?
*(11.26.)  SIR G. BADEN-POWELL  (Liverpool, Kirkdale) : The hon. Gentleman says nobody but only some vague Jingoes uphold the present system. I personally was very much against the arrangement made, but I see definite reason for adhering to the arrangement. We have, after consultation with the Government of the South African Republic, come to this conclusion, and we are bound by treaty to maintain this system for three years. I do not think it would be consistent with our honour to break the treaty. In the second place, we have to uphold existing rights, but I think we have made arrangements by which a distinction can be drawn between concessions which are ridiculous and those which are reasonable. I think the arrangement entered into will be excellent, as far as the natives are concerned. I do not think you can stop drunkenness among native races by mere control of the liquor traffic. What is far more effectual is to establish a civilised and strong Administration, and I hope that the result of our three years of temporary joint control in Swaziland will be to establish a proper Administration, which will effectually control the terrible curse of drunkenness in the native races.
 MR. BARTLEY : On a point of Order, I beg to ask whether this is relevant to the Vote?
(6.59.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : I quite agree that London should pay for its own Police Courts, and I think the time has come for making the change, but I do not know that the right opportunity offers itself upon a Supplementary Estimate. It does seem to me, though I do not always approve of the action of the London County Council, that that is the authority to be entrusted with the duty of raising the money for this expenditure, and on another occasion I shall support a proposal for transferring this Charge to the Local Authority.
(6.41.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I should like to have some information as to this expenditure. Though the nominal sum is £10, the expenses are really £700. I am very glad to find the Government find it necessary to spend £700 to give effect to the Companies Winding Up Act, and hope it may be the means, under that Act, of preventing those frauds such as we find daily brought to light in the Courts of Law in connection with the management of Joint Stock Companies. I should like to know what measures have been taken for the efficient working of the Act and the bringing to justice those who come within the clutches of the law.
*(7.27.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I desire to take exception to the item of £600 for the Anglo-French Mission to settle the boundary of Gambia. I would suggest that we should do away with this expense by getting rid of Gambia altogether. There has been a good deal of talk about the place, and it has been clearly demonstrated that it is of no use to us, being surrounded and enclosed by French territory. It is a sort of thorn in the side of the French in Africa. We have what I may call a "roughness" with the French in Newfoundland, and they are dissatisfied with something we are doing in Egypt; therefore I think it would be a good thing to throw a little oil on the waters by handsomely presenting France with this colony. Mention was made of this question in a letter which appeared in the  Daily Graphic 533
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : I do not attach importance to anonymous letters in newspapers, but still I should like to know whether there is this drunkenness in the colonies.
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : I could have quoted other letters to a similar effect.
(9.34.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I am not prepared to submit to the House of Commons a plan for dealing with Swaziland, but I sympathise very much with what was said by the hon. Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Buchanan) to the effect that, whilst we are more and more committing ourselves to dealing with Swaziland, we are not in any way getting out of the difficulty in which we are placed. We have imposed upon ourselves a very heavy responsibility in regard to the liquor traffic. The right hon. Gentleman tells us Her Majesty's Government are desirous of diminishing the liquor traffic as much as possible.
 549
(6.20.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : I do not desire to raise the whole question of Colonial Policy on this Supplementary Vote, but I think I am entitled to ask for some information on important events that are now taking place. Two or three days ago there appeared in the  Times
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I think we may assume that the inquiries were on the subject of questions asked in the House, and therefore, probably, you, Sir, will rule that we may raise a Debate on those questions.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Then I should like to know whether any part of the telegrams for which a charge is made in this Vote had reference to the passing of the Act giving Responsible Government to Natal? I am obliged to abide by your ruling, Sir, but I am afraid that ruling will tend to the discussion being confined in very narrow limits.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Yes, Sir; but I submit that the sending out of telegrams is a very important matter.
 SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL : I beg-to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the Bill to establish responsible government in Natal, passed by the Colonial Legislature, has been received by Her Majesty's Government; whether Her Majesty's Government had intimated to the colony the general conditions on which the Government were willing to advise Her Majesty to allow such a change; whether, subject to minor questions of detail, those conditions have been complied with; whether he will lay the Bill and Correspondence before the House; and whether the Government will delay advising Her Majesty to give her sanction to the Colonial Act till the House has become cognisant of what is being done and has had, in some shape, an opportunity of discussing it?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : May I ask if it is the duty of any public official to prosecute for such an avoidance of the law?
 MR. KIMBER  (Wandsworth) : I beg to ask the right hon. Gentleman when the Memorandum of Data and Reasons on which this Bill is based, and which he was good enough to promise, will be issued; and whether he will defer the Second Reading of the Bill for a sufficient period to allow of the Memorandum being publicly ventilated and considered by the many trades and industries affected?
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I cannot give further particulars, but I have no reason to believe that the prisoners would be harshly treated. I know that after the engagement at Tosti, on the Nile, all who were not considered dangerous were allowed to return to their villages, or were given land in Lower Egypt, and that even when the Dervish prisoners were released they preferred to stay where they were.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : A telegram has been received to the effect that a Proclamation has been issued by the Military Commander stating that the Egyptian Government has resumed its authority in the district about Tokar, calling on the tribes to repel the Dervishes, and granting amnesty to all except some notorious slave dealers; also that there is no intention of retiring from Tokar. Definite arrangements will not be made till the Sirdar has returned to Cairo. Of the prisoners taken 231 were released, and 300, including families considered dangerous, are for the present detained. Sir Francis Grenfell had ridden through the neighbouring country and had found it quiet and clear of Dervishes. The people were rejoiced at the re-appearance of Government in their neighbourhood.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I believe that the Papers on the subject are almost ready.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : The hon. Gentleman is not to understand all that from my answer. I am not in a position to give more particulars than I have already given.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I did not refer to those who had been "rightly struggling to be free," but to those who have been harrassing the country and raiding about Suakin.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : (1) 10,417. (2) The attention of the Secretary of State has not been drawn to the statement referred to, but the consumption in Lucknow has increased in the proportion stated. (3) The consumption is slowly increasing. (4 and 5) Are matters for the Colonial Office. (6) The Secretary of State is not prepared to adopt such a provision.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : That is a question which I am not in a position to answer.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : The Secretary of State has not been called upon to consider the merits of the case, but only the operation of the Regulation which has already been referred to.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : (1) Abdul Rasoul was offered: The refund of his expenses since arrival in November, 1890; a passage to Bombay, and permission to return to Kashmir. (2) He was sent to London at his own request. (3) If Abdul Rasoul demands compensation, he should address himself, in the first instance, to the Government of India, and, in the event of their refusing him redress, appeal to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is not in possession of information which enables him to state the cause of complaint or prefer any charge. (4) Abdul Rasoul has been informed that he will not be arrested in the absence of fresh offence.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : In the absence of my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary for India, I have been requested to answer the question. (1) Regulation III. of 1818, as stated on the 16th of February. (2) No. (3) No. (4) It was retained in the interests of public safety. (5) The Secretary of State considers that it would be detrimental to the public interest to publish such a Return. (6) No.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : By a despatch received to-day from Her Majesty's Ambassador, it appears that there had been some attempt to restrict the unloading of cargoes to the members of an  Evnaf
 MR. BRUNNER  (Cheshire, Northwich) : It can do no harm to allow this Bill to go forward this stage. If it is necessary to alter the terms of this clause at a later stage the alteration can be made.
*(12.13.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : Before the Bill is read a third time I should like to draw attention to the extraordinary fact that the Minister for Ireland—the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant—is not present in his place when this important and urgent measure, which so particularly applies to Ireland, is being brought forward.
*(11.20.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I should like to ask the Under Secretary whether he has taken into consideration the future arrangements in Swaziland, because there is no worse government than a dual government? There is in Swaziland a dual control—half British and half Boer. Would it not be possible to come to an arrangement to divide the country into two portions and have one portion under the supreme control of Great Britain, and the other portion under the control of the Transvaal? The present system will lead to the utter destruction of the native tribes; all the Europeans' vices and none of their virtues will be introduced.
 *SIR J. SWINBURNE : I only wish to say it is most desirable that soldiers and sailors should be paid in currency, the amount representing the real value of their pay. I know from personal experience how in former times both officers and men suffered very material loss from being paid in Government paper, which was only encashed by merchants as a favour, and at a large discount.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : It would not be my duty to institute a prosecution.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : My attention has not been called to any such advertisements or prospectuses, but, having regard to the practices which were attempted under the Act of 1867, I think it quite possible that such advertisements may have been issued. The practice would rather be an avoiding than an evasion of the Act of 1890. It would not be a criminal offence.
 MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether, having regard to the difficulty of passing a larger measure through Parliament, the Government will introduce a Bill to allocate a portion of the £20,000 he proposed to spend upon the Bann Drainage, in order to relieve flooding, and discontinue a navigation little used, which imposes a tax of £1,200 a-year on the ratepayers?
 SIR W. HART DYKE : I believe some complaint has been made, but it seems to me reasonable that the Training College Authorities, upon whom the responsibility rests of selecting the successful candidates for admission, should

 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : I have seen Mr. Kynnersley's statement; but if the right hon. Gentleman had pursued his investigations a little further, he might have observed that the Inspector goes on to notice the extraordinary fluctuations to which the population of Birkenhead is liable. That being so, I prefer to await the result of the forthcoming Census before expressing an opinion as to the accuracy of the Registrar General's estimate. The number of school places in Birkenhead

 *THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : I do not wish to impede the progress of the Bill, but I desire to point out that I have consulted the Law Officer of the Crown as to whether that for which provision is made in this clause can not be done under the terms of the original Act. I hold the opinion that it could—that under the existing law fees can be paid by County Councils as proposed—and my view has been sup-

(5.59.)  SIR W. PLOWDEN  (Wolverhampton, W.) : I think we ought to have some explanation of this sum of £350,000 extra expenditure in respect of steam vessels. The First Lord and his advisers, when they framed their Estimates, must have had a very accurate knowledge of triple-expansion engines, and they ought to have been able to frame them in such a manner as to avoid this extra expenditure of £350,000 being asked for. I would ask the First Lord whether there is any difference between the conduct of these triple-expansion engines in Her Majesty's Service and the conduct of such engines in the Merchant Service? If there is no difference, why are not the Estimates properly framed?
 MR. MAC NEILL : Is the right hon. Baronet aware that two native gentlemen, members of the Viceroy's Council, have protested in the strongest terms against this taxation of salt?
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The answer to the first part of my hon. Friend's question is Yes. The second part is argumentative, and appears to be framed under some misapprehension. Cyprus is not a British Colony or under the sovereignty of the Queen; but it is occupied and administered under special arrangement with the Sultan, with which my hon. Friend is, no doubt, familiar. I may, however, observe that there are many cases in which some annuity is paid out of the Revenues of a British Colony to the former ruler or his descendants, in compensation for the loss of income arising from the cession.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : In 1889 the Jamaica Government Railway was sold to a company incorporated in the colony, and brought out by an American Syndicate. As a part of the conditions of the sale, the syndicate undertook to construct extensions of the railway to Montego Bay and Port Antonio for which they were to receive a square mile of land for every mile of the extension. The Secretary of State, without expressing approval of the scheme, considered that it should be left to the decision of the Colonial Legislature. Papers, including a copy of the Colonial Law under which the sale was made, and which sets out in a schedule all the conditions, will be presented to Parliament. I would also refer my hon. and gallant Friend to the very full reply given to him by me on the 27th of June, 1889, which contains the answer to the question which he now repeats.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : To South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia, 7s. 1d. per word; to New South Wales, 7s. 3d.; to Queensland, 9s. 9d.; to Tasmania, 9s. 11d.; to New Zealand, 10s. 6d. The second question could not be precisely answered without long examination. It is roughly estimated that the cost of the telegrams sent from the Colonial Office to Australasia during the past two years has averaged £700 a year. As regards the third question, many, but it cannot certainly be said all, the telegrams sent from hence on that subject were paid for out of the Vote for 1888–9.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : No final decision has yet been arrived at, and no statement can be made on the subject until a communication has been made to the Colonial Government.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he has received a communication from the Irish Cattle Traders' and Stockbrokers' Association, directing his attention to the injury inflicted on Irish cattle dealers, farmers, and stock raisers, in consequence of the recent restrictions in the scheduled districts of Lancashire; whether these restrictions are imposed because of local disease in Lancashire; whether there is pleuropneumonia or other infectious disease amongst Irish cattle; whether all Irish cattle undergo veterinary inspection before shipment; and whether, having regard to the fact that these restrictions give an advantage to American competitors, they will be modified to the extent of allowing the free movement of Irish fat cattle?
 MR. PROVAND  (Glasgow, Blackfriars) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what sum is contributed by land to Imperial taxation, stating the amount received from each source separately, and the percentage which the whole bears to the total of Imperial taxation?
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : I am afraid that I cannot answer the question without further notice. I must, therefore, ask the hon. Member to defer it until I can make inquiry.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am not aware that any grants have been made by Local Authorities in Ireland under the Technical Instruction Act of 1889. The City Council of Belfast have, however, added £300 to the rates for 1891, to be devoted to such schools as come within the scope of the Act. The facilities offered under the Act were duly brought to the notice of the Local Authorities by the Local Government Board for Ireland, who issued, in November, 1889, a circular to each such authority, inclosing a copy of the Act. As regards grants for handicrafts or manual instruction in national schools in Ireland, the figures for 1890 are not yet available; but for the year 1889 the total amount of the grants for such purposes was £28,296, and the number of schools which shared in these grants was something above 5,000.
 MR. BAUMANN  (Camberwell, Peckham) : I am glad to hear the remarks of my hon. Friend.
 MR. WINTERBOTHAM  (Gloucester, Cirencester) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether his attention has been called (as,  ex officio e.g
 MR. CALEB WRIGHT  (Lancashire, S.W., Leigh) : I bag to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that, notwithstanding his expression of opinion to the Reverend W. J. Melville, Rector of Holy Trinity, Ashton-in-Mackerfield, Lancashire, that such an instruction is contrary to the spirit of the Burial Act of 1880, the bills issued in connection with interments in the churchyard still contain the instruction that breadths or graves are
 "appropriated only on condition that no other than the Church of England service is ever used";
 MR. FOLJAMBE  (Notts, Mansfield) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether his attention has been called to the case of a working man named William Purdy, of Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire, who, while living in a house for which he had never paid more than 6s. a week rent, was assessed for Inhabited House Duty, and, despite his explanations, and before a promised survey of the premises, had a distraint issued on his goods in August, 1889, for the amount of duty demanded; whether a second demand for Inhabited House Duty was made in 1890, and a second distraint only avoided by the payment of the amount claimed, by a neighbour anxious to prevent the disturbance likely to arise; whether, in all, 23s. for duty claimed, and 5s. 6d. for expenses, have been received in respect of this assessment, since declared unjust by the Commissioners; and whether he will request the Inland Revenue Authorities to refund the money?
 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether his attention has been called to the great increase of deaths in India during the years 1886–8, and especially to the increase of deaths from fever; and in view of this great increase in the fever death rate, the Government will consider the duty of taking steps to promote better conditions of health among the people?
 MR. CONYBEARE : Can the right hon. Baronet say whether the deaths from 1886 to 1888 from fever were in excess of those of the bad years from 1870 to 1879?
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether, in the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay, the price of salt has risen from nine annas and eight annas per maund in 1800 to R2.11 and R2.8 in 1890, respectively; (2) whether he can state the facts as to increase or otherwise in the price of salt for the other Presidencies during the same period; (3) whether in India the average consumption of salt per head for all purposes is only 101b., while in the United Kingdom it is 721b.; (4) whether it is a fact that leprosy has also increased during the same period; and (5) whether the Government will direct the especial attention of the Medical Commission on Leprosy now in India to an investigation of the apparent connection between the want of cheap salt and the spread of leprosy?
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India (1) how many persons have been arrested on suspicion and imprisoned without trial or deported under Regulation III. of 1818 since that date to the present time; (2) whether the said Regulation is printed in any of the official records of the India Office; and (3) why it has never been embodied in the Indian Penal Code?
 MR. CONYBEARE : Upon that answer may I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether I did not understand him to say yesterday, in answer to a question of mine, that Mr. Henry Silk Buckingham was deported under Regulation III.?
 MR. CONYBEARE : The question which I put to the right hon. Gentleman yesterday bearing upon this matter was whether Sheikh Abdul Rasul had not been deported under the same Regulation as applied to the case of Mr. Henry Silk Buckingham in 1818. What I want to know is this; if Regulation 3 of 1818 does not authorise deportation, under what Regulation was Sheikh Abdul Rasul deported, his declaration being that he was deported against his will?
 MR. CONYBEARE said : There is one point in the question, upon which I wish to ask a further question, namely, how many persons have been arrested on suspicion and imprisoned without trial or deported under Regulation III. of 1818, since that date to the present time? I think I understood the answer of the right hon. Gentleman to be that the Regulation did not authorise deportation, I do not ask for names and particulars but can the right hon. Gentleman give me the number of persons who have been imprisoned during a certain period without trial merely on suspicion?
 MR. CONYBEARE : Could not the right hon. Gentleman get the information?
 MR. GRAY  (Essex, Maldon) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether there is any foundation for the report that frozen meat badly preserved, or of inferior quality, supplied to soldiers at Colchester, and other garrisons, has given considerable dissatisfaction; and whether he would consider the advisability of supplying the Army with fresh killed meat, which is obtainable in Great Britain and Ireland at from 4d. to 6d. per pound?
 *MR. RITCHIE : It is my intention to propose the appointment of a member of the Royal Commission on Vaccination to take the place of the late Mr. Bradlaugh.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : Prior to the notice of the question of my hon. Friend I had received no information with regard to the application for allotments at Charlton Kings. I have communicated with the Local Board, and have received a letter, from which it appears that an application was made to them for allotments by several individuals resident at Ryeworth. The Local Board proceeded to make inquiries with regard to the applicants, and they found that almost all of them were already provided with allotments or garden grounds. It is not stated in the communication which I have received that the Local Board have been unable to supply the demand owing to the unwillingness of the owner of the only suitable land in the locality, but I am informed that since the last meeting of the Local Board a communication has been received by them, in which it is stated that a portion of the land known as Ryeworth field is to be offered for sale in the present month, and suggesting that the Local Board should exercise their powers with regard to this field. This communication was to be considered by the Local Board at their meeting today. The Local Government Board have no such information as to the facts as would enable them to make any recommendation to the Local Board as regards this particular field, and as, in the event of its purchase, application would, no doubt, be made to the Board for sanction to a loan, and a local inquiry would be necessary, it would not be expedient that they should do so.
 MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether it has been decided by Her Majesty's Government what proportion of the expense of maintaining the forts and garrison of Trin-comalee is to be borne by Ceylon, and what proportion by the Imperial Government?
 MR. SEALE-HAYNE  (Devon, Ashburton) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, having regard to the dissatisfaction which exists in certain quarters with reference to the present method of appointment, and the required property qualification of Justices of the Peace, he will consent to the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the causes of this dissatisfaction, to which the Bills dealing with these subjects, now before Parliament, may be referred?

 "That, in the opinion of this House, the ensouragement of more general voluntary provision for sickness and old age should engage the attention of Her Majesty's Government, and that the sound principles of provident insurance should be included in the subjects prescribed by the Education Code for instruction in elementary schools." 607 "A body established to provide for its purposes by the voluntary contributions of its members, with or without the aid of donations." Blackwood's Magazine status 608 "It cannot be too strongly insisted on that the Registrar cannot ensure the good management of Friendly Societies, and that the mere fact of registry affords no guarantee that a society is solvent or even honest." 609 "There is no subject which excites greater sympathy than the case of agricultural labourers or other wage earners who make contributions towards a fund for providing for their sickness and old age, and then find their hopes disappointed." 610
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : I am glad to learn that the Friendly Societies Registry has been re-organised. I was aware of that, but I think the House will agree with me that a large number of the recommendations remain to be considered and acted upon by Her Majesty's Government. The most im-
 611 "The present system of registration of Friendly Societies cannot be considered satisfactory. If greater powers were given to the Registrar in connection with the registration of Societies rules, and with a view to the securing of an efficient audit, the proper investment of funds, and the protection of benefit funds from any inroads upon them for management expenses, it is believed that registration would he of far greater value to the members of these Societies." "To inquire into the operation of the Act which authorizes the Post Office to grant annuities and issue policies of life assurance." "The Committee attribute special importance to encouraging in every possible way the habit of making some provision for old age," &c. 612 "Any amount of efforts have been made to puff—nay, to bring before the public—the real and incontestable advantages offered by the Post Office at lower rates than speculative companies, but the seed has fallen upon stony ground. The Postmaster General has 10,000 offices open at which he conducts annuity and insurance business. He pays his officers for every contract they secure. He distributes leaflets from house to house. He fills savings bank books with advertisements, and has invented attractive placards, but the results are not encouraging. Arrangements have been made under which, through the agency of provident and friendly societies, the payment in advance of the first year's premium, which is usually required, is dispensed with. Moreover, the members of friendly societies are allowed to pay their premiums in weekly, monthly, or quarterly instalments from the commencement, receiving at once their contracts, which take effect from the date of issue." 613 "The admirable motives, labours, and results which form the history of the higher order of Friendly Societies caused the Committee to treat with great respect the strong objections brought against the scheme by the affiliated orders." "The disinterested patience and energy with which Canon Blackley laboured to remove the causes which tended to drive the poor into the workhouses." 614 615 616 617 "That it is highly desirable that the Legislature, which had made education compulsory, should cause instruction in sound principles of thrift and insurance to form part of that education."
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : I beg to say that I have consulted a great many of them.
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : A great many of them do.
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : I said 562 in the last five years.
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : Under all the circumstances, I will now ask leave to withdraw my Motion. I think the discussion that has taken place will have done considerable good, and I believe that Her Majesty's Government will, at any rate, take into consideration that part of my proposal which embodies the educational recommendation of the

 MR. QUILTER  (Suffolk, Sudbury) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of

 MR. PLUNKET : The question of providing a suitable building for the new Gallery of British Art has been for some time engaging the careful consideration of the Government, and it is hoped that a satisfactory scheme may soon be agreed upon.
 MR. PLUNKET : It would be better not to enter into that subject at present. I hope to be able to make a fuller statement in a short time.
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University : The proposal to allow bathing in the Regent's Park has more than once been fully considered, but it has always been rejected, mainly on the ground that the ornamental water is so close to inhabited houses.
 MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Member cannot have inspected the place as carefully as I have on more than one occasion, or he would have found that there is no spot on the ornamental water free from the objection I have named.
 MR. DAVID THOMAS  (Merthyr Tydvil) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the increasing practice in Welsh steam coal collieries of winding large quantities of coal through the upcast shaft; and whether, in view of the fact that this practice materially interferes with the ventilation and safety of the mine, he will take steps to insure that proper precautions, such as passing the trams through double doors at the surface, are taken?
 MR. D. THOMAS : Does the Inspector approve of the practice?
 MR. DAVID THOMAS : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will again direct the particular attention of Mine Inspectors to Rule 39 in the General Rules under "The Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1887," relating to the employment of inexperienced workmen underground, which Rule it is alleged is being constantly broken?
 MR. DAVID THOMAS : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury if, in view of the fact that South Wales has during the past few months been the scene of several severe struggles between employers and employed, and that all efforts to form Conciliation Boards at Cardiff have proved futile, he will impress upon Her Majesty's Government the desirability of having both Parties in the district duly represented upon the proposed Royal Commission on Labour?
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : A comparatively small area of 150 acres is buoyed off for a few weeks at Sheerness in order that the Regular and Militia Submarine Miners may have their necessary practice. It is possible that some inconvenience and loss are occasioned to fishermen, but my hon. and gallant Friend must be one of the first to be aware that this practice is essential in the interests of the Public Service.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : No recent complaints have been received on the subject of frozen meat, and none whatever as regards frozen mutton. Frozen beef is not now issued to the Army, although some refrigerated beef is, as it enables the Authorities to issue to the troops some of the best procurable beef. But, whenever due regard to economy admits of it, I shall always try to give the preference to home-grown meat of good quality.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The new magazine rifle was tested for range in August last at Romney Hoy by the Committee on Explosives. The extreme range was found to be about 3,500yds.
 MR. WHITLEY  (Liverpool, Everton) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the attention of Her Majesty's Government has been called to a statement in the  Times Journal des Débats
 MR. GROTRIAN  (Hull, E.) : Before the question is disposed of, I should like to say a few words on the subject. I regard the question as one of great importance, and I do not like to allow it to be disposed of without venturing, even at the risk of detaining the House for a few moments, to offer one or two remarks upon it. I may say that I entirely agree in the sentiments expressed by the Mover and Seconder of the Resolution, yet I must confess that, according to my view of the matter, the adoption of this Resolution would be both inexpedient and impracticable. I must express my own conviction that the leading Friendly Societies would resent State aid in any form. They hold that they are quite capable of managing their own affairs; and, although there have been some defects in the management of certain Friendly Societies, yet, on the whole, it is shown that the leading societies are admirably managed. Reference has been made to two of the leading Friendly Societies of England, and I may say, with regard to those two societies, I know that when on a former occasion State aid has been suggested, they have resented any such intervention. Those societies are fully alive to the defects which characterise the management of friendly institutions of this kind, and are endeavouring in their own way to remedy those defects. I hold in my hand the 109th Report of the Kingston-on-Hull District of the Ancient Order of Foresters, a society which is numerically the strongest in the United Kingdom, and that Report shows that particular attention is being paid to the question of solvency. It says—
 "We cannot bat express our regret that only one Court in the district shows a surplus of assets over liabilities."
 CAPTAIN PENTON  (Finsbury, Central) : I had intended to ask the Secretary of State for War whether, in view of the acknowledged deciency of rifle ranges accessible to Metropolitan Volunteer Regiments, his attention has been called to the fact that a company has been formed with the object of establishing rifle ranges available for Metropolitan and other corps near Staines; and whether the scheme has his sanction or approval? But at the request of the right hon. Gentleman I will postpone the question until Monday.
 CAPTAIN PENTON : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War if he can inform the House when, where, and by whom the new magazine rifle has been tested for range, and with what result?
 MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S.E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he is aware that great inconvenience and loss is occasioned to Essex fishermen by the placing of torpedo buoys, wires, and chains, fastened together near the surface, on Sheerness Middle Ground, of Garrison Point, Shoe-bury ness, and whether he will consider the possibility of removing them if compatible with the interests of the public?
 MR. GOSCHEN : Two applications were made to Mr. Purdy in the year 1888–89 for a return of the annual value of his house. These applications remaining unnoticed the Local Commissioners of Taxes fixed the assessment at, £23, taking the gross poor rate as a basis of charge. Notice of charge and the date when he could appeal were given to Mr. Purdy, but no communication was

 MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Member asks me to embody information on an extremely difficult and complicated subject within the limits of an answer across the floor of the House. There are, however, no existing Returns which give the information for which he asks.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I am hopeless as to explaining the question of the Turkish Tribute in its relation to Cyprus to my hon. Friend. When Cyprus was taken over the payment of a Tribute amounting to something like £90,000 was made a condition of the transfer of Cyprus. It is an engagement to Turkey, and an engagement which cannot be broken for the sake of lightening the taxation of Cyprus. On the other hand, Turkey has to find the interest on the Crimean Loan guaranteed by England and France, and the bulk of the Tribute is applied to that purpose; if not applied to that purpose, it would have to be handed over to the Porte, and no part could be remitted in the interests of the taxpayers of Cyprus. The Tribute is, as my hon. Friend is aware, charged on the Revenues of Cyprus, which Revenues have also got to meet the cost of administration. The Revenues are insufficient for that purpose, and a grant in aid has annually to be made. It is, therefore, difficult to say how much Cyprus pays towards the Tribute; it is assisted in that payment by the grant in aid made by this country. The question of capitalising the Tribute is still under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government, but no great anticipations of large relief to the inhabitants of Cyprus ought to be formed as the result of a capitalisation.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The surplus laid up in the Treasury has been held back as applicable to a Sinking Fund on the guaranteed amount.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I cannot state the exact amount; but I think it is something like £50,000 or £60,000. It is an
 587
 MR. GOSCHEN : My answer to the first question is No. My answer to the second question is No. One collector had irregular notices privately printed in ignorance of the rules; but only such notices can be issued as have been prepared or approved by the Board of Inland Revenue. I think there is some confusion with regard to these notices. The hon. Member for the Uxbridge Division put a notice in my hands which was irregular, but the hon. Member who asks me this question has sent me one which is perfectly regular, but which, perhaps, he believed fell into the same class as that which was un-

(7.22.)  MR. HOLLOWAY  (Gloucestershire, Stroud) : I rise to give my best support to the Motion of the hon. Member for Sheffield. As I have had considerable experience in establishing and assisting in the management of Benefit Societies, I think I can explain to the House exactly what is required to bring about an enormous improvement in the usefulness of such societies throughout the country, and in doing this I wish if to be distinctly understood that I do not desire to say a single word against the Chief Registrar, nor against any of his assistants. I am very much afraid that the greater part of their labour is wasted and thrown away upon the working men throughout the country, whom it does not deter from joining and investing their money to unsound and untrustworthy societies. Our Reports of the Registrar are very interesting to this extent: they show us that there is an almost universal desire amongst working men to belong to some kind of Benefit Society, and they show us that thousands of societies which working men join are utterly unsound and worthless. But they do not show us upon what principle Benefit Societies could be founded to secure absolute safety to those who invest in them. That is the chief defect of the present system, and I venture to submit that the time has come when a costly public Department should give the people the benefit of great experience by formulating a set of standard rules, upon the very best and soundest principles, and should recommend those model rules for adoption to all who night apply for them. No others should receive the stamp of registration. I think it is a melancholy state of things

 *MR. BROADHURST : I am informed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle that the number of annuitants is 1,115. The subject of Post Office Insurance is very little known among working men. There is no systematic advertisement. No doubt, there are notices lying about on the counters of post offices; but no effort is made to make the system well known and to attract the attention of a large number of people. In 1881–2–3 I was in constant consultation with the late Mr. Fawcett, when that gentleman was giving his great mind to this subject; and one of the suggestions which I made to Mr. Fawcett was that there should be as short an abstract as possible made out, with just the main features of the scheme printed in large type, and that employers and proprietors of works should be invited to place these notices in the most prominent part of their works, so that every opportunity should be given to the people to thoroughly master the proposal. I believe that by those means we would secure a much greater number of insurances being taken out. I do think that the limitation of deposit in any one year should be raised beyond £30, and this would have been done on more than one occasion had it not been for the rather unwarranted and unworthy opposition of the banking interest on both sides of the House. Now, the hon. Member who seconded the Motion spoke with great warmth of the degradation of becoming a State pauper in old age. There is degradation, but I think that it attaches not to the people themselves, but to the nation which has received the labour of the man, and perhaps of his wife, for 50 or 60 years, in the

 *MR. BROADHURST : Very well, Sir; but if the hon. Gentleman's constituents are used to such things, we, in this House, have not been used to them. There was one other characteristic displayed in the speech of the hon. Member, to which I listened with equal surprise. The hon. Gentleman charged the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer with "nobbling." He

 *MR. BROADHURST : The annual gathering of one of the greatest Orders of the Friendly Societies will shortly take place, advantage may then be taken of the opportunity to obtain the views and opinions of that Order upon this question. If I may venture to offer an opinion on the matter, I would say that the proposal which has to-night been submitted by the hon. Member for Central Sheffield will not be looked on with favour by the members of that body; but that on the (contrary those proposals will be opposed very strongly, and in all probability by a very large majority. If you are going to endow these Friendly Societies with a regular subscription from the Government, it will follow that the Government must of necessity have agents and Representatives on the Boards of Management of those Societies, and not only that—because the Boards of Management are not the only persons who discuss financial matters—but the Government will also have to insist on having a Representative in every lodge and branch of each of the great Orders of Friendly Societies. I think the hon. Member was rather uufortunate in mentioning specific societies as being particularly sound. I do not object to the description of those he mentioned. On the contrary, I believe the great Orders of Oddfellows, Foresters, and Shepherds are in a good, sound state financially. But the only misfortune in mentioning those societies was that the hon. Member left out of

 *MR. BROADHURST : He says he has consulted a great many of them; but do they approve of State endowment?
*(5.48.)  MR. BROADHURST  (Nottingham, W.) : One of the remarkable features of this Debate, as far as it has yet gone, has been the unexpected development of strong socialistic tendencies on the part of the hon. Gentlemen who have moved and seconded this Motion. Perhaps none of us have ever been much surprised at the bold suggestions that have come from the hon. Gentleman the Member for Central Sheffield (Mr. Howard Vincent). That hon. Member has more than once favoured the House with very remarkable suggestions in connection with trade and commerce, and to-night we have hardly been astonished at the new development into which he has embarked in his proposal for subsidising the great Friendly Societies. But, Sir, when an even older Member of the House, and one equally honoured by us—a county Representative, a Chairman of Quarter Sessions, a gentleman to whom we have looked to lead and guide us in the sound principles appertaining to national affairs and constitutional questions—comes forward and at once throws himself at the feet of the highest order of Socialism, there seems to be something debasing in the process; and I think it will be equally surprising, not only to the hon. Gentleman's friends, but also to his constituents, when they have read his extraordinary declaration.
 *MR. BROADHURST : The hon. Member's constituents may be used to some surprises, but hardly, I should think, of the direction and character of that we have had to-night.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : Yes, Sir; the facts are as stated in the first four paragraphs of the hon. Member's question. With regard to the fifth, Irish cattle when they land in England, are subject to neither more or less restrictions than English cattle. I am afraid I cannot make any exceptions in their favour, and I do not understand in what respect it is that the restrictions give an advantage to their American competitors.
 MR. CHAPLIN  said: I believe that fat cattle when landed are obliged to be slaughtered independent of whether they are landed in a scheduled district or not.
 MR. MATTHEWS : An inquiry is now being held, and it includes the grievances of all classes of warders.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I stated last year that if the hon. Member would bring to my notice any instance of disregard of the Rule I would do all in my power, by issuing instructions to the Inspectors to secure its proper observance. I have referred the hon. Member's question to the Inspector for the South Wales district, and he states that while the Rule is an exceedingly difficult one for managers to enforce, owing to misrepresentations sometimes made by colliers seeking employment, yet he is constantly making inquiry, and has no reason at all to
 592
 MR. MATTHEWS : He says that it is not desirable it should be extended?
 MR. MATTHEWS : My attention has been called to this practice. There has been very slight increase in its application daring the last four years. The Inspector reports that the practice does not materially interfere with the ventilation and safety of the mine in any of the cases where it is in operation in the South Wales district, and that the cages used in the upcast shafts fill the mouth of the shaft. The Inspectors will take care that the adoption of this practice, which is not contrary to the Coal Mines Act, does not interfere with the adequate ventilation of the mine under the first General Rule.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : The opinion which I expressed to the Rector on a former occasion was to the effect that it appeared contrary to the spirit of the Act to stipulate beforehand that a grave where a Church service is used shall be in any respect superior to other graves. The Rector then assured me that this is not the case, and he now repeats this assurance. The Rector, however, still insists on his right to select the part of the churchyard where any interment shall take place, and denies any obligation to sell or appropriate graves to any families or individuals to the exclusion of others. This is a question of law, as to which I have stated before it is not my duty to express an opinion. The Rector informs me that no dissatisfaction has been expressed among his parishioners, and that the provisions of the Act of 1880 are always loyally carried out by him.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, Sir; the Memorandum mentioned by my hon. Friend was prepared by my authority, and may be treated as a short and explanatory statement upon certain points on which information appeared to be desired. A much fuller Memorandum, as I have already stated, will shortly be laid upon the Table of the House.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Lunacy Commissioners that Mrs. Cathcart was taken in the Strand outside the Law Courts. It is a matter entirely for the Court itself to determine whether there has been any contempt of Court. The hon. Member will see from the Lunacy Act, 1890, that prior to an

 MR. MATTHEWS : I am advised that the answer to these questions of my hon. Friend is in the negative. The power to act as a Middlesex Justice, although there is no Middlesex residence, is confined to those persons who were qualified Middlesex Justices when the Local Government Act passed.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : Letters transmitted by post between countries of the Postal Union are exempt from charge for re-direction under the Regulations of the Postal Union Convention. The hon. Member must be aware that the Postmaster General has no authority or power to remit charges producing revenue without the sanction of the Treasury.
 MR. STEPHENS  (Middlesex, Hornsey) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether a Paper, containing various statements in support of the Inflammable Liquids Bill, printed at the Foreign Office on the 2nd of this month, but presenting no other indication of its origin, has been issued upon his authority; and, if not, whether the Paper may nevertheless be accepted as an official Memorandum of explanation in support of the Inflammable Liquids Bill?
 MR. BIGWOOD  (Middlesex, Brentford) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he could inform the House whether a Justice of the Peace who is on the Commission of the Peace for a county in England, and is duly qualified by estate, and has taken the Oath of Estate and made and subscribed the Declaration of Office, is subject to any penalty for acting as Justice of the Peace at a Court of Quarter or General Sessions by reason of his having no residence within the county; and can any valid legal objection be made to a Justice so acting on the ground that he is not resident within the county? I have also to ask the right hon. Gentleman if he can inform the House whether there is anything to prevent a Justice of the County of Middlesex, who is duly qualified by estate, and who was appointed a Magistrate of Middlesex prior to "The Local Government Act, 1888," continuing to act at Quarter Sessions as a Magistrate for Middlesex, notwithstanding the fact that his place of residence and qualification, which was in the County of Middlesex, has become by virtue of the provisions of "The Local Government Act, 1888," now within the County of London?
 DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to the seizure of Mrs. Mary Cathcart, if he is aware that the lady was seized by four servants of a Private Lunatic Asylum within the jurisdiction of the Law Courts, when she was there for the purpose of pursuing an action in one of the Courts; whether such seizure amounts to contempt of Court; if he will state whether it is legal to seize any person under what is called an "urgency order," and confine the said person in a lunatic asylum before any medical examination has been made, or any medical certificate signed for his or her detention; and whether he will give an order for the examination of Mrs. Cathcart by two independent medical men?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the condition of a vast proportion of the population of the Gweedore district of Dunfanaghy Union; whether any part of Ireland can show a worse condition than is to be found in the Meenacladdy, Bloody foreland, and Brinlack portions of this district; what measures he proposes for the relief of this misery; whether his attention has been called to the consequences that must result next year owing to the fact that no seed potatoes have been provided for the Gweedore district, and whether he purposes making provision to prevent the famine that must ensue next year if seed be not promptly provided now; and whether it is by any fault of the Poor Law Guardians of the district that no seed has been provided; and, if so, whether he can compel this Board of Guardians to perform their duty in this crisis, or whether he will take steps to save the people from the consequences of their neglect?
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : I have seen the paragraph in the  Oban Times 585
 MR. JESSE COLLINGS  (Birmingham, Bordesley) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he is aware that an application for allotments under the Act of 1887 has been made to the Local Board of Charlton Kings by the labourers of Ryeworth; that the Local Board have been unable to supply the demand owing to the unwillingness of the owner of the only suitable land in the locality; and that the said land is now offered for sale; and, if so, whether he will advise the Local Board to purchase it, or such part of it as they may think fit, for the purpose of supplying the applicants with allotments?
 MR. DEASY  (Mayo, W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he is aware that Mr. Sweeny, contractor for the erection of the Achill Sound Bridge, was obliged to go outside the County Surveyor's specification owing to the nature of the foundations of the bridge; whether he is aware that, in consideration of the extra work executed by Mr. Sweeny, the Grand Jury of Mayo, who with the Board of Works defrayed

 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been called to a fatal accident to a girl, on the 19th February, by a passing train at the Butler's Hill crossing on the Nottingham and Mansfield branch of the Midland Railway; whether he is aware that there is a heavy mineral and passenger traffic at this crossing, which is a frequently used public footpath; and whether, by the erection of a bridge or other means, the safety of the public can be secured?
 MR. HENNIKER HEATON  (Canterbury) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies what is the cost per word for British Government telegrams from England to Australia; what amount was paid during each of the past two financial years for Government telegrams to Australia; and whether the expenses incurred in telegraphing to Australia, in reference to the appointment of the Governor of Queensland, vice Sir Anthony Musgrave, was taken out of last year's Financial Vote or the Vote in a previous year?
 MR. MACNEILL  (Donegal, S.) : May I ask the right hon. Baronet if the increase in leprosy is not owing to the increase in the taxation of salt? Was not the taxation of salt reduced in Lord Ripon's time?
 MR. BEAUFOY  (Lambeth, Kennington) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether an inquiry is about to be held into the grievances of prison officials; and whether this inquiry will include the grievances of warder schoolmasters?
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : Yes, Sir; and I have communicated with the Midland Railway Company, and am informed that the immediate

 DR. McDONALD : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he has been informed that the notices for distraint in reference to the payment of Income Tax, which he referred to last week as having been issued without instructions, and further issue of which had been forbidden, still continues to be issued after he had made this statement in the House; whether such notices are printed by Government printers, and distributed to the various collectors who make use of them; whether he is aware that they are delivered at houses without being in envelopes or folded up in any way, and consequently are open to the inspection of servants, or to that of visitors, when thrust under the doors; and can collectors distrain for taxes at any time after 1st January, even if the ordinary demand note has not been received by the taxpayer?
 DR. FARQUHARSON  (Aberdeenshire, W.) : What arrangements have been made for the reception of works of art?
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON : Can my right hon. Friend tell me how much money has come from Cyprus, and what is the amount of the surplus now laid up in the Treasury?
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON  (Shropshire, Oswestry) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he can inform the House what is now the sum total of money derived from the taxation of Cyprus under the name of Turkish Tribute and applied towards the payment of the interest on the Crimean
 586
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON : I beg to give notice that I will call attention to the question on the Estimates.
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether a sum of £92,000 a year is still charged, under the head of Turkish Tribute, upon the taxpayers of Cyprus, and is still applied by the British Government towards the payment of the interest on the Crimean Loan guaranteed by England and (France; and whether there is any precedent in any other colony or dependency under the Colonial Office for a charge over and above the costs of administration being levied out of the local taxation and applied to Imperial purposes?
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON : What is the amount?
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the existing railways of Jamaica described in a Despatch of His Excellency the Governor "as a good and paying property," have been handed over to an American Syndicate, together with a grant of 100,000 acres of land, and the right to make railway extensions to Montego Bay and Port Antonio; whether these conditions had the previous sanction of the Colonial Office; and whether he will lay the terms of the concession upon the Table of the House?
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : Are there not convenient places about the islands free from the objection?
 MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works if he will permit bathing in the ornamental lake in Regent's Park before 8 o'clock in the morning during the summer months?
 MR. T. ROBINSON  (Gloucester) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he will consent to appoint some one to take the place of the late Mr. Bradlaugh upon the Royal Commission on Vaccination?
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether any grants were made towards technical instruction in Ireland during the year 1890 under the Technical Instruction Act of 1889; if so, for what particular branches of such instruction these grants were made, and what was the total amount in each branch; whether any steps have been taken to bring the facilities thus offered under the notice of those in Ireland for whom they were intended; if so, of what nature; if no such steps have been taken whether he will see what can be done in this direction; what was the total amount of grants for handicrafts or manual instruction in national schools in Ireland during the year 1890; and how many schools shared in these grants?
 COLONEL SANDYS  (Lancashire, S.W., Bootle) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether Her Majesty's Government are aware that an appeal from the recent decision of the Archbishop of Canterbury on serious issues affecting the Church of England is now

 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to-do with the selection of the members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council who are to try any particular appeal.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : The number of licensed houses mentioned in the Return as held under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners as owners would appear to be approximately correct. The Commissioners have for some years past aimed at reducing the number of public houses found existing upon the estates which have from time to time fallen into their possession— e.g

SMITH : The question of abolishing the property qualification required by law for Justices of the Peace has recently been discussed in the House of Lords, and a Bill for such abolition was rejected on its Second Reading.

HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N) : In listening to the speeches of the Mover and Seconder of the Motion, I was bound to draw a broad line of distinction between the sentiments which animated them and the proposals which they put before the House. With the sentiments they have expressed and the objects they have in view, I am in entire sympathy; but I agree with the hon. Gentleman who has just sat down that the particular proposals which they have advocated are unsatisfactory and impracticable. The hon. Gentleman (Colonel Howard Vincent) talked in a loose sort of way of the State contributing 5s. or 10s. a year in respect of each member of certain Friendly Societies, in order to provide pensions for their old age. But the sum that would be produced in this way would be infinitesimally small. In the case of a man 40 years of age, and who continued to make subscriptions till he reached the age of 65 years of age, it would yield him a few pence per week. The hon. Member will see the total insufficiency of his suggestion if he remembers that under the Scotch Police Superannuation Scheme the House last year provided a sum of £10 per year per man, in addition to the subscription of 2½ per cent. of his means by every member of the Force. The House will perceive, therefore, that these somewhat crude suggestions are

 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : On the recommendation of the Fishery Commissioners, a grant of £1,500 was made for the building of Achill Viaduct, and it was made conditional that the work should receive the approval of the County Surveyor. I can hold out no hope of the Board of Works making good any loss incurred by the contractor.
 MR. JACKSON  said: The Board of Works have no power to make any further contribution.

 SIR J. FERGUSSON : As to the first question, duties have recently been fixed by an arrangement between France, Portugal, and the Congo State under the provisions of the Declaration annexed to the Brussels Act.

 SIR J. FERGUSSON : I have no detailed information on that point, but it is the fact that deaths from fever were very numerous in 1887, when there was a very heavy rainfall, and that they were lower in the next year—1888.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. 581 Chatham : The statistics will be found at page 268 of the Statistical Abstract. They do not show a progressive increase in each year in the total number of deaths or in the number of deaths from fever, which latter depend in a great measure on the season. It should be remembered that the system of registration of vital statistics is being steadily improved, and, that, as the improvement continues, a steady increase in the number of registered deaths may be expected. Sanitary reforms are attempted, so far as the means and the sentiment of the native population permit it. In the rural tracts progress is necessarily slower than in the towns. The question is engaging the constant attention of the Secretary of State and the Governor of India.
 MR. LENG  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he will direct the attention of Her Majesty's Minister in the United States of America to the fact that, while complete sets of the publications of the British Patent Office are-presented to 12 of the most important cities in those States, a corresponding number of sets of the publications of the United States Patent Office are not sent to similar cities in this country, and that inventors in Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Dundee, Belfast, and other cities are put to the inconvenience of visiting London to consult the only set of United States Patent Office publications accessible to them in this country?
 *SIR J. PULESTON  (Devonport) : It may, perhaps, save time if I say that there is no desire on the part of the promoters of the Bill to oppose the Motion of my hon. Friend. Notice of opposition was given yesterday simply because the Motion was seen on the Paper for the first time, and it was thought desirable than an opportunity should be afforded for looking into it.
 *SIR R. PAGET : I beg the hon. Member's pardon; my constituents are used to precisely the same suggestions as I have had the honour to make to-night.
 *SIR R. PAGET : They are well used to it.
*(5.11.)  SIR R. PAGET  (Somerset, Wells) : I rise to second the Motion, and I desire to express the satisfaction with which I have listened to the able and comprehensive review by my hon. and gallant Friend, of an intricate and interesting subject—the questions connected with Friendly Societies. Speaking generally, I am disposed to agree with the conclusions at which my hon. Friend has arrived. I will content myself with a few words in support of the principle contained in the Motion which stands in my name on  the "That, with the view of inducing Friendly and Provident Societies to place themselves in a position of financial security, some contribution might reasonably be afforded by the (State to such societies as are able, after actuarial valuation, to obtain a certificate from a public auditor that their resources are adequate to secure to all their members the whole of the benefits offered by their existing regulations." 619 620 621 laissez faire " Laissez faire laissez faire 622 personnel 623 624 625
*(3.3.)  THE MARQUESS OF GRANBY  (Leicestershire, Melton) : I cannot help regretting that the hon. Gentleman (Mr. H. Gardner) has made the speech to which we have just listened, because it appears to me that that speech introduces into the Debate a polemical and Party feeling which cannot assist the object of the Bill—an object which I firmly believe is held in favour by every section of the House. On the whole I frankly admit I am entirely in accord with the Bill of the hon. Member for the Bordesley Division, and shall willingly vote for its Second Reading; but I think I would be unwise if I were to vote for the measure without criticising some of its provisions, with which I do not entirely agree. In a part of the constituency, which I have the honour to represent, there has been for many

 MR. CRAIG : After that explanation from my hon. Friend I withdraw my objection.
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : May I ask if the Government agree to this Bill?
(5.53.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : Are we now to understand that the Possession of Game Bill is supported by the Government? In consequence of Members passing out of the House I did not hear the title of the Bill as it was read by the Clerk, and many Members, I know, had no knowledge of the nature of the Bill. But I understand that the Government are supporting the Bill; is that the case?
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : In the form in which the hon. Member makes his proposal this would not be consistent with the Army Act or the Naval Discipline Act. As it is a matter requiring some further consideration, perhaps it will be better to adjourn the discussion now.
(5.46.)  THE PATRONAGE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. AKERS-DOUGLAS,  Kent, St. Augustine's : As the branch of the subject to be investigated by the Committee this Session entirely affects Scotland, in accordance with the promise given by my right hon. Friend, certain Scotch Members have been nominated to the exclusion of others. As regards the question raised by the hon. Member for Merthyr, it is a reasonable proposal that the Principality should be represented. As regards the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, certainly the alterations have not been made by me in consequence of any views he may have expressed in Committee upstairs, which have never come to my knowledge.

Ordered, That the Committee do consist of Twenty-four Members.

 *MR. LLEWELLYN : I beg pardon; what I wanted to point out was that men ought not to be induced to take up small holdings without capital, thinking they can make them pay, where, with ample capital, large farmers have failed.
*(1.25.)  MR. LLEWELLYN  (Somerset, N.) : It has been stated that an examination of the details of this measure is out of place in a Second Reading Debate, and should be deferred until the Committee stage; but I think there are certain details which should be dwelt upon now, lest in Committee, when there may not be much time at our disposal, they may escape notice. I am very glad to support the Bill, and wish to give my reasons for doing so in opposition to the different course I pursued a few years ago when a measure of

It is true, a few words of criticism have fallen from the noble Lord (the Marquess of Granby), but those criticism relate to a point which ought properly to be dealt with
 684
*(3.50.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : We have had a most interesting discussion" and I have listened with great attention to all that has been said. The discussion has been conducted with a remarkable absence of Party spirit, and it is evidently desired on all sides to arrive at a satisfactory solution of a difficult and complicated question. I am unable to agree with everything that has been said in the course of the Debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Lincolnshire (Mr. Cust) has spoken as though the time has come when the system of large farming in England should be discontinued. It is precisely on the large farms that during many years there has been the greatest expenditure in capital, science, and skill; and when the time of great depression arrived it was consequently on this class of farms that the greatest losses naturally fell. That great expenditure was followed by a long series of unpropitious seasons, the like of which no man living can remember, and after by a fall in prices, which I acknowledge shook the system to its very foundations.
 *MR. CHAPLIN : Well, that is my opinion; and if hon. Members will look into the subject, upon which they can form a judgment of their own, they will find that is about the average price at which good land of this description sells. Some gentlemen advocate cheap land for the purpose, and they think that large tracts of cheap land should be taken for small holdings. I differ absolutely from that opinion. I think it would be most cruel kindness to bestow upon any labouring man whom you wish to turn into a small freeholder to place him upon poor land, however great the extent. Thirdly, I am of opinion, and I have arrived at the opinion after giving the subject very considerable study, and having had the opportunity of seeing the results of the system, that it is necessary that the house and buildings should be included in the purchase price of the land, or the person who purchases must be in possession of house and buildings of his own. Otherwise the cost of building, added to the price of the holding, will probably swamp him in his undertaking. If these conditions are fulfilled I have no doubt the system may be tried with advantage and success; but if they are wanting, I believe—and it is my duty to state with perfect frankness the views I have formed. If these conditions are wanting I believe any system of the kind is foredoomed to failure, and in this belief I am, to a great extent, borne out by the experience which we have already in this country. As I have often stated in the House before, a system of small holdings is not new to this country. On the contrary, the system has been tried for years, and it exists at this moment over wide districts of the county I have the honour to represent; and any one who chooses may for himself witness the result
 702 703 704
 *MR. CHAPLIN : I am very glad to hear the explanation of my hon. Friend. I listened with great attention to his speech, and I certainly formed the opinion that he condemned with some severity the system of large farms. I am very glad to learn that such is not altogether the case. I know that system is frequently attacked in this country from various quarters, and I wish to remind the House that, before the period of depression, it was under the system of large farming that the country arrived at a pitch of agricultural prosperity such as has never been approached by any other country in the world. Even now, whether with regard to the character of the stock produced, or the amount of produce extracted from the land, this country stands far ahead of any other country in the world. The hon. Member for the Saffron Walden Division (Mr. Gardner) has referred to words used by me in 1882, which were hostile to the principle of this Bill. Well, 1882 was a longtime ago. I have not referred, so far as I know, to the speech I made on that occasion since then; but I have no doubt that the hon. Member is correct in the views which he says that I expressed. But what were the circumstances of the time? The country had just passed through a period of unexampled depression—depression of such severity that the House of Commons appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the condition of agriculture. I served on the Commission, and in the course of its inquiries there certainly were received most unfavourable and discouraging Reports as to the condition of the small freeholders, and especially of those freeholders who exist in such numbers in Lincolnshire. I certainly at that time quoted the opinion of Mr. Druce, who is well known as a highly qualified expert in agricultural matters. Mr. Druce is a farmer himself, and de
 695 "Your Committee have given full consideration to the arguments on both sides, and have resolved not to recommend compulsory power. 696 They feel that any scheme adopted now must necessarily be of a tentative character, and they are convinced that there is enough land obtainable by voluntary agreement to ensure a fair trial of the experiment."
 *MR. CHAPLIN : Well, Sir, for purposes of public utility any estate, of course, whether it be a large or whether it be a small one, must remain liable to the laws under which land may be taken now by compulsion for purposes of public advantage; but beyond this I know of no sufficient reason for this exceptional power in this case. What I am afraid of is this: that there will be nothing more likely to deter an intending purchaser of a small holding than these two conditions. By the first of which the land is never to be free from debt and three-quarters of the purchase money will remain a charge for ever; and by the second of which the Local Authority will have the power at almost any time to resume possession of the holding. What Englishmen like, what they cherish above all things, would be that which no one in the world can take away from them against their will, and of which nothing short of an Act of Parliament can deprive them. One of the chief inducements to purchase a small holding will be the knowledge that they have bought a property. I am quite satisfied myself that the object of Parliament in dealing with this question, if we are to deal with it at all, ought to be the endeavour to create a race of owners—I would say of trying to reproduce, if possible, that old race of yeomen which has almost ceased to exist—which should be dependent neither on a Local Authority, nor on a landlord, nor, indeed, on anybody else in the world but themselves. Now, the hon. Member for the Bordesley Division told us that his object in this was to guard against the evils of subdivision, of sub-letting, of mortgages, and various other evils prevalent on the Continent and in this country, also, at the present time in the case of small landholders. My answer is, that I believe that if the system which he advocates is a sound one, it will guard itself against these evils; but if, on the other hand, it is unsound, neither the precautions he desires to insert nor any

 *MR. CHAPLIN : I am aware that it is limited to 10 acres under the Bill. But, though I do not wish to take a hostile attitude on this point, I incline to the opinion that it will be better to avoid the letting of land by the Local Authority so far as it may be possible to-do so. Now, as to the making of improve-

 *MR. CUST : As the right hon. Gentleman is the fourth person who has attributed to me an attack on large farms, I may be allowed a word of explanation. I did not accuse the large farms of being the cause of the agricultural depression. I merely declared that the tendency has been to throw English agriculture into the hands of the large farmers, to the exclusion of small farming. I expressed

*(1.20.)  MR. CUST  (Lincolnshire, Stamford) : I venture, Sir, for the first time to-day to ask the indulgence of the House, because of all the subjects that have been under debate since I have had the honour of a seat in this House, I think the question of small holdings is the one in which my constituents feel and have the most vital interest. At the time of my election the strongest and safest ground on which I could appeal to the electors to support the Government was on the Government's agricultural policy. It is possible that a great many of them do not judge the merits of the two great Political Parties by very high standards of policy. They are most of them agricultural labourers, pure and simple, who are obliged to work on the land for their living, and who fail unfortunately, in a great many instances, to live by the land. I am quite certain, Sir, that it was not in any question of Home Rule, or any question of Disestablishment, not even in the ideal symmetry of one man one vote, that they felt a tithe of the interest and sympathy which they gave to the question of allotments and agricultural holdings. And, Sir, I think they were justified. Now, what was their position? They had a vote, it is true, which they were flattered into giving to one side or the other every four or five years, but in the intervals they were helpless and almost hopeless. They were as much bound to the soil and to the  status 662 status 663 664 665 666 667 "I recently purchased for University College a farm of 28 acres for £500, the rent of which was £30 a year. This is exactly a case where the tenant ought to have purchased. There was no reason why we purchased; it was simply as a good investment. I knew the farm was to be sold, made an offer for it, and it was accepted; but the tenant was really the right person to purchase and was very anxious to do so. Supposing that he could have gone to the Local Authority to buy his farm, he could, although he was unable to raise the £500, have been able to raise the one-fifth, namely, £100. That would have left £400 to be advanced by the Local Authority. That together, reckoning 4 per cent. on his £100, and the money advanced by the Local Authority, would make his yearly interest £20 instead of £30. And, supposing that he ultimately paid off three-fifths, it would be considerably less. At any rate, reckoning it at 4 per cent., no matter what he pail off and what he borrowed, he would be standing at £20 instead of £30. In that case, the tenant becoming holder, would have been immensely advantaged. And if the Local Authority bought it, the result of the whole calculation, if the man had paid off three-fifths, would have been that the Local Authority would have been in receipt of £8 a year perpetual quit-rent, and the man himself would have been benefitted by the transaction." "Yes, I think it would make the man a hopeful man, instead of an almost hopeless man." 668 669 670

*(1.15.)  SIR H. SELWIN-IBBETSON  (Essex, Epping) : In rising to second this Motion I will not occupy the attention of the House at any length. I, however, desire to say a few words on the Second Reading, because I have had some small opportunities of forming a fair judgment on this question. Before the Committee was granted in 1888 I advocated in Parliament and in the country the necessity of doing something of this kind for the purpose of reestablishing labour, if possible, in our midst. No one who lives in the country—in purely agricultural districts—can help being aware of the fact that the best part of our labouring population has been drawn away from the country by the supposed advantages of living in towns. I attribute much of that depopulation to the fact that the labourer has no inducement now to remain in the rural districts, and I am satisfied that if a prospect, or a hope, can be held out to the labourer that by industry, skill, and thrift he may be able to improve his social position, and perhaps to become even an owner of land himself, it will do much to give stability to our labouring population and to keep our best hands in the country. I watched the labours of the Committee, over which the right hon. Member for the Western Division of Birmingham presided, with a great deal of interest, and was glad to see that they practically gave the weight of their authority to the principle embodied in this Bill. The hon. Member for the Bordesley Division has stated many reasons in support of the Bill, but I will not go into details on the matter, because I fear that on some of them I may not be in accord with him. The point I mainly look to is to establish, if we can, the principle of small holdings

(2.50.)  MR. H. GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : The hon. Member who bas just sat down made one observation with which I am inclined to agree, and another with which I presume to take issue. He has stated that the principle of small holdings will never make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before. I join issue with that statement, and would remind him that Lord Derby once said, "The productive
 680
 MR. H. GARDNER : If I have misunderstood the hon. Member I apologise to him, but I must say that in my opinion the principle of small holdings is more likely to make six blades of grass grow where only one grew before. I have only intervened in this Debate because I not only take the greatest interest in this question, but I also represent a constituency, the population of which is mostly rural, and whose electorate consists mainly of agricultural labourers, who are a part of the community which both sides of the House honestly desire to assist by rendering their lives more happy and comfortable. The question of how to assist the rural population to raise themselves without violating economical conditions, how to raise the standard of comfort in the rural districts to something like the extent attained by those who reside in the towns, how to prevent the younger portion of the population migrating from the villages into our already over-crowded cities, and how to take away from this country the shame which rests upon us, that so many of our fellow citizens, after a long life of labour and privation as agricultural labourers, finally, end their days as paupers—this is a problem which deserves and ought to receive the serious attention of this House. I am convinced that one of the most important factors in the solution of this problem in regard to our rural population is the question of small holdings. The House has listened to several interesting speeches this afternoon and notably to the maiden speech made by the hon. Member for the Stamford Division of Lincolnshire (Mr. Cust), a speech on which I venture, and in no conventional sense, to offer my congratulations to the hon. Gentleman. But in that speech, as in many

 MR. JESSE COLLINGS : Will the right hon. Gentleman allow me to remind him that the proposal in the Bill applies to letting up to 10 acres, and the remarks of the Committee apply to larger holdings?
 MR. JESSE COLLINGS : For public utility.
(12.35.)  MR. JESSE COLLINGS  (Birmingham, Bordesley) : In moving the Second Reading of this Bill I think I am entitled to express satisfaction at the improved position which the question occupies. It has now been before Parliament for some years. The present Bill is only a small measure, and it proposes to provide facilities for the acquisition of land by the labouring population and others in the rural districts. In 1888 the Government granted a Select Committee to examine into the whole question. I welcomed that Committee with great satisfaction as an acknowledgment that the question was to be no longer dealt with as a visionary one, but that it came within the range of practical politics. The Committee was of a very representative character, and it sat for two Sessions, taking evidence from all quarters. After examining some 40 witnesses and taking interesting evidence on all parts and sections of the question, it produced a Report in 1890. I do not propose to detain the House by going into the details of that Report, but I trust that hon. Members will have studied, from the evidence, the chief difficulties connected with the subject. I will merely quote a sentence or two from the conclusions the Committee came to unanimously. They say that the extension of small holdings is a matter of national importance in the interests of the rural population, and also as an addition to the security of property generally. They believe that the desired object can be attained without serious risk or loss, and they go on to state that the working of a system of small holdings will be an encouragement to the rural population and will increase the attractions of rural life.

We propose to begin with the Relief of Distress Supplementary Vote, then to take the Railway Vote as second, and the other Irish Supplementary Votes in order, the Constabulary Vote coming, I think, third.

 SIR W. HARCOURT : I did not say I did not understand the principle of the Bill. I said I understood the principle of the Bill to be that it is desirable to increase the number of small holdings in this country, and to do it by the Local Authority, and I thoroughly approve of that principle.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Really, the right hon. Gentleman must not misrepresent me. I did not say that. On the contrary; I said I should support the Bill, and I did not wish it to be put aside.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I did not say that all or any of these measures were to be introduced before the Government Bill. I said these measures would be necessary to make it effective.
(4.33.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : The House has listened with interest to the speech the right hon. Gentleman has just delivered. I think the House is to be congratulated upon the position in which this measure now stands. For my part, I am very willing to let bygones be bygones. [ Ironical Ministerial cheers 705 706 707 "I am in favour of multiplying largely small properties in this country, but on three conditions. First of all, the land must be good; secondly, it must be cheap; and, thirdly, there must be some condition made with reference to building." 708 "It is a blessed word. I would not change it for the world. All previous efforts to deal with this matter have failed simply because there have been no compulsory powers at the back of them." 709 "The time has come when we must keep faith with these men. We must not pass a measure which would he inoperative, and any measure would be inoperative unless it contained compulsory powers." "If there is no compulsion, then the proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for West Birmingham will share the fate of the Act of George III. With the experience of that Act before us I ask, is it wise to embark on a measure of this kind? With compulsion you may do much, but is the Liberal Party prepared to adopt the principle of compulsion?" 710
*(1.52.)  SIR WALTER FOSTER  (Derby, Ilkeston) : I feel it a privilege to congratulate the hon. Member who has just sat down on his excellent speech, and on having given utterance to sentiments which most of us on this side of the House heartily approve. I am glad that Lincolnshire has sent a Member to add his protest to ours in favour of further legislation in this beneficentdirection. The President of the Board of Agriculture is also a Lincolnshire Member, and I hope he will rise to the position assumed by his colleague in reference to this question, and that when he brings in his Small Holdings Bill it will be framed on the broad and liberal lines suited to a question of national importance. This Debate is somewhat peculiar, because we are debating the

*(3.52.)  SIR E. BIRKBECK  (Norfolk, E.) : I wish to tender my most hearty congratulations to the hon. Member for the Bordesley Division that after so many years' working in regard to this subject he has at last obtained an opportunity of securing a full consideration of the important question of small holdings. In my opinion no Member of the House, or any man out of the House, has done so much to secure rural labourers small holdings and allotments as the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Saffron Walden has expressed a hope that this will not be a sham measure. Well, if the Bill is passed, or a Government Bill, and as much success attends them as has attended the Allotments Act, it will not be a sham measure. I served on the Select Committee, and was convinced most completely by what I heard there as to the importance of the creation of small holdings. But independently

*(5.45.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : In this proceeding I think we are creating a new precedent. This is the sixth year of the appointment of this Committee, and it has been sitting continuously for five years. I had the honour of a seat upon the Committee for four years, and, without boasting, I may say I was most regular in my attendance. But I happened to be the only Member from this side of the House who took the view that occupying tenants should have the right to purchase their freeholds, and I presume, in consequence of that, though I was anxious to be re-appointed last year I was excluded from the Committee. It is, I think, rather a novel proceeding in the re-appointment of a Committee when it lasts more than a year that changes should be made in the  personnel
 Sir JOHN MOWBRAY  reported from the Committee of Selection: That they had discharged the following Members from
(3.27.)  MR. B. T. REID  (Dumfries, &c.) : I wish to congratulate the hon. Member for Bordesley upon the success that his long and unremitting labours have attained. It is eight or nine years since my hon. Friend first brought this matter before the House, and for four or five years afterwards not only were his projects received with disfavour, but I think he himself encountered a good deal of opposition. On the present occasion he has the satisfaction of hearing from the other side of the House what, I have not the least doubt, is perfectly sincere appreciation of his Bill. I do not believe that it has been brought forward to serve any electioneering purpose. Hon. Gentlemen on both sides are beginning to feel the extreme importance of such measures in the interest of the country. Everybody agrees that the Bill ought to be read a second time, and I hope my hon. Friend will be able to pass it, with such Amendments as may be necessary, in the course of the Session; or that the Government will fulfil the pledge given at the beginning of the Session and pass some Small Holdings Bill equivalent to this. I could give instances of very successful efforts on the part of small holders in improving land which large occupiers would not look at. I could instance a place about two miles from Lochmaben where peat land has been converted into a smiling pasture. Departing from this subject, I attach more importance to these small plots of four or five acres than to 30 or 40 or 50 acres being taken up. Two hon. Members opposite seemed to be afraid that the Local Authority might be extravagant, or incur some loss by reason of the operations of this Bill. One hon. Member dwelt particularly on this. But if we cannot trust the Local Authorities for the purpose of carrying out reforms of this kind, whom can we trust? There is in truth no alternative. We must either do what was done by

(5.47.)  MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : It is, I believe, not certain that the Committee will take no other than Scotch business; but though that may be so, I may be allowed to say that Scotch Members will not object to the appointment of a Member from the Principality.
 SIR J. GORST  said: I am afraid that I must deprecate the putting of questions upon this subject, which involve details, without notice.
 MR. J. W. LOWTHER  (Cumberland, Penrith) : The Commissioners are informed that the old school-room of the Yelvertoft Educational Charity is regularly used for Sunday School, and also has for a considerable time been used as a parish reading-room, and for other purposes, including choir practice and vestry meetings. Permission to use the building has never been refused. As to the second paragraph—
 "Whether, although the Trustees are empowered to make payments for children resident in Yelvertoft so long as they attend a public elementary school, and satisfy the Trustees as to regularity and attendance, in January, 1891, the Trustees paid 30s. to a girl who did not attend a public elementary school between September 22 and November 10, 1890, and has not attended since December S, 1890 "— b
 MR. CHAINING : I had intended to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been called to the evidence at the inquest on George Wells, a platelayer of the North London Railway Company, who was killed at Highbury Station at 9 a.m. on 6th February, from which it appears that Wells came on duty at 9 a.m. on 5th February, worked till 5.30 p.m., resumed duty at 11 p.m. on the 5th, and would, if he had not been killed, have continued on duty till 5.30 p.m. on the 6th, and thus was on duty no less than 21½ hours, divided by an interval of only 5½ hours' rest, up to the time of his death, and would, if the accident had not occurred, have been on duty for 30 hours, with an interval of only 5½ hours; and whether the Board of Trade have made representations to the North London Railway Company, with a view to the prevention of such excessive hours of work? At the request of the right hon. Baronet I beg to postpone the question.
 MR. SPENCER BALFOUR : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he will take steps to give greater general publicity, by means of notices in Post Offices and in the Public Press, to the important arrangements recently concluded with the Railway Companies for the independent transmission of single letters by rail?
 MR. BROAUHURST  (Nottingham, W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he proposes to introduce and circulate the Employers' Liability Bill?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, for the convenience of Members, he will now indicate the date and duration of the Adjournment at Easter?
 THE CHAIRMAN : I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman that this would come more properly under the next Vote, which relates to the expenditure under the head of railways.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon Member has disqualified himself from discussing that subject because he has brought in a Bill dealing with it.
 An hon. MEMBER : And the Eight Hours Bill.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It clearly would not be in order to take that broad view, but I do not think the hon. Member has gone so far as that.
 MR. MAC NEILL : I will take no notice of the interruption except to say that when I come to the question of the Olphert estate on another Vote, I shall appeal to the hon. Gentleman, who was himself there when I was, to reply to the facts which I shall bring before the House. I am keeping strictly to the subject of Irish distress and its relief. Hon. Gentlemen will understand that distress arises from want of food; and if people burn other people's food and destroy it, there is a probability that food will be wanted. I brought this charge against Mr. Olphert publicly, and he could have charged me with libel if he had so chosen. I stated that the food and the crops of those people who had been evicted had been taken by Mr. Olphert's emergency men under the protection of the Royal Irish Constabulary——
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The railways will come on the next Vote.
 MR. CHAIRMAN : Order, order! That is not relevant.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
(9.50.)  MR. J. MORLEY : Now that the first Vote is passed, I wish to call the attention of the Committee to a matter
 832 "The entire sum for constructing these two lines from Galway to Clifden, and from Ballina to Killala, will amount to something like £314,000, without ever paying one single penny of dividend on it. There will be no debenture stock issued to cover it, no preference stock issued, no original stock. We shall not pay any interest on the loan. Every penny that we get will go into the pocket of the company, and I trust will largely add to our dividend." 833 "He understood that the company was about to invite tenders from a considerable number of selected firms for the final contract."
(9.57.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I do not profess to know the details of a great number of the items in this list of railways, but I know very well the details and the circumstances surrounding the

 MR. J. MORLEY : What is the estimate per mile now?
(10.34.)  MR. J. MORLEY : I am sure that we all agree that the right hon. Gentleman has devoted himself to these works with ability and in a spirit of self-denial, but I submit that if parlia-
 840
 MR. J. MORLEY : May I ask whether any sort of change has been made in the estimate as the result of this inquiry?
 MR. J. MORLEY : Was the Report of the Commissioners submitted to the Board of Works, and examined and passed by them?
 MR. J. MORLEY : At all events, it appears that the estimate fixed by the Railway Company was accepted by the Board of Works and the Treasury without alteration.
 MR. J. MORLEY : Now we understand. What has happened is this: Towards undertakings, which will cost £564,000, the Treasury are going to contribute £440,000. That sum of £440,000 is, in fact, given over to the

 MR. J. MORLEY : Under what penalties? I maintain we have no assurance against that line being given up, and I submit that the Government ought not to have given this sum of £440,000 in the way they have done.
 An hon. MEMBER : There are four.
(11.35.)  COLONEL NOLAN : The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy, who, in contradistinction to Irish Members, always makes himself so agreeable in the House, has invoked the memory of our lamented colleague, the late Mr. Biggar, in opposition to these proposals. But Mr. Biggar objected, as his successor in the representation of Cavan has, because they were narrow gauge railways projected. ["No, no!"] Hon. Members who contradict me do not recollect the speeches he made here. I know he also objected to the local guarantee, but now that principle is practically eliminated, or confined to only a few rich baronies. Let me recall to the memory of the Com-
 853 Hansard "Inasmuch, however, as the Government are giving the Galway people a better line than I supposed—that is to say, a heavy broad gauge line—I shall not persist in my opposition, but will leave the Government the responsibility of rejecting my advice."
 COLONEL NOLAN : No, no; not half that.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : Her Majesty's Government adhere to all the provisions of the Convention into which they have recently entered. In the event of the South African Republic joining the South African Customs Union, it would collect duties on goods imported by way of Natal at the Union rates. In that event, it would be entirely a question for the Natal Legislature whether it should continue to apply the present Natal Tariff to general goods merely passing through Natal for consumption in the Transvaal, or grant the exemptions in respect of them already enjoyed by spirits, wines, tea, and manufactured tobacco, or whether it should join the Union itself. The Customs Union Tariff is a Revenue, and not a Protective Tariff, and the question of "Protection"  versus
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The Sultan of Johore is an independent Ruler. The Secretary of State suggested that His Highness should, if he thought fit, confer with the Government of the Straits Settlements as to the line to be adopted for any railway constructed in his territory with a view to such line agreeing with the general system of railway communication established or contemplated in other States of the Malay Peninsula. The Crown Agents acted by the leave of, but not under instructions from, the Secretary of State in the conduct of the negotiations as to which they received instructions direct from the Sultan.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether the Dog-Muzzling Order now in force in Bournemouth and surrounding district will soon be dispensed with; and for what reason is the

 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland if he can state how much has been spent of the sum of £20,450 sanctioned for the erection of 288 labourers' dwellings in Cork, under the Labouring Classes' Lodgings and Dwellings Acts, and Housing of the

 DR. TANNER : I beg to postpone my question (to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if there is any open-air space in Clonmel, Galway, Kilmainham, or Tullamore Gaols, where prisoners can take the two hours' exercise as required by the Irish Prison Rules?) It appears in a wrong form upon the Paper.
 DR. TANNER : It is a fact.
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether any steps are proposed to be taken to provide a suitable pier at Castletownsend, County Cork; whether several resolutions from Public Bodies have been received advocating the building of such a structure; whether, in view of the fact that Castletownsend is a fishing port of considerable importance, and largely used by Irish, English, and Manx fishermen, and having regard to the distress and destitution now prevailing in the district in question, this reproductive public work will be proceeded with?
 DR. TANNER : Is the hon. Baronet aware that the old pier was built by the Treasury, that it is falling down, and also that this harbour is frequented by a large number of fishing boats during the fishing season? If representations are made to the Treasury will attention be paid to them, and the demands for providing harbour accommodation be, at any rate, inquired into?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland what is the daily cost of relief works in West Mayo and the Island of Achill; how much is spent daily in payment of men of the Royal Irish Constabulary and other officials in superintending such relief; and whether Catholic and Protestant clergyman, in each district where relief is necessary, are consulted upon the specific requirements and urgency of the poor people in want of help?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the right hon. Gentleman how many non-officials have been employed in the superintendence of relief works and the disbursement of relief in the County of Cork during the past month; and what was the total amount paid to the men in the police, and other officials and non-officials during the same period?
 DR. TANNER : What was paid to the police, and what to other officials?
 DR. TANNER : If I move for a Return will the right hon. Gentleman grant it?
(11.36.)  DR. TANNER : Remarks have been made upon the Irish Members praising the Government for what they propose to do. We are doing nothing of the kind. But, of course, we are ready to take from the Government all that we can get. The Government have so bungled Irish affairs as to bring about starvation, and now they must pay for their mismanagement. No gratitude is due from us; and from time to time we have pressed the claims we have on the Government in great emergencies like this. I have pressed the Government for three light railways within my own county; but though they were passed by the Grand Juries, I have only had success in one instance. As to this Galway and Clifden line, I think it will be more satisfactory to have the line worked by a large company, and they will probably manage it better than a small company could; and we have seen so much bungling in tramway administration, that perhaps this offers a better prospect. But, of course, we know that the reason why the Government have made this contract with the Great Western Company is not for the benefit of the people, but that they may be able to put a certain amount of money into the pockets of their political friends the landlords. But, even in this Galway and Clifden line, they have followed the worst course. They should have followed the line of the sea coast tapping
 854
 DR. TANNER : Order, order! I am here.
(9.45.)  DR. TANNER : With regard to accurate information, I would call the attention of the Government to a statement in the Return of 1890, referring to the district I represent. Mr. T. S. Porter says—
 "My Report on this Union not being completed, Mr. Doran will also report upon it. "I did not interview the clerks of the Union, believing that Mr. Porter hd done so.
 DR. TANNER : Yes; I am travelling a little beyond the Vote; but all I want to do is to draw attention to the fact—that money would be much better spent in constructing piers in Achill and other places than in making and repairing roads. It is important that the expenditure should be directed in the best manner, for the amount asked for is very small, the right hon. Gentleman telling us he has had regard to the interests of the British taxpayer. I am glad to hear that, though my experience in Committee of Supply is that the British taxpayer has often scant consideration, and millions are voted for dubious purposes upon very vain reasons. But if the right hon. Gentleman, instead of putting so much trust in the system he vaunts, and in which he is upheld by the hon. Member for South Tyrone, would avail himself of the local knowledge of the clergy, his efforts for the alleviation of acute distress would be much better directed. One point more in reference to piers. If the Reports of Inspectors are to be relied upon, it is upon the sea-bound congested districts that the failure of the potato crop has been most felt, and the distress among the people is most acute. I know from personal acquaintance with these districts, from fishing and yachting visits in times long past, as well as in more recent visits, the cry of the people is for
 828
 DR. TANNER : The principal.
 DR. TANNER : Then, Sir, I will leave that subject. There is one district in which nothing at all has been done. I allude to the district of Donoughwon, and I venture to say if anyone would take the trouble to drive through it he would become convinced of the terrible poverty of the people. I have called attention to their condition time after time without effect; but I hope that even now something will be done on their behalf. I am not often able to praise the Chief Secretary, but I am bound to say that in the Castle Hayden district a considerable amount of good has been done. Still the wages paid are, in the case of large families, only just enough to stave off starvation, and I think they might reasonably be increased. I am afraid, however, that the right hon. Gentleman has trusted too much to the Reports of his Inspectors as to the condition of the various districts in Ireland. I followed one of the right hon. Gentleman's Inspectors through certain parts of the country, and found that in many places where the Inspector reported the potato crops to be fairly good the greater part of the potatoes were not fit for human food, and I was informed by medical experts that if the people were to consume such food they would probably become victims to fever. I would suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that, instead of trusting exclusively to the reports of his Inspectors upon the state of the various districts of the country, he should apply for information on the subject to the clergy and to the medical men who reside in them. With regard to the classes of officers by whom the works are
 822
(9.18.)  DR. TANNER : There are several points which have not been touched upon in the course of this Debate, and there are several questions that deserve specific answers. To what extent has the right hon. Gentleman availed himself of the local knowledge of the priests in the distressed districts in Ireland? I have already elaborated this point, but no answer has been vouchsafed. Are the police entrusted with the administration of the whole funds? My hon. Friend the Member for South Longford (Mr. Fitzgerald) certainly did very well in hammering this point home, but I put the question specifically. Are the police entrusted with the administration of the whole funds; and, further, is it true that the famine-stricken condition of the people is being made the excuse for paying starvation wages? By the statement of the Chief Secretary we learned that the people employed on relief works are getting, in some cases, shelter and fuel for cooking and 7s. a week; but, said the right hon. Gentleman, in certain instances it is in the power of the administration to give them a stone of meal, which he showed is worth 11d. a day, which amounts therefore to 5s. 6d. a week. Therefore, it would seem that advantage is taken of the condition of the people to pay starvation wages. To speak plainly, is it an alternative open to the police if a man has strong political views opposed to the Executive—if he is, say, a campaign tenant—is it in the option of the police to decree that that man is to receive a stone of meal in lieu of 7s. a week and shelter? Another point arises in connection with local relief works—are alien artisans employed? If reports are accurate, this has been the case. Aliens have been employed to the exclusion of poor and respectable men in the small towns of the West of Ireland. This is not fair, and I should like to know under what circumstance it is allowed. Something we have heard of what is being done on Tory Island, and we should naturally suppose the name would evoke the sympathy of a Conservative Government. We have long been anxious to
 827
 DR. TANNER : I have been led into the mistake by reason of the Chief Secretary having alluded to them. At the present moment we have only to deal with relief works. In connection with these I find that only one member of a family is employed at 12s. a week—a sum which has to support some seven or eight people. In many cases that is not enough. He has alluded to fraudulent starvation cases; but I regret that he did not furnish us with the names of the clergymen who had been imposed upon. We are, however, accustomed to the word "anonymous" in many of the statements of the right hon. Gentleman. He has frequently given us statistics of boycotting, but has never favoured us with the names of those who had been boycotted. I hope, before the Debate closes, he will be able to furnish the names of the rev. gentlemen who have been imposed upon. Attention has been called to the planting which has taken place at Lough Boyle. Last year I introduced a small Bill dealing with planting in Ireland. I took up the subject believing that if tree planting were properly carried out in Ireland, many good results would arise. Places now sterile would thus become productive; while employment would be given to a large amount of labour. I was pleased to hear the right hon. Gentleman admit that the English system of forestry was inferior to that which is pursued on the Continent, particularly in Germany and France. A gentleman in Gal way, a Mr. M'Dermott, whose acquaintance, I believe, the right hon. Gentleman has made, has paid great attention to this subject, and notably to the Forestry of the West of Ireland; and I think if the right hon. Gentleman would read his pamphlets, and follow the advice he has tendered to the Royal Society at Dublin, much good: would result. The late Sir G. Coulthurst, who was a Member of this House, planted Ballyvourney and Rathcoole, I believe, with success; and if the Chief Secretary could but see his way to planting many other districts which it is impossible to make productive other-

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : With the exception of the hon. and gallant Member for Galway, there is not any one present, as far as I know, who represents any county which is interested in these lines, and the opinion of the hon. and gallant Member for Galway is that the
 842 843
(10.43.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I think that the right hon. Gentleman has forgotten the Debate we had upon this question of light railways in 1889. The right hon. Gentleman seems to think that it is a new policy to get the great Railway Companies to work one of these lines; not only is it not a new invention, but it is part of the policy of the Act of 1889, and it is the point on which, for my own part, I think the policy of the Government is incomparably in advance of anything which has been done by their predecessors. I observe that there is not a single Irish Member in the House, except the hon. and gallant Member for Galway.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Both the lines named are light lines.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I said nothing of the kind. What I said was, it would not be wise to have a narrow gauge line running into an ordinary line.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Not at all. Hon. Gentlemen opposite may be interested to know that the police reported some heartrending cases.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : And I say the hon. Member is mistaken.
(9.32.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The next Vote is one on which I expect some discussion, and I believe the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Newcastle intends to raise an important point with regard to it. Perhaps, therefore, the sooner we proceed to that Vote the better. The hon. Member opposite has put three questions to me which I think can be answered in three sentences. It does not rest with the police to determine who shall be employed on the works; the rate of wages is not determined by the police; and, with regard to the priests, I am desirous of obtaining all the information I can of the various localities through the priests, or any other trustworthy source. The other questions raised hardly call for reply. The hon. Member for Donegal spent a good deal of time in discussing details, and I will not follow him in that, but he said that the Chief Secretary awoke to the fact that something ought to have been done in November last. In that the hon. Member is greatly mistaken. It was in July last that I asked the House to pass the Light Railways Bill against the opposition of hon. Members below the Gangway opposite. It was in August last that I had many important interviews with Inspectors of the Local Government Board on the subject of the condition of the potatoes, and it was in September that I made arrange-
 829
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : No, their statements were simply supplementary.
(4.32.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : Mr. Courtney, it will be in the recollection of the Committee that in the early days of last December I asked the Committee of Supply to vote a relatively nominal sum—£5,000—towards the relief of distress in Ireland. The sum I ask the Committee to vote to-day is a much larger one, and hon. Members have, no doubt, a right to ask what account I can give of the plan we are actually carrying out, and which I briefly sketched on a previous occasion. Our experience, of course, is not yet complete. In England, as the spring-approaches, the strain of distress either on the Poor Law administration or on private charity sensibly diminishes; but in Ireland, when the distress arises from the failure of the potato, the crisis is not in the winter months, but it goes on steadily increasing in intensity, until it is either relieved by the annual migration of the able-bodied men to England or Scotland, or by digging for the next year's potatoes in those parts of the country where migration is not practised. Therefore, it comes about that the account I shall have to give to-day of what we have done in the way of relieving distress does not include a survey of the whole of the transactions in which this House has taken part in this matter. All I intend now to do is to give the results of our efforts and experience up to the most recent available date. Now, the Vote on which we are actually engaged is a Vote for the Relief of Distress, to be followed immediately by a Vote on Railways; but I think it will be convenient to the Committee if, on the first of the Votes, I touch not, indeed, on the railway policy of the Government—not upon those matters in which I know the right hon. Member for Newcastle is interested, but on certain

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : A great many items are involved. The £21,000 merely refers to the actual wages on the relief works.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Yes.

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Yes.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The rotten potatoes were not distributed.
 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : As the Under Secretary for India is not in his place at this moment, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs will be able to say what remissions, if any, were made by the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Province of Oudh to the State tenants in 1887–8, when the average price of food was more than one-third higher than the average of the six preceding years; and whether he can state how far there is any connection between the high prices ruling in 1887–8 and the fact that the recorded death rate in India in that year was the highest known?
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : My attention had not previously been called to the statements which have been published by Dr. Rentoul. The births of still-born children are not registered by the Registrars of Births and Deaths, and consequently no Returns of these births are made to the Registrar General. I am, therefore, not in a position to give a Return of the number of infants interred as still-born in 1890, nor to state what proportion of these infants were born respectively in and out of wedlock.

 MR. RITCHIE : I have received a copy of the entry in the register of deaths in the case of the child referred to. The cause of death, as certified by the medical man, was vaccinia and pyæmia. The case has been brought under the attention of the Royal Commission on Vaccination, and it is, I understand, to be investigated by one of the medical men employed by the Commission for such inquiries.

 MR. MADDEN : The total amount sanctioned for labourers' dwellings in the City of Cork is £20,291 9s. 5d., in addition to a sum of £1,000 sanctioned previously. The number of houses originally proposed to be erected was 298. Building sites have, it appears, been acquired, but as it is proposed by the Sanitary Authority to reduce the number of houses to 254, they have been obliged to submit an amended scheme to the Board of Works. Upon this scheme being approved, the Sanitary Authority intends to proceed at once with the erection of the houses, which can be completed within a few months from the date of approval.
 MR. MADDEN : I do not know that there would be any objection, except the objection to the multiplication of Tin-necessary Returns.
 MR. MADDEN : I must ask the hon. Member to postpone this question.
 MR. MADDEN : The question of the hon. Member related to the total amount. If he wishes to know how that amount was divided he must put another question.
 MR. MADDEN : There are no non-officials employed in the superintendence of the relief works or the disbursement of wages. Sixty-one officials, including the County Surveyor, are employed in this work. The cost of the various officials carrying on the work up to the 28th February was £253 18s. 6d.
 MR. MADDEN : The average daily cost in wages to persons employed on labour at relief works in the district mentioned is £134 9s. 10d. In addition to this, the amount spent daily in payment of Constabulary timekeepers and Royal Engineer supervisors is £14 4s., and the county surveyor gets a sum of £2 2s. for any day he may be employed. Any recommendations from clergymen are fully and carefully considered. In many instances their suggestions have been adopted.
 MR. MADDEN : I must ask the hon. Gentleman to postpone the question.
 MR. MADDEN : Two men were wounded by shots fired on the occasion mentioned. According to the latest information both men are progrsssing favourably. A man has been arrested on the charge of firing a revolver, and is detained in custody.
 MR. MADDEN : The Constabulary authorities report that on the occasion referred to, the action and language of

 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University : The insurance branch of the Constabulary Force Fund is in process of being wound up by gradual extinction under the Act of 1883, which prohibits members joining the Force after that date from subscribing to the Fund. There is, however, no intention to make a general distribution of the Fund; but each claim against it will, as heretofore, be paid upon maturing. There is no known instance of an unmarried man now on pension continuing to subscribe to the fund, nor could such a subscriber derive any benefit from doing so by the rules governing the fund. Rewards of merit are not paid from the insurance branch of the fund, which is paid from the subscriptions of contributing members, but from the reward branch, the income of which is derived from portions of fines awarded to the police by Magistrates, or under the Licensing Acts. Eight men, appointed since the Act of 1883, have received rewards from the reward branch, amounting in all to a total of £18.
 MR. MADDEN : The Constabulary authorities report that the constable had not received any orders in the matter. It was explained at the time of the occurrence that the constable's action was the result of the hostile demeanour of the crowd. The reply to the second paragraph of the question is in the negative.
 MR. MADDEN : Yes, Sir; the matter was reported as a breach of discipline, and came before the Inspector General who admonished the constable and placed an unfavourable mark against his name.
 MR. MADDEN : The facts are as stated by my hon. Friend in the first paragraph of the question. National League meetings have been held on the Parade Ground where Mr. Hallowes held the open-air services. The Constabulary Authorities report that the arrests were quietly effected and were not made until the train was actually due; but the train was half an hour late in reaching Arklow.
 MR. BOULNOIS  (Marylebone, E.) : I desire, on behalf of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, to say that this Bill is only one to raise additional capital for the purpose of constructing storage reservoirs and filter beds. If it is thought necessary by my right hon. Friend the President of the Local Government Board to send the Bill to the Hybrid Committee which is to sit on the general question of the Water Supply of the Metropolis, and not, as in an ordinary case, to a Select Committee, the company will offer no opposition.
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether, in the year 1889, an intimation was given by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Johore Government that the Sultan should, if possible, arrange with the Singapore Government for the construction of a railway in the territory of Johore; and whether any railway concession was negotiated by the Crown Agents for the Colonies, acting under the direction of the Secretary of State, in substitution for a concession granted by the Sultan in April, 1888, to certain British subjects?
*(11.24.)  MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : On this question Members who come from Ireland cannot be expected to take the same line as some of the English Members who have spoken. I was one of those Irish Members who at the end of last Session kept the House till very early one morning in oppos-

 MR. DE COBAIN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if his attention has been drawn to the outrage alleged to be perpetrated by the Belfast section of the meeting of the supporters of the hon. Member for Cork (Mr. Parnell) at Newry on his return journey, in the discharge of two shots out of the railway carriage by which they travelled, inflicting injury on two or more persons in the vicinity of the train; whether he has heard as to whether the injuries are likely to prove fatal, and if he can state to what Political Party the injured persons belong; and whether the Constabulary have obtained any trace of the perpetrators of the outrage?
 MR. DE COBAIN  (Belfast, E.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware that out of four charges brought against the Rev. R. C. Hallowes, Rector of Arklow, and his curate, the Rev. J. W. Harrison, of obstruction, alleged to have been caused by the holding of religious services, three have failed for want of evidence, and that in the fourth case the rev. gentlemen were convicted by the Magistrates; is he aware that the ground occupied by Mr. Hallowes and Mr. Harrison has frequently been used for Land League and National League meetings; under what law or regulation did Divisional Commissioner Cameron act in ordering the arrest of Messrs. Hallowes and Harrison, when on their knees praying with their congregation, and 30 minutes before the arrival of the train which was to convey them to Wexford Gaol; and whether he will cause inquiry to be made into the circumstance of the case?
 MR. DE COBAIN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that Father Dumphy, the parish priest of Arklow, had on Sunday the 1st of March broken through the ranks of the Constabulary in the streets of Arklow, taken hold of District Inspector Tottenham, and assaulted him, calling at the same time on the mob to follow him; and what course the Government intend to pursue in relation to this case?
 MR. EDWARD HARRINGTON  (Kerry, W.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether it is the intention of the Inspector General and the Royal Irish Constabulary Authorities to wind up the Constabulary Force Fund, and whether unmarried men who joined the Force before 1883, and who are now on pension, continue to subscribe to the Fund with no other prospect of return than that of said Fund being wound up and apportioned to subscribers; and whether rewards of merit have been taken from this Fund and distributed to officers and men who may have joined the Force since 1883, or who, in any case, have not been subscribers to the Fund?
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The time referred to is not allowed in the case of a regimental camp; but it is allowed in another form for a brigade camp. The distinction was deliberately made to encourage the formation of brigade camps, which are of much more value for purposes of military training than regimental camps.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : Stocktaking is continuously carried out in the Ordnance Factories, so that agreement between the stock and the ledger accounts is arrived at in sections. It would interfere too greatly with current work and would require too large a staff to take the whole stock at any one period.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : In answer to these questions, I have to say that the information is being prepared and will be laid upon the Table.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : Yes, Sir; I think so.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : In 1890 the steel forgings produced in the ordnance factories were 22½ per cent. of the whole supply.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : I can only say at present that the question is under consideration whether any portion of this money can be devoted to the purpose mentioned by the hon. Member.
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether his attention has been called to the case of Mr. Punshon of 37, Darwin Street, Old Kent Road, S.E., whose infant child is medically certified to have died on 26th February from blood poisoning, from vaccination performed by a public vaccinator; and whether he has directed an inquiry to be made into this case; if so, with what result; if not, whether it is his intention to direct that such inquiry be held by his Department?

 MR. GOSCHEN : The Government of Newfoundland have been informed that under certain circumstances and conditions Her Majesty's Government would be prepared to meet their wish that an Imperial guarantee should be given on a loan raised for railway and analogous purposes; but I am unable to make any statement as to terms. The matter has not reached any definite shape.
 MR. ATKINSON : I had intended to ask the President of the Board of Trade if he will let the Committee on the Incidence of Light Dues meet, without any longer seeking to bind the ship-owning Members to give up their conviction that Light Dues should fall on the Consolidated Fund, in accordance with the recommendation of Select Committees of this House? but at the request of the right hon. Gentleman I will postpone the question until Monday.
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if it is true that Her Majesty's Government will guarantee a Newfoundland Government Loan of £2,000,000, or any other amount; and, if so, at what rate, and on what terms?
 MR. BROADHURST  (Nottingham, W.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether Her Majesty's Government will instruct the Government of India, in framing the amended India Factory Act, to accord the same protection to the working classes of India that has been granted by the English Factory and Workshop Act to the working classes of this country?
 MR. CHAPLIN : I cannot answer that question without notice; but I may say that the great majority of cases were inquired into by a member of the Veterinary College.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : I am afraid that I cannot dispense with the Muzzling Order at present at Bournemouth. It is kept in force during the winter in what the hon. Member describes, very accurately I have no doubt, as "that very healthy place," because two cases have occurred there since the winter commenced, one of them having occurred so lately as the end of January or the beginning of last month. In reply to a further question as to what proof there was of disease—I am unable to answer that question in these two particular cases without notice. Usually, I believe, the carcases of these animals undergo examination, and some of them are sent to London—I believe to the Royal Veterinary College for the purpose.
 MR. COBB : Will the Inflammable Liquids Bill be taken before Easter?
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the hon. Member for Penrith (Mr. J. W. Lowther), as a Charity Commissioner, whether he is aware that, although under a scheme of the 9th February, 1883, for regulating the Yelvertoft Educational Charity, as varied by a scheme of the 21st February, 1890, the Trustees may let the building formerly used as a school, and are directed to appropriate the same, if not let, for the promotion of the education, instruction, or recreation of the poorer inhabit-ants' of Yelvertoft, this building has not been let and is not appropriated as directed, but is only used once a week for the practice of the church choir; whether he is aware that, although by the scheme the Trustees are empowered to make payments for children resident in Yelvertoft so long as they attend a public elementary school and satisfy the Trustees as to regularity in attendance, in January, 1891, the Trustees paid 30s.

 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will inquire from the Coroner for Westminster and state if, in the case of the late Duke of Bedford, the deceased was described in the inquisition by the same names as in the certificate of the finding of the jury, under the 16th section of the Registration Act of 1874; whether it is usual for the jurors to sign, the inquisition in blank, or only partly filled up, and to fill it up after the jury have signed it; and if, in this case, the inquisition was filled up before signing by the jury?
 MR. COBB : Is the hon. Baronet aware that several publicans have been annoyed by the proceedings which officials have taken; and that, although shopkeepers are allowed to have licences for the sale of stamps on application, publicans are always refused?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he will give such instructions as will prevent the enforcement of penalties against publicans and tradesmen who oblige their customers by selling them postage stamps after post offices are closed?
 MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether his attention has been called to the Return of Sittings of County Courts recently presented to the House, from which it appears that 11 of the County Court Judges held less than 120 sittings during the year 1889; and whether any steps will be taken to put in force the 10th and 13th sections of "The County Court Act, 1888," so as to secure more frequent sittings of the Courts for the benefit of the suitors, and to provide for a redistribution of judicial work among the Judges?
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : Will the Orders, referred to be laid on the Table?
 MR. HOBHOUSE : A doubt has arisen in the country owing to the fact that in the Act of 1889 there are separate definitions of technical and manual instruction, whereas in the Act of last year there is only the expression "technical education," without any definition.
 MR. HOBHOUSE  (Somerset, E.) : I beg to move after Clause 1, the insertion of the following new clause—
 (Construction of 53 and 54 Vic. c. 60, s. 1.) "The expression 'technical education' in Section 1 of The Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act, 1890,' shall be deemed to include both technical and manual instruction within the meaning of the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891." 859
 MR. HOBHOUSE : I also move that at the end of Clause 2 the following words be inserted:—
 "And shall be construed as one with the Technical Instruction Act, 1889."
 MR. HOWORTH  (Salford, S.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in view of the continual counts which have taken place on Private-Members' nights recently, and of the general anxiety that the Session should not be prolonged beyond July, Her Majesty's Government will favourably consider the widespread wish that the nights thus wasted should be appropriated to Government business?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether any payments have been made within the past 12 months for the hire of steamers between Great Britain and the Continent for the conveyance of distinguished personages; and, if so, under what Vote of Supply have they been included?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Have any bills been incurred for the conveyance of distinguished persons to and from the Continent? These sums used to appear on the Estimates; and, as the hon. Baronet says that no payments have been made in this respect with voted money, I wish to know from what sources the payments have been defrayed?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Court fees fixed in 1874, in respect to Probates and Letters of Administration, by Sir James Hannen, with the concurrence of the then Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice, under the provisions of an Act of Parliament, and approved of by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, have been altered by the Senior Registrar so that the said fees are now paid on net instead of on gross amount; and whether this alteration involves a loss to the Revenue?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether, in regard to the stock in the Ordnance Factory, referred to by Sir Charles Ryan in the revised Report on Public Accounts, complete stocktaking is effected punctually; and, if so, at what periods?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Postmaster General when the revised scheme, affecting the superior officers of the post offices in the towns mentioned in a question put to the right hon. Gentleman by the late Mr. Bradlaugh, will come into force; and whether it is intended to make its action retrospective?
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he can state what was decided by the Committee on Naval Uniforms, and what action it is intended to be taken on them?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether any allowance is given to Commanders of Her Majesty's ships whenever personages, not in the Civil or Military Service of Her Majesty, are conveyed on such ships; whether any such personages have been conveyed on Her Majesty's ships during the last 12 months; whether, if any such personages have been conveyed, he will lay upon the Table of the House a Return stating the names of such personages, the occasions on which they have been conveyed, and the amounts paid; and whether he will say, if such personages have been conveyed, under what Vote of Supply, and under what sub-head, the amounts thus paid have been included?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : On the railroads alone?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : They receive 10s. to 13s. a week each, so that you are only spending about £40,000 a month out of this £440,000 grant upon the working classes. The rest of the money will go into the pockets of the shareholders, who belong to the classes and not to the masses.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : And the right hon. Gentleman admits that the narrow gauge system is working satisfactorily in Donegal. I do not see why you want these expensive lines. The people have not enough to eat, so they are not likely to have any produce to send by train; and they have no money, so they cannot buy things which would have to be brought to them by train. The whole thing is a farce and an absurdity. I have the warmest sympathy with the Irish, and am perfectly ready to give them Home Rule to any extent. One reason for this is that if the Irish do not soon get Home Rule the English people will be left without a shirt to their backs, all their money having been voted in Irish subsidies. It seems to me these Government schemes are only put forward in order to try to induce the Irish to give up their demand for Home Rule. Hon. Gentlemen opposite who come strolling in after dinner intent on voting the money may be impatient, but we intend to have an explanation about every shilling asked for; we intend to protest against this expenditure, and in many cases to vote against it. My right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle complained, in the second place, that the Government had entered into these contracts recklessly. I agree with him. In these arrangements which the Treasury have made the shareholders of the great Irish Railway Companies and not the particular districts are benefited. This is another instance of the Government legislating at the expense of the masses for the benefit of the classes. One day it is the publican, the next the clergy, then the landlord, and now the railway shareholder who are to be benefited at the expense of the English taxpayers. I think that what has transpired to-day thoroughly justified our action in spending a whole night before Christmas in opposing these Bills. The scheme is a thoroughly bad one, and it is perfect hypocrisy to say that it is to give immediate relief to the poor
 845
 MR. LABOUCHERE : And yet the right hon. Gentleman said it was preposterous to make a light railway.
(10.50.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : The first contention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle was that railways which are called in this scheme light railways are not accurately described. I think we have just cause of complaint on that ground. I might have had no desire to complain of the making of light railways, and so have stayed away from this House to-night. Yet now we are being asked to vote money for works not correctly described. The Chief Secretary, in answer to my right hon. Friend, says the policy of the Government in having heavy lines is a wise one. But surely light railways would have suited just as well, and have been less expensive. Take the County of Donegal, the Stranorlar or Glenties line; or take the Killybegs line. I am told that at Killybegs there are about 200 people. Surely their requirements would have been amply met with a light line.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I propose to introduce the Bill as soon as the progress of Public Business is such as to enable me to proceed with it effectually.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Coroner that the answer to the first paragraph is in the affirmative. It is usual for the jury to sign the inquisition partly filled up, the particulars having been previously endorsed. This practice was not departed from on this occasion.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : Yes, Sir; the Memorandum in question will contain, as far as possible, the Memorials referred to.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, Sir; I have received a Report from the Justices as to these cases, and also a copy of the evidence. Itdepends upon the circumstances of each case whether the offence can be adequately punished by the infliction of a fine. In previous cases in the City of Norwich the Magistrates had imposed fines; but finding that these sentences had not had a deterrent effect they were of opinion that a sentence of imprisonment was necessary for the protection of individuals and for the general peace of the city. The sentence in the case of Wright has already all but expired, and I should not be justified in advising any interference with the sentence on Shingles, whose offence was clearly proved.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : The hon. Member is not correct in stating that the duties in the one case which he mentions are similar to the duties in the other. There is much difference between them in importance and responsibility, and hence the difference in pay. I have, with the sanction of the Treasury, just revised the entire office at Newcastle, and I am not prepared to alter the decision. I may add that the "clerks" on the telegraph side and on the postal side at Newcastle get precisely the same salaries, namely, £140, by £6, to£170.
 *MR. RAIKES : My answer to the first part of the hon. Member's question is in the negative. As regards the second part of the question, I hope to reduce the hours of work of the officers referred to soon after Easter.
 *MR. RAIKES : This matter is being closely examined by the Treasury, and that Department is dealing with the various cases in batches and proceeding with the work, which is very laborious, as it comes before it. The decision on the point referred to in the last paragraph of the hon. Gentleman's question, as indeed on all those involved, rests with the Treasury.
 *MR. RAIKES : The remuneration for duties performed on Sunday at Liverpool and other provincial offices by Post Office servants of the class referred to, is at present given in their ordinary weekly wages. The question whether extra remuneration shall be granted for these duties is now under consideration.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am glad to have anticipated the suggestion of the hon. Member, for a notice relating to the arrangements referred to is now being-exhibited at every Post Office, and copies of it have been furnished to the Press, both metropolitan and provincial.
 MR. H. GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : Will the Tithe Bill be taken before the Adjournment?

 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : Will the Civil Service Estimates be taken this side of Easter?
 *MR. CRAIG : I have no hesitation in giving an emphatic contradiction to that statement. I have practical experience in these matters. The normal gauge of English railways is 4 feet 8½ inches, and beyond that the line is known as a broad railway. The right hon. Gentleman has no practical acquaintance with these matters, and has been led into the use of misleading terms. A light railway means, light rails and narrow gauge, light work and a light engine to run upon it. If the right hon. Gentleman will refer to the Act of 1889 he will find that a light railway is defined as including a tramway, did the right hon. Gentleman ever hear of a tramway 5 feet 3 inches? The term tramway was included, so that part of the money might be used for carrying out the object of the Tramways Act of 1883. The whole proceedings in Committee was misleading in the highest degree, and I say they were intended to mislead [ Interruptions Cries of Interruptions
*(11.49).  MR. CRAIG  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : As one who spent a great deal of time on the Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce in 1889, when the Bill known as the Light Railway Bill was sent to it; as one of those who remembers how a measure of 21 pages was reduced, by a series of very clever tactics and artifices, to three or four pages; as one of those also who remembers the significance attached to the words light railways in those days, I confess I am surprised that those who sit on the Treasury Bench should tell us that in-

(8.20.)  DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : We wished very much at the time these grants were first submitted to Parliament that we had been able to dispense with them, but still relief was necessary, and I cannot help saying after the statement we have listened to to-night that as far as the limited funds permitted, the right hon. Gentleman has certainly endeavoured to carry out the work satisfactorily. The only thing I regret is that Parliament could not see its way to grant more money. I am one of those who think that any money voted by this House for the relief of the poor in Ireland is not given in the way of charity, but is simply a restitution of money which Ireland has for many generations been improperly deprived of. The main reason why I regret that the House has not seen its way to vote more money for these relief works is, that although much of it finds its way into the pockets of contractors and others who are not in need of it, a considerable amount does reach the very poor. I give the right hon. Gentleman full credit for having selected those districts which stood most in need of relief, but still the amount which the Committee are asked to vote to-night is but as a drop in the ocean; and a great many districts remain—among them some in the county which I have the honour to represent—in need of this help. Much might be done in the towns by getting rid of the filthy hovels in the back streets and substituting for them houses which would be a credit instead of a disgrace to a civilised people. The right hon. Gentleman, in speaking of the difficulties with which he had to contend, stated to the House—not, I believe, for the purpose of prejudicing the case of these poor people who are often very much in need of work—instanced cases in which men had applied for work while they were drunk. Of course, we know that unfortunately this disease of drunkenness is very prevalent among the lower classes of the Irish people, but I would submit, in extenuation, that it may in part be attributed to the want of food, for they sometimes have to go without dinner and supper three or four days in succession; and then a pint of bad porter

(8.14.)  MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I am growing sick of this system of relief works, by reason of the way in which they are managed, for jobbery and demoralisation prevail all around. We must, however, hope for better things by and bye. The congratulations showered by the hon. Member for South Tyrone on the system of the Chief Secretary are, I think, premature. A few days ago I called attention to cases of distress in the County of Roscommon, and the Chief Secretary said he was inquiring into them, but he has as yet done nothing. I now wish to call attention to the dire distress prevailing in Gweedore. Not a single seed potato has been sent there, neither has any relief works been started. This is owing to the apathy of the Guardians, an apathy to be accounted for by the fact that the Chairman of the Poor Law Board is Mr. Olphert. I am afraid that it is his hardness of heart which has prevented the Chief Secretary from relieving the distress there. Finally, I should like to say, I do not know anything more cruel than to make the police the instruments for distributing the relief seeing how they are hated in Ireland, and I feel confident that many people would sooner starve than accept

 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : Has any action been taken in regard to this man, who appears to have acted without warrant?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by whose orders did a police constable, named Connell, stationed at Schull, County Cork, load his rifle in the presence of a large number of people returning from a meeting which was addressed by Mr. William O'Brien, M.P.; and was such action warranted by the regulations of the Royal Irish Constabulary?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the condition of a vast proportion of the population of the Gweedore district of Dunfanaghy Union; whether any part of Ireland can show a worse condition than is to be found in the Meenacladdy, Bloodyforeland, and Brinlack portions of this district; what measures he proposes for the relief of this misery; whether his attention has been called to the consequences that must result next year owing to the fact that no seed potatoes have been provided for the Gweedore district, and whether he purposes making provision to prevent the famine that must ensue next year if seed be not promptly provided now; and whether it is by any fault of the Poor Law Guardians of the district that no seed has been provided; and, if so, whether he can compel this Board of Guardians to perform their duty in this crisis, or whether he will take steps to save the people from the consequences of their neglect?
 MR. PICTON : Are not some of these schools maintained by the Education Department, and could not the Department exercise power in regard to them?

*(6.25.)  SIR J. COLOMB  (Tower Hamlets, Bow, &c.) : I would point out to the hon. Gentleman (Mr. T. Pry) if the seed potatoes distributed are found
 802 803
 *SIR J. COLOMB : I am exactly in accord with the right hon. Gentleman. I am quite opposed to the Government undertaking such gigantic operations at all, but I must also point out that the law as it is, is quite sufficient for the full development of the policy the right hon. Gentleman advocates. Take the case of a small tenant in any county in Ireland. Suppose I am a tenant, and want to reclaim a piece of land. I post a letter without a stamp to the Board of Works in Dublin saying what I want, the Board sends an Inspector and the Inspector draws the plans, everything is done for me. I am not even required to pay for his expenses, or his plans, or for postage. The Government give me professional advice, and advance the money on easy terms, spreading repayment over a large number of years, and I get the full benefit of the reclamation, which becomes my absolute private property. Well, I do not see that legislation can go any further, so that what the right hon. Gentleman says, in effect, amounts to this—that the law as regards reclamation is perfectly sufficient, and that there is nothing further to be done. But I think if the right hon. Gentleman really knew Ireland, and had travelled through Ireland, he would feel amazed and distressed at the amount of land there is in Ireland which is capable of being made infinitely more productive by the expenditure of very little capital and labour upon it in view of the fact that all the land is in the occupation of tenants, and that the law as it at present stands does not produce the result that was hoped for as regards reclamation of land, there is no alternative; you are either to say the land is not to be reclaimed, but to remain as it is, or you must propose some new plan. For my part I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it is not work for the Government; but I certainly think it is the business of the Government to assist in the operation of reclamation—not through the occupying tenant, but by some process of enabling capitalists and landlords to acquire from tenants neglected land for purposes of reclamation, making that land more profitable in the future. That, I believe, is the true policy; but you are immediately face to face with the difficulty, that the Land Acts of the last few years have
 805
*(11.0.)  SIR J. COLOMB : The hon. Member for Northampton has talked about the farce and absurdity of the position taken up by the Government in this matter, but he has himself illustrated the farce and absurdity of a Member discussing a question connected with districts the very names of which he cannot pronounce, and as to which he openly professes utter ignorance. Was it wise and right for the Government to make these arrangements with the great companies or was it not? If I give a short account of one of the railways of which I have intimate knowledge, it will sufficiently explain why I say the Government was absolutely right, in the interest of the district and of Ireland generally, to take the course they did. I speak of the Headfort and Kenmare Railway. For years the district has been trying to get a railway; and as to the question of a light or heavy railway the hon. Member for Northampton cannot have taken the trouble to look at the speech the Chief Secretary made when he introduced the Light Railway Bill. In that speech the right hon. Gentleman distinctly stated that the Bill covered both a 5ft. 3in. gauge and a narrow gauge, and that he proposed to leave it to the discretion of the districts whether they should adopt the 5ft. 3in. or the narrow gauge. The position in regard to the Headfort and Kenmare line was this: The Government gave as a free gift £50,000, and the country guaranteed £60,000 on the security of the county cess; but the condition was most properly imposed that the railway should be worked. It could only be worked by the Great Southern and Western Railway, because there was no fund out of which any other body could

 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, with the Memorandum of data and reasons for the Inflammable Liquids Bill, he will give the Memorials from Public Authorities referred to by him on Monday, 9th March?
 *SIR J. POPE HENNESSY : I may perhaps be allowed to say that the House many years ago dealt with the law, and actually repealed it, though the Bill was thrown out in another place. The Irish Members say that the area contemplated by the right hon. Gentleman is too small, that the distress in the South and West of Ireland is widespread, and we appeal to the officers of the right hon. Gentleman in support of our contention. The right hon. Gentleman deserves credit for much that he did in connection with Irish distress—he himself visited that particular part of Ireland to which he has especially called attention to-night—but the House will observe the very fact that the right hon. Gentleman's tour was not extended to the more southern parts of Ireland may account for the fact, that in the proposal put before us to-night he has omitted those districts to which my hon. and gallant Friend called attention. But the whole question of the relief of Irish distress depends upon far higher considerations than those which have been stated by the Chief Secretary. Take that experiment which he is now about to begin. He deserves credit for being the first Chief Secretary to try the experiment of afforestation even upon a very minute scale; but it is impossible not to see that the difficulties to which he has just referred are difficulties that can only be encountered by an Executive in Dublin and a Parliament in Dublin. It is impossible for this House, with the large amount of business before it, adequately to deal with the remedies for the state of things in Ireland; and, there-

*(11.15.)  SIR J. POPE HENNESSY : I think the greatest credit is due to the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury for the businesslike proposal he has made to the House. I venture to ask the Chief Secretary to
 848
*(6.5.)  SIR JOHN POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : There can be no doubt that the statements of the gallant Colonel who has just sat down are entirely justified as regards the area of distress. It is evident from the reports that, along the coast of Kerry, and throughout the County Cork the gravest distress prevails, and that distress will be intensified week after week. This Vote is described as one for the relief of distress in Ireland. It amounts to £60,800, and in that sum we find items of £2,500 and £2,230 for the payment of Inspectors and officials employed in administering this comparatively small amount. How does it come to pass that 9 per cent. of this money is to be laid out upon officials? One answer will naturally occur to those who have been observing the action of the Chief Secretary for the past few months, namely, that these Inspectors of the Local Government Board in Ireland are employed in administering another fund—a fund amounting very nearly to £60,000—a fund which has been collected by Lord Zetland and the Chief Secretary under the famous letter of the 3rd of January last. Can we then deal with this sum of £60,000 and omit altogether from our consideration the £50,000 or £60,000 which has been collected by Lord Zetland and the Chief Secretary? It is impossible. In the letter to which I refer the Chief Secretary very kindly tells the British public what is the main necessity on which he bases that appeal. I venture to ask the attention of the House to the reason given by the right hon. Gentleman why the public should contribute to a charitable fund for Ireland. It is that there exists in Ireland a law which does not exist in England or Scotland, and the effect of that law is to render a charitable appeal necessary. Here is what the Chief Secretary said—
 "Outdoor relief, except, of course, in cases of emergency, cannot legally be administered

 MR. JOHN KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether, in view of the fact that the Treasury has sanctioned the payment of overtime in the Telegraph Department at time and a quarter for work performed after eight hours' employment, he is prepared to recommend that the clerks of the Savings Bank Department, who are compulsorily working overtime beyond eight hours a day, should be paid at a similar rate; and, if not, whether he can state the length of time which must elapse before he can propose to issue instructions that these clerks should not be compelled to work beyond the eight hours a day?
(6.40.)  MR. MACNEILL  (Donegal, S.) : The hon. and gallant Gentleman has referred with regret to the absence of Irish Members from this discussion, but let him be assured that he will have ample opportunity of renewing his acquaintance with Irish Members in his own constituency at the next election. Now let me turn with a few words to the interesting statement of the Chief Secretary. Very full and clear that statement was, and very significant, inasmuch as it admitted the existence of severe and even appalling distress in Ireland. I expected an admission of that, and it would have been strange if that admission had been absent from the statement. We cannot shut our eyes to the reports in the public Press, and we know that the Lord Lieutenant and the right hon. Gentleman, in their capacity of high officers of State, have actually solicited the charity of the world for Ireland. As I listened to the statement of the right hon. Gentleman—his statement of the amount of distress, its
 806 807 Times Times Times' 808
 MR. MACNEILL : Yes, and the Eight Hours Bill, too. I wish to be candid. On October 22 the result of the Eccles-election was declared, and on the 25th came the expedition to Mayo. And the result shows the benefit that in some respects would accrue from a short period of Home Rule even in the hands of the right hon. Gentleman. So long as he remained in England he could not believe in the distress. The expedition returned in three days. It was planned, so far as Mayo and Sligo were concerned, by an eminent Judge, who has four times received promotion from a Conservative Government. During this tour a remarkable document appeared, a pastoral signed by nearly all the Catholic Bishops, declaring the distress imminent and the country in a desperate condition, and imploring the Government, while the people were in want of food, not to allow the Forces of the Crown to be used to deprive the people of their homes. It was impossible to pay the rent, and the Executive were implored to do as the President of the Board of Trade once did in the case of the Clanricarde tenants to stay the arm of the law in the interests of justice and humanity. Well, the right hon. Gentleman came back from Mayo and Sligo, and of that tour I say nothing. I only wish to refer to the visit to my own constituency. We have evidence from the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fry) that the people are starving in Achill, and we have that in letters from the clergy of the district. I was looking over, a short time ago, a little volume, very amusing and, I may say, unconsciously comic, describing "Mr. Balfour's Tour," and in that is a picture of the
 809 810
 MR. MACNEILL : Hon. Gentlemen opposite do not like to hear the truth. Falcarragh is one of the most desolate places in the world. I have been in the Karroo Desert, and I can inform the House that that desert is a Garden of Eden compared with Olphert's estate in Donegal. The right hon. Gentleman heard from me that these people were Starving, but he did not take the trouble to go to Falcarragh, but ran away the next morning without even seeing Father M'Fadden, who could have given him the best information in the district. He saw Mr. Olphert, however, and the evictions took place two days afterwards. If the right hon. Gentleman had gone to Falcarragh, I believe he would have told Olphert, as the President of the Board of Trade when Chief Secretary told Clanricarde, "These people are starving, and I will not give you the forces of the Crown to assist in putting them out of their homes." The remarks of the right hon. Gentleman this evening have been fairly conciliatory, and I will give him some information in reference to the distress in one parish. In this parish no less than 66 able-bodied men have nothing to do. There is one district mentioned in the documents I have before me relating to the district of Killcar in my constituency, and it is described as the most congested district in all Ireland. The value of the potato crop there is given as one-fourth of the ordinary value, while the bulk of the potato crop is given at one-third of the ordinary bulk, and I have been told recently that nothing has been done for the relief of distress in this district. Nothing has been done, and the people are in a starving condition. The right hon. Gentleman knows the nature of the Donegal coast, and his experience has been that of every public man who has had to do with Ireland. The fishermen come and implore you for God's sake to do what you can to get them a few piers run out from the land,
 812 813
 MR. MACNEILL : I will not, then, say any more about that. I would, however, point out that as the finale of the Chief Secretary's tour in Donegal, no fewer than 250 families were deprived of food and housing.
 MR. J. MORLEY : I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman did not quite understand me. I said I did not believe an any gigantic scheme of Government reclamation, nor do I. I said, if reclamation is going to be carried out properly and promptly it should be done, with or without the assistance of the Government, by small men working for themselves in the first place.
 MR. J. MORLEY : The items have not been very clearly stated. The right hon. Gentleman has stated that he has been allowed by the Treasury to employ two boats on the west coast. Is the cost of these boats included? Of course, we know there must be a considerable expenditure for material. I have not gathered the amount of the expenditure upon seed potatoes. The right hon. Gentleman has made reference to certain frauds and errors being detected, such as might be expected in any operations of this kind. I have no doubt the Committee would be inclined to look with great leniency on any errors that may be brought to light. I have only to say that, at all events, we gather from the scheme of the right bon. Gentleman that when we and hon. Members representing Irish constituencies were charged in September and October last with having stated that there was real distress in Ireland in order to make political capital, there is now ample evidence in the Reports of the Inspectors that there is no truth in that charge, and that there is very real distress, which the right hon. Gentleman himself has now admitted. Putting it generally, as far as can be gathered from the Reports of the Inspectors, what is it that has happened? Simply this: that over one-half of Ireland there is a deficiency of one-fourth of the potato crops, and this seems to be the foundation of the scheme of the right hon. Gentleman. With respect to railways, I
 794
 MR. J. MORLEY : In that case, Sir, I shall make what remarks I have to offer on this point when the Railway Vote is taken. I only alluded to the matter because the right hon. Gentleman had already opened it in his statement. I may, however, be allowed to say that in regard to the question of the railway policy of the Government to which the right hon. Gentleman referred at considerable length, I should like to receive from him an explanation of the fact that no opportunity has ever been given for inviting tenders for the construction of the railways that are now being undertaken. I will reserve what remarks I have to make on that subject until the next Vote. I can only say that, as far as I am enabled to understand the operations set forth by the Chief Secretary, there is really no disposition on this side of the House to find fault or to offer any opposition.
(5.30.)  MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : I have no fault to find with the tone of the right hon. Gentleman's statement, or with the lines upon which the Government are proceeding, and I have only a few observations to make which are of a general character, and in offering them I shall, perhaps, be excused for rising before hon. Members from Ireland, who would interpose with greater local knowledge. The right hon. Gentleman has told the Committee that the land reclamation scheme from which in December he hoped for considerable results has now been abandoned. I, for one, do not greatly regret it, because, as I ventured to say in December, I believed the views of the right hon. Gentleman in the matter of land reclamation were not based on facts which could be sustained. The right hon. Gentleman's view was that reclamation should be undertaken on a large scale by the Government; but I ventured to point out that the only chance of effecting land reclamation lay in intrusting it to small men, each man reclaiming his own patch for his own benefit. Under the head of planting, I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman intends to go further, or whether the experiment of planting 1,000 acres is to be the end of his activity. I admit what the right hon. Gentleman has said about the backwardness of this country in the art of forestry. But the right hon. Gentleman forgot that within the last three or four years a Committee of the House has been sitting and has made certain important recommendations in reference to forestry, if not in Ireland, certainly in England and Scotland, and it is the fault of Her Majesty's Government that no steps have been taken to carry them out. I hope the Minister of Agriculture will pay attention to these recommendations of the Select Committee. The right hon. Gentleman has not been quite clear in explaining the amount of his estimate. Is the £60,000 to carry out the whole of his relief policy, or is it merely an instalment? I asked that question in December. I did not press the right hon. Gentleman then, nor will I press him now; but it would be convenient for the Committee
 793
 MR. J. MORLEY : The right hon. Gentleman has not said how many weeks that is to last. Am I to take it that it is a continuous expenditure?
 MR. J. MORLEY : Do I understand that £21,000 has been actually expended, and that the payment of £3,000 a week is going on?
(5.42.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I have listened to the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary with great attention, and on the whole I do not think there is much reason for quarelling with the course he has taken; but I do think there is some confusion in the statement he has put before us with regard to matters of fact. The right hon Gentleman proposes to pay the starving peasantry by three different scales of wages—a 12s. scale, a 7s. scale, and a 5s. 6d. scale; and in regard to the 12s. scale I suppose the right hon. Gentleman only refers to wages in connection with railway construction, which is a matter that does not come

 MR. P. J. POWER  (Waterford, E.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland if a Sub-Commission is soon to sit to hear applications for the fixing of judicial rents in the Unions of Kilmacthomas and Waterford; and, if so, about what date; and, if not, whether, in view of the number of tenants in those districts anxious to have judicial rents fixed, a Sub-Commission will be sent there?
 MR. P. J. POWER : I will put it down for to-morrow.
 MR. SAMUEL SMITH : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government has received any particulars of the massacre and outrage in Madagascar, reported in the French paper  Le Temps Times Madagascar News;
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether it is true that the Government of the United States has refused to ratify the General Act; and what effect, if any, such refusal would have upon the carrying out of that Act?
 MR. BURT  (Morpeth) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he will state why supervising duties in the telegraph branch at Newcastle-upon-Tyne are to continue to be performed under the proposed revision by clerks on a scale of £140 rising to £170 per annum, whilst in the local postal branch similar duties are provided for by the appointment of assistant superintendents (second class) on a scale rising from £170 to £200, and in offices already revised by assistant superintendents (second class) on a scale of £200 to £260 per annum; and whether he will take steps for remedying the grievances complained of?
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : Will the Irish Land Bill be the first business after Easter?
*(7.18.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I think there are two things with which the Committee need not trouble themselves. I do not think it has been gravely argued that an Irish Parliament could have solved all the difficulties which have been raised. In the second place, I do not think we are called upon to go into the question of evictions, whether in Donegal or in any other part of Ireland, for it cannot be successfully contended that evictions have increased during the distress, or even during recent times. Indeed, evictions have absolutely diminished, and therefore I need not trouble myself with either of those two arguments. There is one thing the Committee should remember in connection with this matter, and that is that we have had periods of distress in Ireland over and over again. I am not referring to the famine of 1846–7. We have had repeated periods of distress requiring the intervention of the Legislature or of private charity. Now, I want to know whether any man in this House is prepared to state that on any of those occasions one-half so much has been done for the people, or that it has been done half so well as on the present occasion? You may go back to 1880 when distress occurred, and two relief funds were brought into existence in Dublin. There was not half so much system or care in the administration of that relief as in that of the Government this year. Then, in 1886, we had the experiment tried by the right hon. Member for Newcastle in the West of Ireland, but I do not think the right hon. Gentleman himself would like to see that experiment repeated.
 814
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I think the hon. Member for Darlington said they were distributed; but in any large distribution of potatoes under any scheme, or system of inspection, we are bound to get dishonesty of that kind. In addition to that there has been a railway made at a distance of eight or ten miles; there have been relief works opened in the island; a road there between Dooagh and Keel—one of the most execrable I ever walked upon—is being repaired; and other works are being carried on. I heard the hon. Member for Donegal say the people cannot get to the railway. I said to the people when they were pleading with me to use my influence with the Government and the Chief Secretary to open the railway, "If this railway is made you will get a good deal of work." Then, even those able-bodied young men who had just come back from working in Scotland shrugged their shoulders and said, "It is too far," although the works were only seven or eight miles from their homes. Huts, bedding, and food have been provided for them, but these people think seven or eight miles from their own doors too far to go for work. What are the facts at the present moment? We have heard a good deal about the distress on the island. I say it is normal—though deplorable. Bat I am informed that there are seven buts, with bedding and everything ready, vacant at Newport now. The directors sent for 50 labourers to the island the other day, and only got eight. The hon. Member for Darlington went to the parish priest and got those tales of distress, and no doubt he was quite right in the course he took; but how does he come to say these measures are not sufficient, and that the Government is not doing its duty? I myself have had doubts whether the Chief Secretary's measures of relief would come in time for the pinch in the spring. I was afraid the works would not be in operation in time, but I am glad to say my fears have been falsified. I think the measures taken by the Chief Secretary with respect to the money expended on relief works, the providing of seed potatoes, the construction of railways, and the system of inspection established during this time of distress were admirably
 816
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : What business will be taken at the Morning Sittings of Tuesday and Friday, and what constitutes the special reasons for having Morning Sittings on those days?
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE  (Edinburgh, Mid Lothian) : May I ask whether, in view of the fact that the "counts out" during the present Session have almost wholly, and certainly by far the larger number, taken place on Friday nights, and also of the fact that Friday night is, a night on which the Government, by long-established and well-understood usage, have always been under the obligation of keeping a House, the right hon. Gentleman will take increased I means for the fulfilment of that obligation?
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for enforcing upon, me the duties of Her Majesty's Government. No one is better able than the right hon. Gentleman to recall to the consideration of any Government the duties which devolve upon it. I think, however, that, if the right hon. Gentleman will make a careful investigation of the circumstances relating to the "counts out" to which he refers, he will find
 769 770
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The state of public business constitutes the reasons for having Morning Sittings on those days. There are also several measures-which the Government are anxious to send to the Standing Committees, among them being the Public Health Bill and the Savings Banks Bill, and we also-wish to make progress with the Public Trustee Bill. The Government desire to deal with those measures in order as soon as possible to enter on the consideration of the Irish Land Purchase Bill.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I think it improbable that we shall be able to take them. There is the Tithe Bill, which will come down from the House of Lords, and we shall desire, if possible, to take the judgment of the House on the Amendments which the House of Lords-have introduced.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope so.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : No, Sir.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : It will not be taken.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH  said: On the first day after the holidays, Supply will be taken. That has always been the practice.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : No charge whatever has fallen upon the Estimates or the Votes of Parliament for these purposes. There has been no charge whatever upon the taxpayer for the conveyance of distinguished personages to and from the Continent during the past 12 months.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope we shall be able to do so, as it is desirable that we should part with that subject before Easter.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Certainly, Sir.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am not aware whether there is any truth in that Statement or not. The hon. Member has not given me notice of the question, or I would have informed myself.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : The only communiation I have had was with the hon. Member for Oldham (Mr. Maclean), when I answered his question some time ago. To the best of my recollection, he asked me to answer a question which he had placed on the Paper, and I begged him to postpone it in order that I might transmit the question to India and obtain a reply. There is no Correspondence on the subject which I am able to produce.
 MR. WILLIAM HENRY SMITH  rose in his place, and claimed to move, "That the Question be now put."
 *MR. JACKSON : A light railway as I should have thought the hon. Member would have informed himself from the proceedings before the Committee, may include a railway which may be 5 feet 3 inches.
 *MR. JACKSON : 74 miles in all.
 *MR. JACKSON : I explained just now it was for three railways.
 *MR. JACKSON : Yes.
 *MR. JACKSON : About 8,000,
 *THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : I am extremely glad to have the opportunity of answering the question which the right hon. Gentleman has asked so fairly. It is an important question, because it ought to be made clear what the arrangements have been with the Midland Great Western Railway Company. In answering a former question I did not quite catch the right hon. Gentleman's meaning. The right hon. Gentleman confused me, because he spoke of competition between promoters, not between contractors. They who were spoken of as promoters were those who went to the Grand Jury for the presentment. In this case there happened to be promoters
 835 836 837
 *MR. JACKSON : I ought to have mentioned that a Court of Inquiry has been held in each case under competent authorities, whose duty it was to check the estimates, and we have also had the estimates of the Board of Works checked by the most competent engineers.
 *MR. JACKSON : I am afraid the estimate is more now. The line, I believe, has been a little shortened, because there have been fresh surveys. The estimated cost of the Killala line is £65,937, to which the Treasury have agreed to contribute £44,000. The estimated cost of

 *MR. JACKSON : They have undertaken to work it in perpetuity.
 *MR. JACKSON : We found that the bargain was the best we could make, after the most careful inquiry into the whole matter.
 *MR. JACKSON : Certainly.
 *MR. JACKSON : It was enlarged.
 MR. JOHNSTON  (Belfast, S.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in consideration of the fact that the Census of the United Kingdom, is to be taken on Sunday, 5th April, he-will include that date in the Easter Holidays in order that Members may be enumerated in their own houses?
 MR. W. F. LAWRENCE  (Liverpool, Abercromby) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that Sunday labour is performed in the General Post Office, Liverpool, by stampers and sorting postmen, without any remuneration; and whether, having regard to his statement in the House in August last, he will see that in future such labour shall be paid for?
 MR. MACARTNEY : By the Plan of Campaign.
 MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : Mr. Chairman, I rise to Order. I desire to ask for the information of the Committee, and especially of Members on this side of the House, whether it is allowable on this Vote to go into all the details of the management of the Olphert estate and the relations of Mr. Olphert with his tenantry?
 MR. MACARTNEY : I desire to point out that in the Paper laid before the House with regard to the Poor Law Union in which Mr. Olphert's Estate is situated, not a single case of outdoor or indoor relief has been added since these occurrences.
 MR. SINCLAIR  (Falkirk, &c.) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether a person who is entered in the Valuation Roll as tenant but not as occupier, where no occupier is entered nor the premises marked "empty," is entitled to vote at a School Board election in Scotland?
 MR. TOMLINSON  (Preston) : I am not quite sure the word section ought to be used in this way.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he will lay upon the Table of the House a Return showing the amount actually expended on Army Services, outside the moneys voted by the House of Commons, for the services of the current year, and what is the amount intended to be similarly expended during the coming year outside the Estimates presented to this House? I beg also to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he will lay upon the Table of the House a Return showing the amount actually expended on Navy Services, outside the sums voted by the House of Commons, for the service of the current year, and also showing the amount to be similarly expended during the coming year outside the Estimates presented to this House?
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Can the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer say whether it will be laid on the Table in the course of a week or two?
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Will it be laid on the Table in the course of next week?
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Will the right hon. Gentleman give us notice when the Tithe Bill Amendments will be taken?
 MR. ALFRED PEASE  (York) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government has received any information respecting the shipment of a number of Indian British subjects, who are reported to have been taken to Mozambique, at the end of 1889 or the beginning of 1890, by Portuguese, ostensibly to work upon railroads, but in reality to be enlisted as soldiers; or as to what has become of these men, some of whom are reported to have been ill-treated, flogged, and sent "up country," and not to have returned?
 DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether his attention has been called to the statement published by Dr. Robert R. Rentoul, of Liverpool, to the effect that he had ascertained by inquiry, that during the year 1889, 6,321 "still-born" children were interred in 71 Burial Board cemeteries; that there are 1,100 Board cemeteries in

 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary of State for India upon being sufficiently restored to health to be in his place. I beg to ask him if the Secretary of State has any information of the recent growth in India (apart from Burma) of the Chinese habit of opium smoking, as distinguished from the opium eating always practised to a limited extent in India and other countries; if so, whether any inquiry has been made regarding the alleged greater temptations and injuriousness of the new practice of smoking; and whether any special steps have been taken to limit and restrain houses for the smoking of opium, and check the practice; or, if information on this subject has not reached the Secretary of State, whether he will inquire of the Government of India?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Is there any truth in the paragraph which appears in the  Times 748
 SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in the last few months, he has received deputations and communications from Lancashire Members on the subject of the Amendment of the Indian Factory Act, and Her Majesty's Government have consequently urged the demands of those Members on the Government of India; and if the Correspondence so occasioned, subsequent to the Despatches on the Berlin Conference already laid upon the Table, can be produced now that the Government of India has submitted a Bill to the Indian Legislature?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the
 760
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : The Cape Tariff is a high tariff, while that of Natal is a low tariff. There is a great discrepancy between the two.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs what is the official position of Mr. Johnston in African territories north of the Zambesi; whether he is an ordinary Consul; and whether he is to be, as stated in the  Times
*(11.30.)  SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : The hon. Member who has just spoken has expressed his satisfaction that Irish ratepayers are not to be made responsible for the result of this expenditure, and I understand that generally he approves of the policy of the Government. Now, my experience is that when I see Irishmen on both sides agreeing to a Government proposal, I say, "woe to the British taxpayer." Under such circumstances, we may expect the perpetration of jobs; and again I feel inclined to say, "Oh for an hour of the late Mr. Biggar." He was a man who thoroughly understood these things, and was ever ready to expose jobbery in connection with them. It may be a question whether it was better to pay moderate sums for plans never fulfilled or to devote larger sums to construct Irish railways by jobbery. I do say the House of Commons has been misled. Last year the Government made a comparatively moderate proposal, but now they bring forward a much greater scheme, under which these railways will be constructed by the large companies, and five-sixths of the money will be paid by the British taxpayer, for whom there is no prospect of the return of a single farthing. Why are these things done so readily in Ireland as compared with the cautious, hesitating way in which the demands of the Highlands of Scotland are met? The Irish Members are apt at agitation, and can
 852
 SIR H. MAXWELL : I believe the figure stated by the hon. Baronet may be taken as approximately correct. The fees on Private Bills go into the Exchequer.
 SIR H. MAXWELL : No payments have been made within the past 12 months from voted money for the hire of steamers between Great Britain and the Continent for the conveyance of distinguished personages.
 SIR H. MAXWELL : Any representation which is made will be carefully considered.
 SIR H. MAXWELL : A Memorial in relation to the construction of a pier at Castletownsend was received by the Board of Works in October, 1887, but I am not aware whether resolutions have been received from Public Bodies. So far as I know, there is no intention of taking any steps for providing a pier at Castletownsend.
 A LORD OF THE TREASURY (Sir HERBERT MAXWELL,  Wigton : I do not think it necessary to give any instructions as to the enforcement of penalties against publicans and others who sell
 753
 SIR H. MAXWELL : I will inquire further whether licences to sell stamps are refused to publicans, and I will communicate with the hon. Member.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : No official information on the subject has been received. There is no warrant for the interference of Her Majesty's Government, as it is not asserted that British subjects were injured. According to the newspaper reports, the persons implicated were to be immediately brought to trial.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : Some British Indians were enlisted by the Portuguese in Goa and were sent to Mozambique in January, 1890. In consequence of reports that the enlistment was irregular inquiry was made by the Indian Government, who ascertained that there had been no misrepresentation in the conduct of the business, which was not illegal. The men are understood to be still in the Portuguese service, in which they would be liable to be moved about, but no Report has been received respecting them since their first arrival.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON (for Sir J. GORST) : I must refer the hon. Member to the statement made on this subject by the First Lord of the Treasury on the 17th of February, to which the Secretary of State has nothing to add.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I am afraid that I cannot reply to these questions without notice. As the hon. Member knows, I am not answerable for Indian questions.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : The Senate has not ratified the Act. The effect of that refusal is not a matter upon which Her Majesty's Government can express an opinion.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Her Majesty's Government are aware that a project to form regiments of Kurdish Militia or Yeomanry is under the consideration of the Porte. The experiment would be watched with some anxiety, but it may be, on the other hand, that the disciplining and organising the tribesmen might have a restraining effect upon their irregular propensities. If judiciously carried out it would not violate, but would fulfil, the 61st Article of the Treaty of Berlin; and there is at present no ground for the intervention of Her Majesty's Government.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Mr. Johnston is Commissioner and Consul General. An ordinary Consul is stationed in a foreign country from the Government of which he receives an exequatur. Mr.
 761
(11.16.)  MR. JOICEY  (Durham, Chester-le-Street) : I was one of the Members who opposed the Light Railways Act; but I confess I am surprised to find to what extent Her Majesty's Government have availed themselves of that Act in order to increase the expenditure. I am not surprised that hon. Members from Ireland should compliment the Government for having spent so much money in Ireland, One of the chief arguments used by Her Majesty's Government when they introduced the Light Railways Bill was that there was to be an addition to the ordinary railway of the country, not in the shape of heavy railways but of light railways, and I am astonished to hear the Chief Secretary ask how is it possible to work a light railway in conjunction with a heavy one? I expected the railways made under the Bill would be practically of the same character as the ordinary railways of Ireland; because if you attempt to work any railway in conjunction with the ordinary railway system, you must make such a line as will not only carry the wagons but the locomotives of the railways with which the line is connected. I, from experience as a railway man, know that General Hutchinson will not pass any line or bridge which he is perfectly sure will not be equal to the strain. Notwithstanding what the Chief Secretary has said the Light Railways Act, which was passed last Session, is nothing more than a misnomer. I scarcely think it was right for the Government to put forward an estimate of £50,000, and then come to the House and ask for a supplementary estimate of £136,200. This is hardly a Supplementary Esti-
 849
 MR. JOICEY : Of what length?
(11.45.)  MR. JOICEY : I think hon. Members from Ireland have rather misinterpreted references from this side of the House. I am not surprised that hon. Members advocate the spending of British money in Ireland for any purpose which provides labour for their people. No doubt, if similar expendi-
 855
 MR. JOICEY : Yes; over £8,000 a mile! I do not think that is the kind of light railway the House contemplated when the Bill was passed. The Government applied to the House for £50,000, not having the slightest knowledge of how they were going to spend it. I gather from what has been said by the Secretary to the Treasury that it was spent in digging here and there, and making plans and sub-sections of the lines. But everyone who has had experience in these matters knows that it is the custom of contractors to take contracts for the whole of the work. The whole of the proceedings of the Government have been most unbusinesslike, and I feel this so strongly that, by way of protest, I move the reduction of the vote by £1,000.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham : In reply to the first question of the hon. Gentleman, I have to say that the Secretary of State has received no Reports which lead him to the belief that the practice of opium smoking, as distinguished from opium eating, is increasing. The reply to the second question of the hon. Gentleman is that special attention has been given to the subject in the North-West Provinces and Punjab, with the result that the number of licensed saloons has been greatly reduced.
 MR. LENG  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether his attention has been called to a published statement that the Army Prize Money and Legacy Funds for the year ending 31st March, 1890, amounted to £103,147; that out of this sum only £14 14s. was paid on account of prize shares to soldiers and their representatives, the cost of distributing which was £299 5s.; and whether, seeing that the claims on these funds are so small, he will consider whether the interest upon them could be beneficially applied to distressed Crimean veterans not in receipt of pensions who are now in danger of becoming paupers?
 MR. LENG : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether it is any part of the duty of the Inspectors of the Board of Supervision in Scotland to superintend the system of boarding out pauper children by Parochial Boards, and to report on the fitness of the Guardians selected, and the sufficiency and sanitary condition of the houses in which the children are boarded; and whether, if this has not been attended to hitherto, he will bring the subject under the notice of the Board with the view of securing that the condition of pauper children so boarded out shall be regularly reported upon?
*(11.11.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE : I agree with the last speaker that the people are very grateful to the Government; if you give people half a million of public money, they ought to be grateful. The Galway district was very poor indeed; if it was not, it would make its own railway. Yet there is to be a broad gauge railway constructed, and in consequence of the reduction of the gradients resolved upon, the engineering works will be enormously increased. The North Eastern, one of the best managed railways in England, made a railway the other day to a sparsely populated district of Northumberland, with a gradient of 1 in 50, but in a poor district in Ireland, where the people will not have the money to pay a third class fare, the gradient is to be reduced to 1 in 60. The Secretary to the Treasury argues that if the line were not broad gauge, the engines of the Midland Company could not run on it, and it would be useless. There is a broad gauge line up to Londonderry, and yet the branch lines running into County Donegal are of narrow gauge. Therefore the argument of the Secretary to the Treasury will not hold good for one moment. This business is a gross job. We are throwing away nearly half a million sterling, for we shall never see the money again, or get any interest upon it. The Secretary to the Treasury says the scheme is not opposed by the Members for Galway. My constituents would not object to be relieved from the public purse. I think the House has been very badly treated, for some months ago we were asked to vote money for light railways, and now we find that one of the railways to be constructed is to be of the most expensive kind.
*(9.38.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I listened with great attention to the right hon. Gentleman's opening speech. He laid great stress on the difficulty of obtaining accurate information as to the poverty and absolute need of the people in the distressed districts, but the whole drift of his information seemed to me to depend
 830
 *SIR J. SWINBURNE : I am very glad to hear I am mistaken, for how can the population have any sympathy with the police, whom I have myself seen assist at evictions? I am sorry to see that the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary has left the House. I wish to point out to him what I saw in a district which he carefully avoided when in Ireland, namely, the district of Gweedore and Falcarragh. At Falcarragh the police actually stoned the people in their own houses, so anxious were they to assist in turning the starving people out of their miserable cabins. I saw 150 police going out to assist in the evictions, and they assisted in storming the houses. How could the people have any sympathy with those officers? Why, the people there say that there is not a man amongst them worth his salt who has not been to prison. And yet the right hon. Gentleman says he gets his information supplemented by statements of the police. The people would rather starve than go to the police with their tales of distress. As to the right hon. Gentleman's statement that the people in many cases have acted fraudulently in dealing with seed potatoes, one can very well understand a woman with a starving family of little ones around her going to almostany length—even the length of false representation—to obtain a few potatoes for food. Then, as to the remarks of the hon. Member for Cork, who urged on the right hon. Gentleman the necessity for the construction of piers. I have lived on the south coast of Ireland for a year and
 831
 *SIR J. SWINBURNE : What I was pointing out was that if the right hon. Gentleman's words meant anything they meant that he relied on the reports of the police.
 SIR JULIAN GOLDSMID  (St. Pancras, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether the fees paid to the Private Bill Office of the two Houses of Parliament are on an average about £27,000 annually in excess of the cost of the Private Bill Office; and what is done with the balance?
 *SIR R. WEBSTER : I understand there will be no objection to a Return in order to see what the exact number of sittings-is and the time occupied by the County Court Judges.
 *THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : The figures given by the right hon. Gentleman regarding the number of sittings are substantially correct. I am informed by the Lord Chancellor that Orders are from time to time made under Section 10 of the County Courts Act, 1888, and every attempt is made in order to secure that the sittings shall be as full as possible. In many cases where a small number of sittings occur the time occupied by travelling is very heavy, and I am informed that this is the case in the instances contemplated by the right hon. Gentleman's question.
(6.18.)  MR. THEODORE FRY  (Darlington) : I am certain the House listened with the greatest interest to the Chief Secretary's statement of the work the Government have undertaken in various parts of Ireland, but I cannot help feeling that the hon. and gallant Member for Galway (Colonel Nolan) has hit one of the weakest parts of the right hon. Gentleman's statement, and that is, whether he has really commenced sufficient works in order to deal effectually with the distress which now exists. The right hon. Gentleman seems to think he has done all that is necessary for the relief of distress; or, at any rate, he appears to convey that the Government will have very carefully to consider before any other works of any kind are commenced in Ireland.
 MR. THEODORE FRY : I am glad of the correction. At all events, the right hon. Gentleman told us that, up to the present time, the total number of persons employed on the works is 7,300. Considering the population of Ireland, that number is exceedingly small. I am aware of the difficulty of starting relief works in a hurry; but I think that the right hon. Gentleman is disposed now to minimise the distress in Ireland just as he was some months ago. The right hon. Gentleman told us that the greatest care is taken to employ the most needy men; but when there are large numbers of men precisely in the same position, how are the men chosen for employment? The week before last I visited the Island of Achill. The population of the Island is about 8,000, and there are 317 persons employed in relief works. These persons are not all men, because I noticed a great number of able-bodied girls, and in some cases two or three members of one family at work. 317 is an exceedingly small number indeed to employ on relief work, espe-
 801
(11.33.)  MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I do not wish to detain the Committee; but I may explain to the hon. Member for Northampton that Glenties is the most populous of the towns in West Donegal: that is the centre of the stocking knitting industry; that there is a considerable amount of this work done, and there is a difficulty in getting it sent away. For this, among other reasons, there is no doubt that this particular line will be a boon to the people of West Donegal and a national benefit, even though the undertaking may cost the taxpayers something for the time. I am quite sure that the policy of the Government for the relief of Irish distress commends itself to the Irish people whatever their public opinions may be. But I take the opportunity of asking the Secretary to the Treasury why it is that North Donegal has been left out of these advantages? The claims of the districts of Inishboffen and Cardonagh have been urged, but I do not find that they been recognised. As there is no Representative of North Donegal present, and I had the honour of being its Representative in two Parliaments, I venture to ask the right hon. Gentleman if there is any prospect of railway works in North Donegal being commenced?
 *THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : I am very doubtful as to the necessity of inserting this clause. I see that the intention of my hon. Friend is to provide that this measure and the Act of 1889 shall be construed together. If, however, my hon. Friend refers to the Act of last year he will find that the residue of the money is to be applied within the meaning of the Technical Instruction Act of 1889, and if he refers to the Definition Clause of the Act of 1889 he will find that it covers manual as well as other technical instruction. At the same time as my hon. Friend assures the House that there is real doubt in the minds of members of County Councils—and nearly every County Council has appointed a committee to deal with the question of technical education, and as the clause is perfectly harmless, I will not oppose it.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I will inquire further into the matter. It is one of extreme difficulty. I have already gone into it carefully, as far as I can, and I
 752
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I do not think I can use the power of the Department to withhold grants. I do not think that under the Education Act I have the power to do that. I doubt whether the Department has the least power in the matter.
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : I have received a Report from the Inspector of the Rochdale and Oldham district confirming the substantial accuracy of the hon. Member's allegations. The reasons given in one case were that the school selected was one to which the firm had largely contributed, and that the requirement was necessary in order to secure discipline in the works and uniformity in keeping the time-books required under the Factory Acts; but how far this may be so I have no means of judging, nor have I any power on behalf of the Department to interfere, as there is nothing in the Education Acts to prevent an employer making attendance at a particular school a condition of employment in his factory.
*(3.35.)  EARL COMPTON  (York, W.R., Barnsley) : I think that if the House only heard the speech of the hon. Member who has just sat down hon. Members might arrive at a unanimous decision that the Second Reading of the Bill ought not to be passed. But there is another side to the question which has not been placed before the House, and I
 905 906
 *EARL COMPTON : I believe not; but it has been gone into by others, who are satisfied.
 *EARL COMPTON : That is a question which will have to be threshed out in the House of Commons. The scheme has received the sanction of the County Council, and I presume of the Home Secretary also. Another objection urged by the hon. Member is that if we do away with Shelton Street and close it we shall cover the whole of the area with buildings and increase its insanitary state. Now the chief object of the County Council is to leave a large air space in connection with any buildings they undertake to provide. If there is any question as to the want of air space

 *EARL COMPTON : We have approached that gentleman, but have failed to come to any arrangement, because his terms are too high.
 *EARL COMPTON : I have only stated the absolute and literal truth. We have attempted to negotiate with Mr. Corben, but his terms are so high that we have failed; and this very Mr. Corben is a member of the District Board of Works, now petitioning Parliament to require us compulsorily to acquire his property. Some objection has been raised to the London County Council erecting a lodging house, but an Act of Parliament was passed many years ago by Lord Shaftesbury to provide that lodging houses should be built in London. In Glasgow the municipality has built a

 *EARL COMPTON : Perhaps I may be allowed to remind the noble Lord that the original scheme was prepared by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and not by the London County Council.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FEEGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : Her Majesty's Government are awaiting a full Report from Her Majesty's Consul at Brunei, who proceeded to his post at the end of last year. Representations have been received from the Sultan, and he has been informed in reply that full inquiry will be made on the arrival of the Consul, and that it is hoped that an arrangement satisfactory to His Highness will be effected.
 EARL COMPTON  (York, W.R., Barnsley) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether it is a fact, as reported in the Press, that C. A. Lowe, a first-class postman attached to the E.C. Post Office, who had completed 17 years' service and was in receipt of 32s. a week, when off duty and in private clothes got into trouble with a policeman and, being charged, was fined 20s.; whether he was further punished by the Post Office authorities by being reduced to the second class, with wages of 23s. a week; whether this reduction is permanent; whether C. A. Lowe's character has been good in the past; and whether there is any precedent for punishing in so severe a manner a Post Office  employé
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAISES,  Cambridge University : The facts generally are as stated by the noble Lord. It was a question whether Lowe should not be dismissed, but I adopted a more lenient course in reducing him to the second class. Whether he remains permanently on that class must depend upon his conduct in future.
 EARL COMPTON : I would repeat the last sentence of my question.
 EARL COMPTON : May I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman will make inquiry as to whether the man has been before a Magistrate and punished by him; and whether a Magistrate who punishes a Post Office  employé
 DR. CAMERON.  I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the two fatal and mysterious explosions which have this week occurred in ironworks in Glasgow; and whether, with a view to preventing similar catastrophes, he will follow the practice adopted by the Home Office on various previous occasions in Scotland, and institute a special public inquiry into the causes of these disastrous occurrences?
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART-WORTIET,  Sheffield, Hallam : I will answer this question and that of the hon. Member for the Blackfriars Division of Glasgow (Mr. Provand) at the same time. The Crown Agent has called the Secretary of State's attention to one fatal accident at Dixon and Co.'s chemical works, and states that at present no idea can be formed of the origin of the explosion, and that until the  débris 923
 DR. CAMERON : I will ask a further question on the subject in a few days, and perhaps the hon. Member will then be able to give me more information.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : I do not think any useful object would be served in laying the Correspondence on the Table of the House. I should be happy to show it to the hon. Member if he calls on me at the Colonial Office.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : Perhaps the hon. Member will allow me to answer the question. It is difficult to see what special machinery can be devised for more promptly dealing with the misleading prospectuses and circulars addressed to intending emigrants; but the matter has already been several times brought to the notice of Her Majesty's Consuls, and will be brought to that of the emigration officers of the Board of Trade. Any information so received will be placed at once at the disposal of the Emigrants' Information Office for publication. In future it is contemplated that that office, in addition to its present pamphlets and newspaper notices, shall cause printed warnings to be exhibited as occasion arises at the various ports of the United Kingdom, and compile an annual summary as suggested. Other means of diffusing the desired information have been, and will be, carefully considered.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. DE WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The first part of the question correctly describes the condition of political affairs in the colony; but as to the concluding words, I may observe that although it is true that the gentlemen to whom the Governor applied have declined to act, it may be hoped that the new Governor may be able to fill up the places. A Petition for a change in the constitution, giving unofficial members a majority in the Legislature, has been received. Her Majesty's Government have replied that in a colony on the mainland of America, having relation with neighbouring foreign States for which the Crown is responsible, and containing only about 400 inhabitants of European descent out of a total population of 30,000, it is impossible for Her Majesty's Government to surrender its control over legislation and finance.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : The hon. Baronet will find full information in the Parliamentary Paper C 3075 of 1881, and there has been no change since then in the relations of the Colonial Office with the Crown Agents, who are appointed on fixed salaries. These officers derive no personal profit from the transactions of their office beyond their remuneration as fixed by the Secretary of State. No charge is incurred by Imperial Revenues in connection with the Crown Agents Office, and no receipts accrue to those Revenues. The Secretary of State is satisfied that economy and efficiency are secured in a notable degree by the employment of the Crown Agents.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury if it is a fact that the sum of £1,000 was advanced by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland to the Earl of Courtown for the purpose of repairing his pier; and whether any interest is paid thereon?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether any artizans not belonging to the County of Mayo and district concerned are employed on the Westport and Mulranny line of Light Railway; and, if so, how many are thus employed?
 DR. TANNER : I will put the question down for next Friday.
 DR. TANNER : With whom does it rest then?
(12.14.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : The hon. Member who has just sat down has talked about jobbery and robbery. Jobbery indisputably exists; robbery may be a fact. Many of my friends supported the Government in this Bill. They did so because their constituents were starving, and they thought it well to get what they could out of the Government. Anything is better than nothing. I would not vote for the Government for the simple reason that I got nothing. I wanted to have three lines of light railway constructed. The right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary disappointed my constituency in the matter, and I voiced the dissatisfaction of those poor people in the only way open to me last night.
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : May I ask why the right hon. Gentleman has put down this Motion? Is it necessary? Up to now have we not taken Report of Supply after 12 o'clock?
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I do not intend to oppose the adoption of the right hon. Gentleman's Resolution, but I should like to express the opinion that, by the unwise course which the First Lord of the Treasury proposes to take, he will lessen his opportunities of expediting public business rather than increase them. The Government would have done better to have waited until there had been factious opposition to Report of Supply. It is well the Government should now understand that if we adopt this Motion it will not do for them to attempt to shorten Debate in Committee of Supply on a promise that the discussion shall be renewed on Report.
 *MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : The Bills must be referred to various Local Authorities for report thereon; and before we discuss them, it is very desirable that Metropolitan Members should be placed in possession of the views of those bodies.
*(5.33.)  MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : I venture respectfully to draw attention to two precedents in connection with this very Committee. In the first place, it was appointed to consider the tenure of houses, and afterwards there was referred to it the subject of leasehold enfranchisement. Though it had not reported in 1889 a Debate took place on the Second Heading of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Bill; in fact, the Report was not presented until three months after that. The second precedent was this: In 1886 a Motion was submitted by Mr. William Saunders, then Member for Hull, covering the ground of this Motion, and it was referred to the Committee. Subsequently, Professor Thorold Rogers moved a Resolution to the effect that the owners of the ground value should be made to contribute towards local taxation. I venture to think that those are two exact precedents. As a matter of fact, the present Motion does not cover the entire Reference to the Committee, inasmuch as it deals only with the Metropolis, and not with the general question which is under the consideration of the Committee. Besides that part of the Reference affecting the Metropolis has already been dealt with, and there only

 *MR. LAWSON : For London only.
*(7.12.) MR. LAWSON : The hon. Member for Leeds is unable, by the Forms of the House, to move the Amendment he has placed upon the Paper. But he did his best to interpret its sense, and it seems to me rather curious that time after time, when Resolutions in favour of reform are brought forward, it is thought wise to meet them, not with a direct negative but with a dilatory Motion, such as the Amendment which the hon. Member opposite has placed upon the Paper, but which the Forms of the House prevent him from moving. This subject has
 960 961 962 Octroi, "Having regard to the progressively increasing charge on the Metropolis for the general purposes of the Board, and to the growing demands of the community for every kind of improvement, not merely to correct all the defects and neglects of centuries in the management of local affairs, but to satisfy the requirements of a daily increasing desire for greater convenience and even adornment of the Metro-
 963 "When the owner and occupier have entered into an agreement to pay all rates for a definite period, it is, of course, indisputable that the excess of rates falls exclusively upon the occupier." "(1) Two different sets of persons believe they are paying. (2) A sense of injustice has sprung up in consequence of a portion of those local taxes being devoted to permanent improvements by which the owner who does not pay gains so much as the occupier who does pay. (3) Disadvantage of exemption from administrative point of view. It can scarcely be overlooked that the result of the present law has been to impose many charges upon the occupier, which neither he nor the owner foresaw when they entered into the bargain." "Since 1839 £6,500,000 of new taxation have been imposed for new purposes. No one can deny that real property bears an amount falling far short of the whole, the balance being part from the profits of the tenant farmer and by the occupiers of houses, or, as I have elsewhere styled them, the consumers of a commodity called a house, a commodity which I frankly admitted to be very heavily taxed. The result of the present state of things has been that many great improvements in the Metropolis, in Liverpool, in Manchester, and other large towns have been much within the last 10 years exclusively at the cost of the occupier without the landlords contributing a single shilling towards the expense." 964 965 "I would suggest that the fund from which to help the ratepayers should be a proportion of the Death Duties on local and visible property. From the Exchequer contribution London at present receives £823,000 a year, about one-half of which comes from licences, and one-half from probate. The rateable value is now £31,700,000. Let us assume it to be £30,000,000 and to be worth 25 years' purchase. The capital value would be £750,000,000. According to the best information I can get from the Inland Revenue the average length of life of an owner of London property may be put at about 25 years. If so, the £750,000,000 will change ownership by death every 25 years, and there will fall to be taxed by Death Duties every year £30,000,000. Three per cent. on this would give £900,000." 966
 *MR. LAWSON : That was the Chancellor of the Exchequer's argument.
 *MR. LAWSON : I never said anything of the sort.
 *MR. LAWSON : Sir Thomas Farrer.
 *MR. LAWSON : I spoke of the need for street improvements in the East and South of London, and also of the necessity of dealing with the questions of open spaces and housing of the working classes.
 *MR. LAWSON : Not at all.
 *MR. LAWSON : Presently.
 *MR. LAWSON : The present debt still outstanding is £40,000,000.
 MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board, having regard to the fact that under existing statutes it is required in all counties and boroughs that all printed lists of persons entitled to vote, claiming to vote, and whoso names are objected to, shall be published at latest on 25th August of each year, whether it would be possible to allow the declarations of amendment

 *MR. LAWSON : May I ask how the right hon. Gentleman proposes to meet the confusion that it is said will arise in certain counties in view of the Bill having been withdrawn?
 MR. PROVAND  (Glasgow, Blackfriars, &c.)  also asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department if his attention has been drawn to an extraordinary accident which occurred at Dixon's Iron Works, in Glasgow, on Tuesday last, which resulted in the loss of five lives; and if he will direct an inquiry to be made into the circumstances of the accident in order to discover its cause?
 MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I desire to ask the Postmaster General whether Mr. Robert Munro has been appointed Postmaster at Lairg, Sutherlandshire; and, if so, upon whose recommendation; whether he has received a Petition, signed by 147 householders within the postal district of Lairg, disapproving of the appointment of Mr. Munro, on the ground that they had no confidence in him for the office; and whether, in view of this circum-

 MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND : Will the right hon. Gentleman inform us if the Petitioners objected to Mr. Munro on any other grounds than that he is engaged in business?
 MR. A J. BALFOUR : I shall not be able to give the hon. Member an answer, as the matter does not rest with me.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : I am afraid I am not in a position to give the hon. Member any information on this subject.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The persons who employ the labour.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Commissioners report that they intend to send a Sub-Commission to County Waterford at an early date.
 MR. JEFFREYS  (Hants, Basingstoke) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture if he can state the reason why 38a. 3r. 27p. of glebe land at Saxlingham, belonging to the rectory of Thetford St. Cuthbert, Norfolk, were sold for £112, or less than £3 an acre, as stated in the Return of Glebe Lands (Sales) recently presented to Parliament; who was the purchaser of the said land; and if £3 per acre is the average price of land in that locality?
 *MR. SPEAKER : That would be contrary to the Standing Orders, which provide that, after any business exempted

*(5.26.)  MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! I wish to call attention to the position in which this Motion stands. The House will remember that the Town Holdings Committee, which has sat for several years, was re-appointed in 1889; but, owing to want of time, was not able to make a Report last Session. Two days ago that Committee was re-appointed for the purpose of inquiring into a special subject, namely,
 "The question of imposing a direct assessment on all owners of ground rents, and on

(12.3.)  MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : The definition which the right hon. Gentleman has just given us is interesting and, I believe, novel. I should like to know in what Act it is to be found, as it is entirely at variance with

 *MR. RADCLIFFE COOKE : At any rate, the hon. Gentleman is a Member of that august body. When the London

 *MR. RADCLIFFE COOKE : I thought the hon. Member spoke as the mouthpiece of the London County Council.
 *MR. RADCLIFFE COOKE : Then I misunderstood the hon. Member, but it seemed to me that he spoke of social reforms without describing what these reforms were. Confident as hon. Members may be in the powers and integrity of the London County Council, some of us would like to know the character of the social reforms they propose to carry out before we give them money for effecting them.
*(9.38.) MR. RADCLIFFE COOKE  (Newington, W.) : The hon. Member who has just sat down expressed a hope that some practical result would follow this Debate. I cannot say I think it is very discreet of those hon. Members who think with him to bring forward a Resolution, which is likely to be negatived, with the view of strengthening the Committee upstairs. The rejection of this Resolution will rather weaken the action of the Committee than strengthen it. I accept pretty nearly as my own the excellent speech delivered by my hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Mr. Whitmore). I am, perhaps, somewhat at variance with some Members on this side of the House in thinking it desirable that the rates should be divided between occupiers and owners; and I am also of opinion, in regard to ground rents, that there is a period in the existence of such rents when the ground owners do not pay their fair share of the improvements effected by the expenditure of the rates. At the commencement of the period the parties contracting will see for themselves what new rates are likely to be imposed, and will make their terms accordingly. Towards the end of the term the reversioner will, of necessity, if he takes possession of the property, have to pay the rates on the enhanced scale. In that way he will pay on the value of his reversion, but there is a time between these two periods when, in my judgment—as a question of incidence of taxation—the ground landlord does not pay his fair

 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : I may remind the hon. Member that my hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Mr. Whitmore) has spoken.
 *MR. RITCHIE : The Government are considering the question, and I hope in a few days to be able to inform the House of the result of their investigations.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : If the revision of the lists commenced on the 1st September, as suggested, and the lists of claimants and persons objected to were not published until the 25th August, sufficient time would not be allowed for persons to see the claims and objections and make the declarations. The result might be that many persons objected to might lose their votes; because, in practice, the objections are not sent until the last moment. It would not, I think, be right to allow the declarations to be made at any time before the sittings of the Court, as there would be no sufficient opportunity of inspecting them.
*(4.5.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam : I have a good deal of sympathy with my hon. Friend who has moved the rejection of the Bill, and in nothing I have to say shall I find fault with the natural and proper solicitude he has displayed for the particular district in which it is proposed to carry out this scheme. But we have to consider what the circumstances are. In the first place, it is not a very large scheme: secondly, it is a very old scheme; and, thirdly, it was never a very good scheme. As my hon. Friend (Mr. Gainsford Bruce) has referred to the action of the advisers of the Home Office, it is only right that I should say that those advisers, in reporting upon the scheme, have expressed regret that the original plan was not a wider one, because in that event it would have included a larger area of insanitary property. We have now to consider whether at the present day, many years after the original scheme was propounded, the plan now submitted is the best way of dealing with this particular area. My hon. Friend is right in saying that, in regard to a certain class of cases where the accommodation for re-housing the working classes is proposed to be reduced below a certain limit, the authority of the Secretary of State is absolute, and he has power to make modifications, even in a scheme which may have received the approval of Parliament. At the same time, there are other such cases, such as the present case, which cannot be finally decided by the Secretary of State, but which have, according to the apparent intentions of the Legislature, to be considered by a Select Committee. The Secretary of State being
 910 bonâ fide 911
 MR. STUART WORTLEY : Yes, Sir; I am quite aware that there are several industries outside the immediate petroleum trade to which the Inflammable Liquids Bill will apply, but the great majority of these industries are already subject to the provisions of the existing law. In those cases where the proposed extension of the law will include new industries and products, I shall be fully prepared to consider any representations from the trade which, having due regard to public safety, will justify Amendments to the present Bill.
*(7.7.)  MR. WHITMORE  (Chelsea) : Had it been possible to move the suggested Amendment, I should have desired to second it. I have no wish to hang up this important question, and I do not deny that the present incidence of rates in London is a matter of the greatest interest to the population of London; but I say that when the House comes to legislate upon the question it ought to do so with authentic information before it, and after it has received the practical suggestions of the Select Committee in a form rather more distinct than have been the suggestions brought forward to-day by the hon. Member for Hoxton. In the meantime, I must say I hope that when the Committee inquires into this subject it will take a large view of the question of local rates. In former years, local rates were levied for a very limited number of local objects, and the burden was imposed entirely on realty. But gradually a vast quantity of objects have been brought into the area to which local rates are made to apply. All the tendencies of the time are in the direction of increasing the number of public objects on which local rates will be levied. In the last 10 years how many new public buildings have been erected, new open spaces laid out, new free libraries built, new baths and washhouses opened? All these are public objects, the utility of which I should be the last to dispute. Every sign seems to show that year after year more money will be spent on sanitary, educational, and architectural objects. I welcome that state of things. In the future the use of corporate machinery and agencies for the common good of local districts will add largely to the comfort and prosperity of the community; but I do say that in the future it will be impossible to keep the whole of the ever-increasing consequent burden on the shoulders of the owners and occupiers of land. It is impossible to distinguish in their nature between local public objects and those more national objects for which Imperial taxation is

 MR. NORRIS  (Tower Hamlets, Limehouse) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if he can give any information as to the position of affairs between the Sultan of Brunei and Raja Brooke; and if the Sultan has addressed any further protest to the Government.
 MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : I wish to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he will lay upon the Table the Correspondence between the Government of Mauritius and the Colonial Office with reference to the case of the ex-Sultan Abdullah of Perak?
 *LORD H. BRUCE : My argument is that upwards of 1,200 of the working classes have been cleared off or evicted. Originally it was proposed to re-house 660 of them, and now the scheme has been so whittled down that accommodation is only proposed for 608.
*(4.12.)  LORD H. BRUCE  (Wilts, Chippenham)  complained that the County Council had not carried out the original scheme of re-housing 660 of the displaced persons.
 *MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE : What did the County Council offer?
 *MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE : Has any offer ever been made to Mr. Corben?
 *MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE : What evidence was given, and by whom, that Mr. Cubitt Nicolls' original plan was impossible?
 *MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE : Was the matter gone into by Mr. Cubitt Nicolls?
*(3.10.) MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE  (Finsbury, Holborn) : I beg to move "That the Bill be read a second time this day six months." The Bill is a Provisional Order Bill, and it seeks to modify to a serious and mischievous extent a scheme for the improvement of an unhealthy area in the district of St. Giles made under the Artisans' Dwellings Act and confirmed by an Act of Parliament in 1887. The London County Council are now the body charged with carrying out this improvement scheme; but they have done nothing since they have been in existence to carry it out, and they now come here to ask the House to relieve them of their obligations. The scheme of 1887 to which I refer was not a heroic scheme; it did nothing more than was absolutely necessary for the health of a particular area, and I trust that the House will insist upon the scheme being carried out. When I remind the House that a very large number of the working people of London find employment in St. Giles, and are compelled to reside near their employment, hon. Members will see that anything that affects the sanitary requirements of the district is not unworthy of the serious attention of the House. I oppose this Bill because I believe that, if passed, it will aggravate and perpetuate some, of the worst evils of an unhealthy district, will operate with grievous injustice to the working classes of St. Giles, and will sanction an instance of trafficking in land on the part of a Public Body, which, if it were allowed to become general, would give

 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : The question whether persons who insure in American companies can claim rebate of Income Tax on their premiums has been authoritatively settled by the Courts, and I am not prepared to propose any alteration in the law. The difference of treatment of British and of American Insurance Companies does not rest
 921
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : Which? Ground rents or ground values?
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I do not understand "presently."
*(10.8.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I believe when it was suggested earlier in the evening that the Motion ought not to be entertained because there was a Committee sitting, it was called a dilatory suggestion. I can assure the House with all earnestness that that is not our opinion at all. But we did and do consider, and we are strengthened in that view by what has passed, that it is impossible to come to any conclusion on the question now submitted to the House until we have the evidence and the Report of the Committee, which we trust will throw light on the subject. I think two hon. Members suggested this was dilatory action—the hon. Member for St. Pancras and the right hon. Member for Derby.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : But how about the debts incurred next year and the year after, and the year after that again? I think we mast take care that the County Council, who are ambitious, and who have many plans, many of which will redound to the prosperity of London, should not get into the belief that they might be able to contract debts or increase expenditure, thinking that it may be thrown on the future reversioner while it is voted by the present occupiers. It is suggested that we are to find increased resources which will be spent by the County Council. So far as that goes, I sympathise to a great extent with the ratepayers and the occupiers of London. I think there is a great deal to be said for hon. Members utilising the whole of their ingenuity and straining every nerve to see whether they can discover fresh sources of revenue by which the improvements of London can be carried out. An hon. Member behind me suggested that personal property should be asked to contribute in order to assist the improvements of the Metropolis. Other hon. Members have pointed out the difficulties that stand in the way of our adopting such a course, and I am glad to find the hon. Member for St. Pancras, although a political opponent, is satisfied with what the Government have done in that direction. Her Majesty's Government have done their best to come to the rescue of the ratepayers by endeavouring to render personal property liable to local taxation. I may, however, say that I do not think
 996
 *MR. GOSCHEN : This Debate has been singularly free from any display of Party feeling, and therefore I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will admit that we have made an honest effort to assist the ratepayers of the Metropolis, and have done our best to afford them relief by bringing personal property into assessment. Hon. Members, however, must not suppose that this subject is altogether free from difficulty. One well-meant attempt which I made to relieve the local rates did not meet with the success that I think it deserved. When I heard the hon. Member for Shoreditch pleading in eloquent tones in favour of the poor ratepayers of the Metropolis, pleading for further funds for carrying out social reforms, I thought of what had been the fate of my proposal known as the Van and Wheel Tax. Notwithstanding the strong arguments in favour of that tax, so many objections were taken to it that even the strong desire that existed to place a source of additional funds at the disposal of the County Councils could not over-ride them. I venture, with great deference to hon. Members opposite, to inform them, as one who has suffered, that the next tax, whatever it may be, which they may propose in aid of the resources of the County Councils will receive precisely the same amount of opposition that was offered to the Van and Wheel Tax, and that they will be unable to bring it forward without such an opposition as may, if time be limited, lead to the defeat of the proposal. The hon. Member for St. Pancras called upon the Government to come to the assistance of the ratepayers, and asked whether we could not do something to relieve them from the oppressive burden which was imposed upon them. All I can say is that I am satisfied that whatever new tax might be proposed for the purpose of relieving the ratepayers, would be opposed with far more energy than the ratepayers would display in its support; and I am afraid that even
 997
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I should like to say that to-night this subject has been treated with singular prudence and moderation, and we have heard of none of those wilder suggestions which have often been made in reference to this subject. We have not seen the great
 998
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I will try not to be led away by interruptions. I say the task is almost impossible. The freeholder has paid the full value of the site and he has paid the full value of his house. How are you going to subject one part of his property to a particular tax? This is not a matter which so much touches the reversioner as the person who is the owner of the leasehold,
 999 1000 1001
 *MR. GOSCHEN : Yes; it is an interesting calculation; I do not know upon what it is founded, but before I can accept the calculation it will have to be very narrowly scrutinised. I think the same hon. Member said the person who lived in the locality would pay the tax; I presume he meant to say it was the person who died in the locality who would pay the tax. But the point is that you are going to put the Succession Duty upon this £30,000,000. I have endeavoured to prove that this £30,000,000 is not realty in the ordinary sense; and if you put on this Succession Duty you will either have to be content with a smaller sum than £30,000,000, or you will have to tax for the Succession Duty the improved ground-rents of every form of leasehold property. Leasehold property pays Probate Duty as well as Succession Duty, and now you propose, in order to secure the £900,000 which is to be raised from Succession Duty, to tax the whole of that £30,000,000. I say, again, such a proposal would land you where you little expect to be landed. You would have to tax not only the reversioner, but the countless interests which I have analysed, before you would be able to realise your calculation. The question of increasing the Succession Duty stands upon its own merits. What I wish to point out is
 1003 1004 pari passu 1005 1006 1007
 *MR. GOSCHEN : No, the right hon. Gentleman did not say it was a dilatory action, but, with a wave of the hand—that grand wave of the hand—he said—
 "We understand the way in which inconvenient Motions are got rid of by referring them to a Select Committee." 992 "That three years' time ought to be allowed to elapse before a reduction would be made from the owner's rent in respect of the rates," 993 994 995
 *MR. GOSCHEN : Quite so. That is the point I will explain. Mr. Fletcher Moulton wants to tax them. Whatever goes on scarcely touches them at all. They have got a terminable annuity. Therefore, we come to this—that we do not deal with bloated landlords, but with persons interested in these ground-rents, who consider them the safest and best security into which they can possibly enter. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bury rather suggested that these investments were made popular because I reduced the interest on Consols. But did not debentures of Railway Companies and mortgages on land, which equally constitute terminable annuities, benefit from the same cause; and why-should I pick out a particular form of annuity for special taxation? I believe these ground-rent investments are very popular among Building Societies, Savings Banks, and Charities. I hope I have dealt fairly with the argument of the hon. Gentleman. What I am anxious to do is to analyse the case of the owners of ground values, because it is important there should not be any false ideas abroad in regard to the subject. I fancy, if the County Council should have the idea that in this £30,000,000 sterling they have got a nest egg which they can use for taxation purposes, they will find that this sum will be diminished by the leasehold values, belonging to men, many of whom are already great contributors to rates, by the ground-rents, and by a vast number of other interests which they will scarcely wish to touch. I do not say, it is for the Committee to say, whether they ought to be touched or

 *MR. GOSCHEN : Owners of ground rents included?
 MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : Will the Lords Amendments to the Tithes Bill be taken before Easter?
*(6.45.)  MR. G. W. BALFOUR  (Leeds, Central) : I am rather surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Hoxton, after the suggestion you, Sir, made for the benefit of the House, should, notwithstanding, have thought it right to persevere with his Resolution. But I shall be still more surprised if he carries a majority with him into the Lobby. I have placed on the Paper an Amendment founded on the view which you have expressed; and I venture to think that view is not only in accordance with the usual practice of this House, but is also in accordance with the obvious dictates of convenience and propriety. It is not the practice of the House, nor is it desirable, that we should pass judgment upon a question pending the deliberations of a Committee appointed to consider it. Least of all should this be done in the case of
 952
 *MR. G. W. BALFOUR : The hon. Member, at all events, admits that the existence of contracts makes a difference which must be taken account of. Then, again, if a change in the present system is contemplated, we have to consider what system to adopt in its place, and in doing so we shall have to exercise the utmost caution, otherwise it may happen that the supposed remedy will merely aggravate the evil it is intended to remove. Lastly, if we come to the conclusion that no substantial injustice is done by the present system, and no change is required on that account, we have to consider whether increased values of grount-rents, and vacant building-land are not proper objects for the imposition of a completely new tax. But this involves an inquiry more difficult even than any of the preceding, for it raises the question of the general principle of taxation in this country, and of substituting taxation on capital value for taxation on income. All these questions are under the consideration of the Committee that is now sitting to inquire into the subject. In these circumstances, I repeat it would be not only against the general tradition of the House but against the dictates of
 958
 *MR. G. W. BALFOUR : I have been assured that the evidence taken was all from one side, and, so far from this being an argument in favour of this Resolution, a strong reason is afforded in the other direction. I do not think that under the circumstances it is essential that I should endeavour to refute the arguments the hon. Member for Hoxton has brought forward. It will be sufficient if I can show to the House that his Motion is premature—I mean in the sense that it asks the House to come to a judgment on this matter before the House is prepared to come to a judgment. I submit that in appointing this Committee only two days ago the House has clearly shown that in its opinion more light is required to be thrown upon the subject before it can express a decision. Nevertheless, it may be proper and convenient that I should follow the line of argument adopted by my hon. Friend the Mover of this Resolution. The Resolution raises questions not only of the very greatest importance but, as everybody will admit who listened to the speech of the hon. Member, questions of the greatest difficulty. I gladly recognise the ability which marked that speech and the moderation of its tone, but the hon. Member made a good many observations in the course of it which I do not say I differ from, because, being a member of the Committee, I do not wish to express a definite opinion, but observations, upon the accuracy of which there exists much difference of opinion. First let me observe, the actual terms of the Motion refer to the Metropolis alone. The Preamble to the Motion, however, has no such limited application—it is general in its terms—
 953 "To call attention to the unfair incidence of local taxation in London and other large towns." "That the freeholders and owners of ground values in the Metropolis ought to contribute directly a substantial share of local taxation." 954 955
 *MR. G. W. BALFOUR : I accept the hon. Member's correction. I do not understand whether any of the proposals he mentioned offer, in his view, anything like a complete solution. I will only observe that there seems to be a great variety of nostrums to deal with the situation—I will not call them nostrums, that may seem an offensive term prejudging the question; but the very variety of the remedies proposed forms an additional and strong reason why we should not now come to a decision, and why we should leave the Committee to their deliberations. The hon. Gentleman said this proposal was made in the interest of the poor. I have not the least doubt he was perfectly sincere in saying so; but many think the people who would gain from the change would not be the poor—certainly not occupiers on short tenancies—but the building owner or middleman of some kind or other. Here, again, I say this is a point on which we require further information. I have in the remarks I have made avoided expressing an opinion of my own, partly because I am a Member of the Committee and partly because I think the House ought to reject the Motion quite independently of the wisdom or error of the views it expresses. But I would remind the House of the extreme difficulty and complexity of the various matters which must be taken into consideration before we can arrive at a final judgment with regard to this question. First of all, we must consider whether ground rents have already paid rates, and, if so, what proportion of the rates? Next we must consider what are the interests usually concerned in house property in London, what part they respectively bear in contributing to rates, and what benefit each of them obtains from the expenditure of the rates. For instance, it has been brought to common knowledge by the inquiries of the Committee, that in London almost all house property involves three interests—that of the occupier, that of the building owner, and that of the ground landlord. Before we can determine the question of the rating of ground rents and ground values we must ascertain what is the relation between the freeholder and the building owner, and then what is the relation between the building owner and the occupier with regard to the
 957
 MR. CHAPLIN : The hon. Member must be aware that it would be altogether unusual and most inconvenient for a Minister to explain the provisions of a Bill not yet introduced by way of question and answer across the floor of the House. I am afraid, with no intention whatever of discourtesy to the hon. Member, that that is the only reply that I can give him. I may add that to the assumption contained in the question that the price of holdings is to be fixed by the Government at 30 years' purchase, or at any other number of years' purchase, is purely gratuitous.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : I am informed that the property in question was in a deplorable condition, entirely uncultivated, one mass of water grass and weeds, the arable part of it, upwards of 35 acres, not having been ploughed for years, the surface soil very thin and strong, on a subsoil of tenacious clay, and the property altogether of a very undesirable character. For four years previous to 1888 no tenant could be found for the farm, which is nearly 50 miles from the benefice of Thetford, to which it belonged, and the tenant to whom it was afterwards let was unable to pay any rent. For these reasons, and because it was a source of trouble and anxiety to the incumbent, and for the interest of the benefice, the property was sold. The land is subject to a tithe rent-charge, and the purchaser was Mr. Frederick Wilson, a farmer, living about two miles distant. The case is quite exceptional, and there is no reason to suppose that £3 an acre is the average selling price of land in the locality.
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : I am not asking the Government to alter the Standing Orders at all, but to give an undertaking that, in the circumstances I have referred to, they will move the Adjournment of the House, which would override any Standing Order.
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : Will the Government undertake not to allow a stage of a Bill to be taken after 1 o'clock?
 MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I would ask whether we are to understand that in the event of a Debate on Report of Supply or of Ways and Means being protracted until 1 o'clock, the ordinary limit of time for the Sitting of the House, and the business of the Report being at an end, some Member of the Government will move the Adjournment of the House?
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : Ground rents or improved ground rents. I know there are intermediate leaseholders, but so far as ownership is concerned this Resolution may be construed as dealing with the freeholders. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bury says the Resolution might be extended to include other towns, and that is not unreasonable. He knows

*(11.22.) MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : The Chancellor of the Exchequer all through his singularly able speech has attached enormous importance to the deliberations of the Committee which has now been sitting for some five or six years. I agree with him that if we were about to settle the details of this question it would be advisable to have a fuller and more complete investigation than can possibly be afforded by a Debate in this House. The right hon. Gentleman has avoided to a great extent dealing with the principle of the Resolution, and has raised, with great ability, many objections on points of detail. He has said we ought to wait for light to be thrown upon this question by the Committee. I venture to say that we do not
 1008 "Is not the Board of Works, as at present constituted, a machinery for improving the property of the landlords in reversion at the expense of the tenants?" 1009 "I am not able to say that we have been appointed for that purpose; but the practical result is that we do improve the value of property in the way that I have described, and that the landlord does not contribute a fair share towards the cost of these improvements." 1010 1011 1012
(9.46.)  SIR H. JAMES  (Bury, Lancashire) : I am aware that the Amendment of the hon. Member for Shoreditch refers only to what he terms the ground values within the Metropolis; but the question is a very broad one, and affects some communities even more directly and to a greater extent than that of the Metropolis. If the House should accept the Amendment, and it becomes the substantive Motion, I should move to strike out the words "in the Metropolis," so as to bring it to bear upon the rest of the country. Whilst I am, in accordance with the terms of the Amendment, now dealing with the question as affecting the Metropolis, there are some general and very grave considerations which arise affecting the whole of the country. There are communities in Lancashire, the interests of which have been prominently called to my attention, which are suffering at this moment more than the Metropolis from the peculiar and unfair manner in which local taxation is raised. The House must recollect that this question is not one of mere money payment—of whether the burden is to be borne by the occupier or the owner. The occupier is the person who elects the representatives to the Sanitary Authority; he is the person who virtually has to determine whether there shall be a full and proper bearing of the burdens cast upon the community by the Legislature; and if it happens that the burden upon the occupier is too great, he will fail in his duty in carrying out the intentions of the Legislature in

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I have seen in various local newspapers accounts of these proceedings confirming the facts as stated.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am not aware of any other grounds having being stated in the Petition. But the Memorial is not addressed to me. A copy of the Memorial reached the Post Office without any signatures attached to it.
 *MR. RAIKES : Mr. Robert Munro has been nominated by the Treasury as Postmaster at Lairg, and will in due course be appointed if found to be eligible and qualified, from a Post Office point of view, for the situation. A Memorial on the subject has, I believe, been received, and is under consideration; but the ground on which the Memorialists base their objection to Mr. Munro's appointment, namely, that he is engaged in business of the same kind as that of other merchants in the town, would not, in my opinion, be a sufficient reason for cancelling the nomination.
 *MR. RAIKES : I do not think I am bound so to graduate punishments as to make them fit in with the views which any particular Magistrate may hold. I have to look at the conduct of the men,
 918
 *MR. RAIKES : Really, Sir, I am not aware whether there are any precedents. I hope there are not many. This man's conduct was extremely bad.
 MR. H. GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : I would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether it was not understood when the 12 o'Clock Rule was passed that it should not be suspended save for the purpose of enabling important discussions to be concluded for the convenience of the House; and whether the proposition he makes tonight is for that purpose or merely to enable the Government to continue discussions on Report of Supply to any hour of the morning?
 MR. H. GARDNER : Will the Motion apply to the whole of the present Session?
 MR. H. GARDNER : Then I shall oppose it.
 MR. H. GARDNER : What are we about to do? Is this a proposal for a limited period or for the remainder of the Session?
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether the attention of Her Majesty's Government has been drawn to the numerous delusive or misleading prospectuses and other circulars, emanating from various foreign countries, addressed to intending emigrants, and largely circulated in the United Kingdom, and to the misfortunes which often befall persons who, on the faith of these documents, emigrate to places where they find the advantages they have been led to expect are wholly wanting; whether the Government have considered the possibility of taking means to make better known the substance of the valuable Reports, bearing on the prospects which various foreign countries offer to emigrants, which are received from British Diplomatic and Consular Agents abroad, and to promote the wider diffusion of those publications of the Emigrants' Information Office which are largely based on these Reports; whether, in particular, they have considered, or will consider, whether some summary
 920
(12.0.)  MR. CRAIG  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : I wish to ask two questions in connection with this Vote. The first is, Whether the expenditure on the two light railways which are not yet brought under the Light Railways Act, 1889, can be properly included in a Vote for the year ending the 31st of March, 1891? The other question is, In what clause of what Act does the Secretary to the Treasury find that a light railway means a railway of 5 feet 3 inches gauge?
 *MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I am not aware that any change has been made in the fees of the schools referred to; but the whole of the hon. Member's question arises out of points on which the
 917
 *MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : On Monday.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : I am informed that the two gentlemen named in the question applied for admission before the jury was balloted for, and were refused on account of the Court being then fall. After the ballot, a number of those jurymen who were not required to act, and some other persons, left the Court, and had these two gentlemen presented themselves then at the public entrance they would have been admitted as a matter of course. So far as is known, no one was refused admission except when the Court happened to be full. No orders were issued by the Judge, or any one in authority, for the exclusion of the public; and the officials merely carried out a standing order of the Court, that no greater number of persons be admitted than there is sitting accommodation for. The trial in question excited considerable interest, and the Court was very full during most of the time it lasted.
 MR. J. ROWLANDS : Yes; I did not mean that the silence was absolute; the hon. Member for Chelsea has spoken against the Resolution. The speech we have just listened to is one of the finest examples of the  laisser faire 980 981 982 983
(9.20.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : It is worthy of note that Metropolitan Members on the other side have been silent during this Debate, while one of them has attempted to burke the Debate by moving a count.
 MR. J. STUART : It depends upon the date of the contract.
 MR. J. STUART : I said I did not view it as anything like a complete solution.
*(5.43.)  MR. J. STUART : I wish to-put the right hon. Gentleman's even-mindedness to the test. If it be that this question is still under the consideration of the Committee, and the Government are desirous that this question shall not trouble the House, then will they do what the County Council for two years asked them to do, namely
 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944
(5.25.)  MR. J. STUART  (Shoreditch, Hoxton) : I rise, Sir,
 "To call attention to the unfair incidence of Local Taxation in London and other large towns; and to move, That, in the opinion of this House, the freeholders and owners of ground values in the Metropolis ought to contribute directly a substantial share of Local Taxation."
 MR. J. STUART : They very seldom have the reversion.
 MR. J. STUART : I said that none of the proposals were an adequate solution of the difficulty.
 MR. J. STUART : We suggest that the relief to the Metropolis has been comparatively insufficient.
*(4.15.)  MR. THEOBALD  (Essex; Romford) : The London County Council, having become possessed of this property, appear to be animated by the desire which generally animates other owners of property, namely, to make as much out of it as they can. They are not going, as they compel others to do, to widen the roadway. I think they ought to be required to observe themselves the same rule which they lay down for others. I shall certainly vote for the Amendment.
 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : The right hon. Gentleman says that this Motion has been made for five years, but I think if he will look into the matter he will find it has never been made so early in the Session. I shall, therefore, move as an Amendment words providing that the Motion shall only remain in force until Easter. Let us try it for the next 10 days, and see how it works. The present state of public business is not backward, and there can be no necessity for thus setting aside the Standing Orders in such a sweeping fashion.
 MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : May I ask whether it is to be distinctly understood that the Motion will not be used for allowing Votes to be taken after midnight when discussions on those Votes have, by arrangement, been postponed until the Report stage; and also whether it will be understood that, as soon as the Reportstages of Supply and Ways and Means are disposed of, the business of the House will conclude?
 MR. WHARTON  (York, W.R., Ripon) : I beg to ask the Home Secretary whether he is aware that on Saturday last a charge was brought before the County Bench at Sunderland, composed of 10 Magistrates, of assault against two County Police superintendents—Burrell and Oliver (the former being deputy chief constable); that the hearing lasted till 8.45 p.m.; that the charge was unanimously dismissed by the Bench in Burrell's case, with costs against the prosecutor, Mr. Samuel Storey, M.P., and that the charge against Superintendent Oliver was withdrawn by the prosecutor?
(7.10.)  MR. J. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I admit there is some force in the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman opposite; that it is difficult to discuss this matter with any great amount of interest with the knowledge that the Committee is sitting upstairs to consider the whole
 967 968 969 970 971 972
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture how he proposes to meet the
 922
*(6.20.)  MR. MONTAGU  (Tower Hamlets, Whitechapel) : I rise to second the Motion of my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreditch. I do so in the interests of the working classes and very poor of the Metropolis, a vast number of whom live in the Tower Hamlets, of which I am one of the Representatives. I believe that those classes suffer unjustly through the incidence of local taxation, and that the owners of ground values in London escape unfairly from taking their proper share of local burdens. My experience of nearly 40 years in East London convinces me that personal efforts and private benevolence
 945 946 947
 *MR. MONTAGU : I would prefer ground values; but ground rents would be better than nothing. An objection has been raised to the rating of ground values on the plea that those who have purchased ground rents recently have not the benefit from improvements, and their investments have not increased in value. The reply to that would be that the intention to tax ground rents or ground values has been publicly declared on behalf of a large section of this House, and, therefore, purchasers have had ample notice that such would be the effect of legislation in the near future. Whenever a fresh tax is imposed, some cases, of unequal treatment will arise, but the owners of ground values as a class cannot reasonably object to a moderate tax. In my native town—Liverpool—city lands have been the object of greater regard and foresight than here in London. It appears that the Corporation has owned for many years nearly two-thirds of the parish of Liverpool. The leases granted by the Corporation, of which there are over 5,000, are as a rule sold for 75 years at a peppercorn rent renewal during the term by fines, in consideration of which payment the leases are extended to 75 years. Thus, private landowners are to a great extent excluded from the benefit of unearned increment, and from benefit arising from the expenditure of public money on improvements, all this goes to the ratepayers. Also, if any property is required for public purposes and improvements it can be more easily acquired by such a system. The leaseholders, too, erect more substantial buildings than they do in London. Two years ago and last year I introduced a Bill into
 948 "The object of this Bill is to charge, as in the case of a sewers rate, upon the freehold or inheritance of the land within the Metropolis, the capital sums now due, or hereafter to become due, in respect of loans raised, or hereafter to be raised, with the previous sanction of the Treasury or of the Local Government Board, after full investigation as to the class and nature of the work, and exclusively applied to carrying out permanent improvements." "That nearly the whole of its (the late Metropolitan Board of Works) expenditure and obligations have been incurred for the purpose of supplying wants arising from the defects of former administration of the affairs of the Metropolis, and of effecting permanent improvements, which have tended to increase the value of property in the Metropolis." "Your Committee, therefore, recommend that in any arrangement of the fundamental resources of the Metropolitan Board, a portion of the charge for permanent improvements and works shall be borne by the owners of property within the Metropolis, the rate being in the first instance paid by the occupier, and subsequently deducted from his rent, as is now provided in regard to the General Property Tax." "The machinery by which it is proposed to give effect to this principle of local taxation is to take out of the amounts raised by any Rating Authority in the Metropolis such sum now included therein as represents borrowed capital or annual instalments for its repayment, and to substitute in lieu thereof a Metropolitan improvement rate, to be collected as a fixed charge from the occupier, as in the case of Land Tax. The occupier paying the same shall be entitled to deduct the amount from any rent payable by him to his superior in title, and each successive owner of any interest less than the fee simple shall have this power. All contracts whereby this rate is shifted upon the occupier or the owner of intermediate interest, are declared null and void." 949 950 951 "Freeholders and owners of ground values in the Metropolis ought to contribute directly a substantial share of local taxation."
*(8.43.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : It is not my intention to discuss the Amendment, although I think it is a very sensible one. Person ally I would prefer to meet the Resolution proposed by the hon. Member for Shore-ditch (Mr. Stuart) with a direct negative. The matter is rather one of principle than of detail, and therefore, rather one for the House to settle than for consideration by a Select Committee. The Resolution is—
 "That, in the opinion of this House, the freeholders and owners of ground values in the Metropolis ought to contribute directly a substantial share of Local Taxation." 973 974
 *MR. SYDNEY GEDGE : I am neither bound to know all my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has written, nor am I bound to agree with it. On this side of the House there is plenty of private judgment and liberty of opinion. We do not all tie ourselves to one leader or become Home Rulers, or anything else in a night because a right hon. Gentleman tells us to do so. Therefore, in spite of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer says, I shall venture to hold my own opinion, and to answer the arguments that have been put forward. Possibly the Chancellor of the Exchequer may not hold the same opinion now. It is said that at the time the bargain was made it was not known that the rates would be so high. But who is it that makes the rates so high? The ratepayers. With very few exceptions the rates are voluntary. The ratepayers and not the owners have the power of voting at the election of the Local Authorities, and it is only fair that those who have control over the expenditure should provide for it. It was always known that the rates were not a fixed quantity, and, therefore, I ask why should not the owner make a bargain, that if the rates do increase those who control the expenditure should pay for the increase, instead of the person who for 99 years will get no benefit from the increase. I know it is sometimes alleged that Income Tax is an exception, and that Parliament set the
 975
*(9.3.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  proceeded: The case is simple when a person takes ground from the freeholder at a long lease with the intention of building a house upon it, and giving up the house at the end of the term, and paying a ground rent during the term of the lease; but generally the arrangements are much more complicated, even as between the original freeholder and the lessee builder. This is a very common case. An acre of land is taken under agreement, the builder is willing to pay £100 a year upon it and the arrangement is that he shall build a certain number of houses, the ground rent upon each to bear a fair proportion to the rack rent, so that the ground rent is well secured. Bat the builder often comes to an arrangement with the freeholder by which he erects 10 houses on a quarter of the acre, and apportions £10 a year ground rent on each, leaving three quarters of the acre at a peppercorn ground rent. Then, the £100 being secured on the quarter of the acre the builder goes to the freeholder and says: "If you will allow me, I will build more houses and take a lease of each separately at £10 a year on consideration of which, and to supply me with capital, I will take from you £220 per house. Then the landlord does just what he would do if he put the money in the funds: he pays the builder a fair market price, upon which the ground rents are settled. If he had put this money in the funds he would be free from rates, and upon what possible principle, he having given far more than the original value of the land for the ground rent thus secured, on what possible principle is the State to come upon the ground landlord and insist upon levying an extra tax upon the ground rents for which he has paid the holding tenant? Is the landlord to be taxed simply because his security happens to be in
 976 977 octroi. 978 979
 MR. BUCHANAN : I wish to ask the Lord Advocate when he will introduce his Bill to amend the Presumption of Life Limitation (Scotland) Act?
 MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether his attention has been called to the fact that on the 26th January, at the trial of Robert Smith, Secretary of the Leith Branch of the Amalgamated Seamen's and Firemen's Union, in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, Mr. D. Blackman, delegate of the Edinburgh Trades Council, appointed to watch the proceedings, and Mr. E. Robson, also a member of the Trades Council, were refused admission to the Court during the proceedings;
 915
 MR. BURT  (Morpeth) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether a re-settlement of the Central Provinces has been proceeding during the past three years, and whether as regards some villages the rents have been raised some 40, some 50, and some even 100 per cent.; and whether the Secretary of State will obtain and lay on the Table particulars showing, district by district, in the Nagpur, Chattisgarb, Jubbulpore, and Nerbudda Divisions, the rent at which they were assessed under the old settlement and the rates which it is intended the tenants shall pay under the new settlement?
(5.30.)  MR. W. E. GLADSTONE  (Edinburgh, Mid Lothian) : Sir, had I believed that the hon. Gentleman was introducing an innovation into Parliamentary practice, I should have been much disposed to have joined in the appeal of the right hon. Gentleman. But with very great respect, and undoubtedly with some reserve, because I have had no opportunity of fortifying
 935
*(5.29.)  THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : After what has fallen from the Speaker, I must appeal to the hon. Member opposite not to create a precedent which may be found most inconvenient. I believe that on no occasion within recent Parliamentary history has a subject been debated in this House when it has already been specifically referred to a Select Committee for consideration. A Committee partakes largely of the nature of a jury, it being their duty to examine and weigh evidence for and against a proposal, and to interfere with their deliberations by a Debate in this House can hardly be right. The precedent which the hon. Member opposite wishes to establish would, I fear, result in destroying the authority of Committees of that House, and tend to produce among hon. Members an unwillingness to take part in the work of a tribunal whose deliberations might at any time be interrupted by Debates in the House.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : There are two Bills relating to the subject of Public Health; and as it is very desirable that the law on the subject should be amended, I hope that the Bills will, as soon as possible, be sent before the Standing Committee. One of these Bills contains a great many provisions for the consolidation and amendment of the law; and if a strong disinclination to proceed
 933
*(5.42.) MR. W. H. SMITH : May I say one word on this matter? The right hon. Gentleman appeared to suggest that the Government desired to shelve a question of this kind by referring it to a Committee. We could not, and should not, advise the House that the system of ground rents was one which ought to be absolutely and unconditionally abolished. We hoped the House would be disposed to adopt the view of referring this Motion to a Committee which is already dealing with the subject, and all I desired to do was to represent to the House the inconvenience of discussing the question. So far as the Government are concerned, if it is the desire of the House to proceed with the discussion, we are quite prepared to so.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : In the course of next week.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I have received the Memorial
 925
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Certainly. The Motion does not extend to other business, and I think the experience of the past year will satisfy the right hon. Gentleman that whenever an arrangement is made between the Government Benches and right hon. Gentlemen opposite that an opportunity shall be afforded for discussion on Report staess of Supply, that Report will be taken at a time to allow of such discussion. That has been the practice on both sides.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Certainly.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The Motion is not for the purpose of enabling discussions to be extended to unreasonable hours, but the object is merely to enable Reports of Supply and Ways and Means to be taken after 12 o'clock at night. If the Motion is not carried a Money Bill
 929
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The course I propose is that which the House has taken in the five past Sessions.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope the Lords Amendments to the Tithes Bill will be considered before Easter. When the Bill comes down from the other House I shall be able to speak more positively.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I will undertake that that shall be done.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I had hoped that the House had understood the statement which I made. I cannot go beyond it. On Tuesday, at the Morning Sitting, the Government propose to take the
 932
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : If to-night any hon. Member were to object to our proceeding with Report of Supply or Committee of Ways and Means, those Orders would have to stand over until Monday, and the holidays would be deferred certainly till Thursday, and perhaps until Saturday week.
*(5.1.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : There may possibly be some cases in which an exception should be made, but I have no hesitation in saying that that will be the practical result unless there is any such exception. I am anxious not to enter into any pledge from which at a future day I might be charged with having departed. There may be cases which would fully justify an exception, and I undertake that if I do depart from the understanding I will justify the departure. For instance, there may be a measure like the Seed Potatoes Bill, which it is most desirable to pass through, but with such an understanding my hands would be absolutely tied.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I shall certainly use any influence I possess in the direction of preventing the transacting of any business after 1 o'clock. My desire is to meet the convenience of the House as far as I possibly can. I will consult with the Speaker and the Officers of the House; but from my own experience, I would strongly urge that there should be no change on the present system. It is, no doubt, inconvenient that opportunity should be taken after 1 o'clock to get a stage of a measure. As far as my influence goes, I will certainly discourage anything of that kind in every possible way; but I do not think it will be desirable to alter the Standing Order.
(12.2.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : The House has power to vote monoy for any purpose. It was distinctly stated to the House by my right hon. Friend (Mr. A. J. Balfour) that as regards the expenditure on the two lines referred to—one of which has since been brought under the Act of 1889—the sanction of Parliament had been anticipated. Parliament has, however, been good enough to sanction the provision my right hon. Friend thought it right to make under the circumstances of the case. The hon. Gentleman also asks me about light railways of 5 feet 3 inches gauge. I am afraid I must answer that question by asking him another—namely, whether he can point to any Act, or any clause in any Act, which prohibits a light railway being 5 feet 3 inches gauge? The term "light railway" has no reference to gauge, but refers to the weight which can be carried over the line. As far as I know that is the only definition, and you might if you liked make a light railway with a gauge of 10 feet.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Why?
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I did not say it was a dilatory suggestion.
(5.2.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : It is more with reference to Private than to Government Bills that the Govern-
 931
 SIR W. HARCOURT : What will be the business taken at the Morning Sitting on Tuesday?
(5.40.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : The right hon. Gentleman the First Lord of the Treasury made the observation that a practice of this kind might discourage Members serving on Committees. I may remind the right hon. Gentleman that it has been the practice within the last year or two to dispose of questions by referring them either to a Committee or to a Royal Commission, and such a practice might, have the effect of closing the mouth of this House altogether. If you can only get a question referred to a Royal Commission, you may be sure that for three years the subject will not be heard of further. And if the Government go on pursuing this course of referring everything to Committees or to Royal Commissions, it is conceivable that the House might be dispossessed of such a subject, for instance, as the labour question for years to come.
 SIR ALBERT ROLLIT  (Islington, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that the Inflammable Liquids Bill applies detrimentally to a great number of very important industries which have no connection with the petroleum trade, and that in the opinion of influential representatives of these trades sufficient steps have not been taken in framing the Bill to safeguard the interests of these industries; and whether he is prepared to re-consider the provisions of the Bill on this point?
 *SIR WALTER FOSTER  (Derbyshire, Ilkeston) : I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, considering that the Public Health Bills are so voluminous, and that they were only issued this morning, it would be right to take them, into consideration on Tuesday? We have seldom had an opportunity of discussing important Sanitary Bills at any length, and, therefore, I appeal to the Government not to force them on so soon.
 DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether any change has been made in the fees charged in fee-charging public schools in Glasgow since the Auditor General in December last scheduled four of them, on their own statement of facts, as disqualified, through the amount of fees charged, from participation in the Education Grant; whether any investigation of facts, as repeatedly suggested by the Auditor General, has been made by the Department into the accounts of any of the other fee-charging public schools in Glasgow; and whether the Scotch Education Department contests the opinion expressed by the Auditor General that the ordinary and additional grants to State-aided schools are so far homogeneous that, when a school is ineligible for the ordinary grant, it cannot participate in the additional grant?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India if any Papers will be presented explaining the motives for and the circumstances under which Her Majesty's Government have denounced the Treaties with Portugal regarding the Indian Possessions of the two countries, as notified in the  Gazette
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : Have we now an absolute pledge that no Public Bills will be taken after the hour when, in ordinary circumstances, they cannot be taken if objected to? Will the opponents of Public Bills be able to go home to bed at night without fear that the Bills will be slipped through in their absence on the plea that the Government suddenly came to the conclusion it was an exceptional Bill?
 *A LORD OF THE TREASURY (Sir H. MAXWELL,  Wigton : Yes, Sir; £1,000 has been advanced to the Earl of Courtown for the purpose of repairing the pier, and interest is paid thereon by his Lordship.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : The Goa Treaty of 1878 is considered by the Government of India to have been found in practice a disadvantageous arrangement, and to require alteration in certain of its provisions. At their request instructions were sent to Her Majesty's Minister at Lisbon to denounce the Treaty under the provision contained in its 22nd Article. The Government of India are, however, willing to renew the Treaty on suitable terms, and negotiations will shortly be opened at Lisbon with that object. It is not intended to-present any Papers on the subject at present.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham : The answer to the first question is, Yes. As to the second question, the Secretary of State will call for particulars of the results of re-settlement so far as they have proceeded. None have yet, so far as the Secretary of State is aware, been made in the Nagpur or Nerbudda Divisions. He will consider whether the Papers, when received, can be laid on the Table.
 MR. MAPLE  (Camberwell, Dulwich) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury if he has received a Memorial from the Chairman of the School Board for London, asking that facilities be granted for the passing of the London School Board Elections Bill, now down for Second Reading on Friday the 6th instant, in view of the triennial election which takes place next November; and if the Government are prepared to support the measure?
 Sir JOHN MOWBRAY  reported from the Committee of Selection; That they had added to the Standing Committee on Law, and Courts of Justice, and Legal Procedure, the following Fifteen Members in respect of the Penal Servitude Bill, viz.: Mr. Arthur Acland, Mr. Gainsford Bruce, Mr. Coleridge, Mr. W. H. Cross, Mr. Cuninghame Graham, Mr. Alfred Gathorne-Hardy, Mr. Gurdon, Mr. Lawson, Mr. Lloyd-George, Mr. Mount, Mr. H. Fell Pease, Mr. Roche, Mr. Talbot, Mr. Howard Vincent, and Mr. Wharton.
 Sir JOHN MOWBRAY  further reported; That they had discharged the following Members from the Standing Committee on Trade (including Agriculture and Fishing), Shipping and Manufacture: Mr. Rathbone and Sir George Trevelyan; and had appointed in substitution: Mr. Shaw Lefevre, and Mr. Provand.
 SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Stafford, Lichfield) : I beg to second the Amendment.
*(4.0.)  SIR JULIAN GOLDSMID  (St. Pancras, S.) : I have carefully examined the site which is proposed to be dealt with by the Bill, and I confess that I see considerable objections both to the old scheme and to the new one. I have even gone further; and as it is quite impossible for the House to enter fully into the question, I have fortified myself with the opinion of a skilled person. There was a good deal to be said in favour of the original scheme, and a good deal also against it. So also there is a good deal to be said against the County Council's scheme, and a good deal for it. But all these are matters which had better be discussed by a Committee upstairs, seeing that they are technical and professional, and that they require a large amount of local knowledge. I think that my hon. Friend opposite has done good service in calling attention to the manner in which these schemes are promoted. This scheme was originally promoted in 1883, and it has only been

 MR. THEODORE FRY  (Darlington) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will now take steps to allow a rebate of Income Tax to insurers in American companies doing business in this country; and, if not, on what ground he justifies this difference of treatment amongst British taxpayers on whom alone the loss falls?
 SIR T. ESMONDE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies if Le will state what are the relations between the Colonial Office and the Crown Agents for the Colonies; whether the control exercised by the Colonial Office over the Colonial Agents comprehends any division of the profits of the agencies; if so, to what amount, and under what head is it credited to the Imperial Revenue; what are the annual
 913
 SIR T. ESMONDE  (Dublin Co., S.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he is aware that considerable friction exists, and has existed for the past six months, between the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of British Honduras and the Governor of that Colony on a question of taxation; that these unofficial members have resigned their seats in a body, and that the Governor is unable to procure any colonist of standing to fill these vacancies; whether the demand of the colonists for representative government has been embodied in a Petition to the Colonial Office; and whether the Government intend to take action in the matter?
 SIR T. ESMONDE (for Mr. P. J. POWER,  Waterford, E. : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if a Sub-Commission is soon to sit to hear applications for the fixing of judicial rents in the Unions of Kilmacthomas and Waterford; and, if so, about what date; and if not, whether, in view of the number of tenants in those districts anxious to have judicial rents fixed, a Sub-Commission will be sent there?
 MR. L. FRY  (Bristol, N.) (Hants, Petersfield) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury when he expects to be able to make the Motion to nominate the Members of the Select Committee on the Private Bill Procedure (Scotland) Bill?
 *SIR J. GORST : The answer to the first paragraph of the question of the hon. Member is, Yes, and to the second, Yes. The reply to the third paragraph is that the newspaper report of the High Court decision states that the salt was not alleged to be contraband. The answer to the fourth paragraph is that the words quoted occur in the newspaper report. In reply to paragraph five, I have to say that the law will be enforced with discretion, and, if it is found necessary, will be amended. The answer to the last paragraph of the question is that if the hon. Member will consult the Bombay Annual Salt Report he will find there an account of salt prosecutions and the result thereof.
 *SIR J. GORST : No, Sir; I said that the Secretary of State had received no official communication in regard to this trial, but that the words quoted by the hon. Member do appear in the newspaper report.
 *SIR J. GORST : In reply to the first question of the hon. Member, I have to say that the Secretary of State respectfully declines to give the name of the deceased officer. The answer to paragraph 2 is that no such circular can be traced. In regard to paragraph 3, officers are bound to obey general orders unless special circumstances justify a departure. As to paragraph 4, my answer on the 18th of February last was correct; and the reply to the last question of the hon. Member is, that the securities which exist are the vigilance of the Government of India, of the Secretary of State in Council, and of the Imperial Parliament.
 *SIR J. GORST : The answer to the first question is in the negative; the second and third, therefore, fall to the ground. The reply to the fourth question is, that the Secretary of State has no information about Abdul Rasoul's journey from Assirgad to the. Peninsular and Oriental steamer. His passage was paid for him by the Government. In answer to the fifth paragraph of the question, I have to say that the Secretary of State has received no fresh information about Abdul Rasoul; but this answer must not be taken as admitting the conclusion attributed to him in the question. In reply to the sixth paragraph of the question, my answer is that no such communication passed.
 *SIR J. GORST : That is exactly the point on which the Secretary of State has no official information. He does not know how Abdul Rasoul came except that he came by steamer. There is no doubt that Abdul Rasoul did ask to be sent to England.
 *SIR J. GORST : The answer to the first question is that the remissions in 1877–8 were 214,315 rupees. At the end of the year 282,000 rupees were held over uncollected, of which 104,563 rupees were eventually remitted. In reply to the second question, I have to say that the connection between high prices and high death-rate must be a matter of opinion. The high death-rate of 1887–8 was chiefly caused by cholera and fever.
 MR. LAWSON : I beg to ask the hon. Member for Penrith (Mr. J. W. Lowther) whether the Charity Commissioners are aware that the governing body of St. Paul's Schools have not yet carried out Clause 35 (1) of the Scheme under which they are appointed, by having a modern department for about 500 boys; and whether they are aware that the present building and grounds cost nearly £150,000 for 1,000 boys, and were provided to give effect to the provisions of the scheme of this trust and charity—a classical department for about 500 boys, and a modern department for about 500 boys; whether the Charity Commissioners have sanctioned the action of the governing body in acquiring a site of about 4a. 2r. 20p. in West Kensington, Fulham, for erecting a school for 400 girls under the said scheme, before they have provided a modern department, for which the present expensive building was erected; and whether the cost of such site, having no frontage, is £15,250, or nearly £3,300 an acre, whereas building land in Fulham, with frontages, and ripe for building purposes, can be easily obtained for about £1,500 an acre; and whether the Charity Commissioners will intervene to prevent this expenditure of charity money?
 MR. J. W. LOWTHER  (Cumberland, Penrith) : The Charity Commissioners have received complaints that Clause 35 (1) of the Scheme for St. Paul's Schools has not been carried out, and are in communication with the governors on the subject, whose final explanation they have not yet received. The order of priority in which the various schools and departments to be maintained under the scheme are to be established is, by the scheme itself, directed to be such as the governors may deem most expedient. The Commissioners have before them an application from the governors to purchase the site in question, but before sanctioning the purchase they have required to be furnished with satisfactory evidence of the value of the site.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Gentleman is speaking about the conduct of the Foreign Office.
 THE CHAIRMAN : As the hon. Member is now opening a different topic, I would suggest that he should reserve that for another occasion.
 THE CHAIRMAN : If the hon. Member for Glasgow is about to bring forward a matter connected with this Vote he would have precedence.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! I have not discovered yet what connection the remarks of the hon. Member have with this particular item.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member has not pointed to any conduct on the part of Lord Salisbury.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The hon. Member is wandering from the point before the Committee. The Committee is only concerned in the attitude of the Foreign Office in relation to these affairs.
*(11.40.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The Government fully recognise the great importance of the subject introduced
 1162
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : Then I beg the hon. Member's pardon. I would point out that it was necessary to submit the Western Australia Act to the House. In order to repeal an existing Act dealing with the disposition of the land in the colony——
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : There is a material difference between the two cases. In the matter of the Cape, when responsible Government was granted her in 1872, the procedure was precisely similar to that now proposed. The Imperial Parliament was not asked to intervene, and the matter never came before Parliament at all. We know from telegraphic information we have received that the Natal Constitution Bill is on its way here. We do not know the particulars of it, but we have every reason to believe that there are certain points in it with which Her Majesty's Government will be unable to agree. In all probability, when the Bill arrives here it will be referred back to Natal for alteration and revision. Her Majesty's Government, however, do not intend to go back from their consent to grant responsible Government to Natal provided due security is given for the protection of the interests of the coloured people. When those instructions are carried out to the satisfaction of Her Majesty's Government, then, and then only, will the consent of Her Majesty's Government be given to the Bill in question. The hon. Gentleman asks whether, prior to that consent being given, we will lay the Bill before the House. My answer is, No, we will follow the precedent set in the case of the Cape, and if hon. Members are not satisfied with the action of the Government in the matter, they can take us to task in the manner provided for by the forms of the House.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : I cannot pledge myself to present any. The Government will not withdraw their consent to the Bill if the conditions they have laid down in regard to the protection of the coloured population are complied with. I do not think the Committee would wish me to go into the question of the Customs Union at this late hour. I can only say that there is a Convention with regard to Swaziland, under which the Transvaal Government binds itself to certain terms for three years to come. The Union exists between Cape Colony, the Orange Free State and Bechuanaland, and the Government having agreed to
 1164
*(11.53.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : What I said was that such proposals had been made, but no definite decision had been arrived at.
*(11.55.)  BARON H. DE WORMS : I must refer the hon. Member to the answer I have already given. The Bill is not yet in our hands. We may have seen reports about it, but it is obviously impossible for me to discuss the provisions of the measure with the imperfect knowledge at our disposal.
 *BARON H. DE WORMS : I said that Her Majesty's Government have reason to believe that there are certain provisions in the Bill which they will not agree with. I decline to say what those provisions are, or to have them drawn from me by a process of cross-examination.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : A Despatch was, on October 31st last, addressed to Queensland and the other colonies concerned. The Secretary of State is not aware whether any representations have been made to Queensland by the other colonies. It seems hardly worth while to print the Circular Despatch of October 31st, but a copy of it shall be furnished to my hon. Friend.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : My attention has not been drawn to any Petition on the subject of the opium trade signed by Chinese residents of Singapore complaining of the facilities afforded to the trade. In reply to the last question of the hon. Member, I may say that the Excise on opium in Singapore produces more than one-half of the total Revenue of the colony.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if there is any shed or open air shelter in Clonmel, Galway, Kilmainham, or Tullamore Gaols, where prisoners can take the two hours' exercise as required by the Irish Prison Rules?
(9.24)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I should like to ask in what position do we stand towards the Central Government of the Soudan at Khartoum? Bight or nine years ago the Soudanese people of various tribes determined to get rid of Turkish misgovernment. They rose in rebellion, cleared out the Turkish Pashas, and have over since been a self-governing country. The seat of Government has been in Khartoum, and in the Provinces they have had Emirs or Lieutenant Governors. Formerly we had a large trade with the Soudan, and that trade might be revived if Her Majesty's Government came to terms with the  de facto de facto Times de facto
(5.13.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I would point out that the course pursued by the hon. Members of the Government in counting out the House is one which retards Public Business. For four Friday nights I have put down a Motion regarding the grievances of Scotland. On three occasions the House was counted out. If the opportunity had been allowed me I could have dealt with the grievances of Scotland in one night's Sitting and in one speech; whereas I will now have to seek opportunities in Supply, and perhaps be compelled to make 20 speeches and take 20 Divisions. It is the junior Members of the Government who prevent Members coming in after dinner, when they see that there is no chance of getting Supply; and, of course, Members on this side of the House never think of leaving their dinner, or the Smoke Room, or Reading Room, because they expect the Government to keep a House. When you count out the House you will not prevent dull speakers from making speeches on the different Votes in Supply. The business of Supply is lengthened mainly because the Government allow the House to be counted out. Hon. Members must dine, and the half hour taken by the Chairman or Speaker is not sufficient. I think the course which has been adopted is a very unwise one, and prevents fair discussion.
 DR. CLARK : Why should you, before you get the Bill, practically censure the Natal Legislature for its action.
 DR. CLARK : The question regarding the Transvaal is a very important one. If the Convention is put in force and the Transvaal joins the Customs Union, the railway will not pay working expenses, and Natal will probably be made bankrupt. We have not yet heard any reason why British people who have lent money to Natal should have their security taken away from them. It is not that the Transvaal desire it, because they
 1165
(10.52.)  DR. CLARK : After hearing the defence of the Government I am prepared to support the hon. Member for Northampton in his Motion to reduce the salary of the right hon. Gentleman by £200. We shall vote for that Motion in order to express our disapproval of the action of the Government in refusing to come to terms with Portugal, and to delimit our spheres of influence, and also for aiding and abetting the filibusters of the South Africa Company, in taking possession of a portion of Portuguese territory. The right hon. Gentleman does not like the term "filibuster." If he had read the papers of seven or eight years ago

 MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury what has been the number of persons attending the British Museum during the evenings since the trustees opened it to the public; and what has been the average attendance after 6 o'clock p.m. in this and other National Institutions?
*(1.22.)  MR. HOZIER  (Lanarkshire, S.) : I do not suppose that for many a long year any measure has received so great a share of approval as the measure of the Government respecting free education in Scotland, and the best proof of that concurrence of approval is that

 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The General Prisons Board report that the prisons mentioned, in common with others, contain no exercise sheds, the exercise being given in the open air, but sheds are available there for shelter from showers should the necessity arise.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The amount payable from the Constabulary Force Fund to the widow of a pensioner is calculated upon the amount of pay drawn by him while serving, and (except in the case of pensioners who retired before April 1st, 1867) an addition is made in respect of the amount of pension drawn. All officers and men of the Force appointed prior to the Constabulary Act of 1883, are compelled by Statute to subscribe to the fund so long as they are actually serving. Subscription to the fund on the part of a pensioner is voluntary. It is the case that a married member of the Force must, in order to

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have not, as yet, been able to obtain Reports on this question; but in regard to the last paragraph, I have to say that I would strongly advise any Grand Jury to construct the works which they think are required in a county without consulting the action the Government may think it necessary to take.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Careful attention is being paid to the condition of the Gweedore and other districts in the Dunfanaghy Union. Serious injury must undoubtedly result to the Gweedore people if they persist in their refusal to apply for seed potatoes. No
 1070
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The condition of this district is engaging the attention of the Government.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR  said: For the general scheme of railway construction in Ireland the Government are, on the whole, responsible, and primarily, of course, the Irish Government. The work, however, has to be constructed and negotiations carried on with the Board of Works, who are not under the Irish Government. Those are not circumstances which, in the ordinary course, would lead to a successful prosecution of novel and arduous business; but the Board of Works, as a matter of fact, have shown the greatest zeal and energy in carrying out the instructions or recommendations which I have made to them, and not only am I personally, but the public also, under a deep debt of gratitude to the Board of Works for what they have done in the matter.
*(5.40.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : We are fully alive to the dangers which have been pointed out. Undoubtedly there has been laxity in the administration of the fund in the past, but whether this is due to the Irish Government or the Treasury I will not pause to inquire. But the members of the Constabulary Force are in no way responsible for the regulations. They are bound by statute to contribute to this fund. The amount of the gratuities is settled for them, and we are bound in honour to see the transaction is a prudent one. If the transaction is financially rotten the burden should fall on the Government and not on the men. The lesson, however, will not be thrown away on the Irish Government or on the Treasury, and the Committee need be under no apprehension that the evils which have occurred in the administration of the fund in the past will be repeated.
 MR. JEFFREYS  (Hants, Basingstoke) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War, with, reference to the magazine rifle, why it has been decided to abandon the sights invented by Lieutenant Colonel Lewes, and revert to the old barleycorn sights; whether the Lewes sight was adopted because it enables fire to be kept low in the shock of rapid volleys; whether, with this sight, recruits are much more quickly taught to become effective shots; whether the Lewes sights were incorrectly marked, in consequence of having been calculated for the strength of a powder not yet issued; and whether he will therefore have a portion of the Mark II. rifles fitted with Lewes sights, with elevations correctly marked for the ammunition now in use, so that a fair estimate of their value may be obtained?
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! The hon. Member is entitled to complain of a question concerning him being put to the House without proper notice having been given, but he certainly would not be in order in re-trying the case in this House.
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the following facts relating to the case of William Lay cock, recently imprisoned for an alleged poaching offence by Hon. Harbord Harbord, at the North Walsham Petty Sessions; that Laycock was only served at 4 o'clock on a Monday afternoon with the summons requiring him to appear the following morning at 10.30; that, owing to this short interval, he was unable to obtain legal advice or secure the attendance of several witnesses material to his defence, and his application for an adjournment was refused; that the alleged offence was committed in Antingham Wood, which is within the jurisdiction of the Cromer Bench, and not of the North Walsham Bench; that the summons averred that Laycock was, "about the hour of 7," in a certain plantation, the property of Right Hon. Charles, Baron Suffield, which averment was found at the trial to have been altered to the defendant's disadvantage to "10 minutes past 7;" that the Hon. H. Harbord is the agent of Mr. Mundy (lessee of his brother, Lord Suffield), who prosecuted Laycock; and whether, having regard to the above facts, and to the fact that Laycock is an illiterate man, unable to read, he will advise a re-hearing of the case to enable him to be properly advised as to his defence, and to bring all his witnesses into Court?
 MR. CONYBEARE : I am sorry my argument was not quite clear to the hon. Member. Although I must apologise for having gone somewhat more into detail in connection with the case than I intended, I was, at the moment of the interruption, explaining my view—it may be a wrong view—that whereas other Governments look after the commercial interests of their subjects in all parts of the world, our Foreign Office shows a total disregard of the commercial interests of our own fellow countrymen, a fact which tells very seriously against the extension of our commercial interests. That is surely a grievance which we have a right to bring to the notice of the right hon. Gentleman who represents the Foreign Office in this House. In connection with the question of a concession such as that I have mentioned, it is quite obvious that the Government might have brought some gentle persuasive pressure to bear on the Sultan to extend the time allowed for the carrying out of the conditions of the concession. I ask the Government to bestow a little attention to these insignificant details, and if no other argument can be employed to attract the conscience of the Government to this and other kindred subjects, I would humbly submit the possibility of the minds of the constituents of the Under Secretary, who are largely interested from a commercial point of view in undertakings in the East and elsewhere, and especially in Armenia, being awakened to the gravity of the situation in Armenia. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I do not
 1130
(8.10.)  MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I am rather inclined to agree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdeen that these repeated Debates upon Armenian matters are but idle beating of the air and waste of Parliamentary time. But whatever may be the feeling of the Government, we have the consolation of having done our duty by constantly calling the attention of the Government and the country to these matters. I have not the slightest expectation of seeing Her Majesty's Government goaded into any action than their present action; and even if they were induced to use anything more than polite diplomatic language to the Turk, I have not the slightest expectation of seeing it attended with any success. Therefore, while I entirely sympathise with the suggestions which have been made across the Table, I cannot help thinking it will need something far stronger than we are likely to get from Her Majesty's Government before we see any alteration in the attitude of the Turks towards their Armenian subjects. I do not quite agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeen that the difficulty would be met by sending out good Turkish Governors. I do not recollect any case where a Turkish Governor has been sent to quell disturbance and has succeeded. I am not aware of any case where it might not be said of Turkish Governors that evil communications corrupt good manners. In fine, I do not believe you could get a respectable Turkish Governor who would be able to resist the temptation of the gain which wholesale pillage of his unfortunate Armenian subjects would bring to him; and therefore I am inclined to discard, as a practical solution of the difficulty, the proposition that you could find a respectable Turk to go out and bring about good government and general contentment and prosperity in these unfortunate provinces. But to suppose that Her Majesty's Government are in the least serious about this business is absurd. I never knew a time when a Tory Government was serious in bringing any form of coercion to bear upon any people except the Irish. They have always entertained a feeling of affection and respect for the unspeakable

 MR. CONYBEARE : Unspeakable?
(12.42.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will give what we ask. These men, although entered as temporary servants, are not continued as such.
 MR. CONYBEARE : But they are liable to be dismissed at an hour's notice. Although they are temporary clerks they are required to do the work of permanent second class clerks. Some of these temporary clerks have been in the Service 42 years; I believe that, as a matter of fact, 90 per cent. have been in the Service upwards of 20 years. Will the right hon. Gentleman grant a Return showing the number of years these men have been employed? As to the dealing with the recommendations of Heads of Departments, what occurred was that the views of those gentlemen were simply overridden by a few minor officials. I think the hon. Member for Camberwell was perfectly justified in bringing this matter forward.
(10.20.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I am not going to argue in defence of the Chartered Company or of any other company, but I do not think, so far as my observations of the facts have gone, the representations given of them to this House by the hon. Members for Northampton and Kirkcaldy have been accurate. The hon. Member for Northampton admitted that while the Convention was being signed the Portuguese representatives were seized by the agents of the Chartered Company. But if I understand the position correctly, there was a conflict of evidence as to whether Manicaland belonged to the Portuguese or to the company, and that question was being determined by
 1148
 MR. CONYBEARE : I will not go into details of the dispute between the Portuguese and the agents of the Chartered Company. I only wish to ask the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs what is the position of the Government in the matter between the Portuguese and the Chartered Company? I cannot agree with my hon. Friends who have expressed so much admiration of Lord Salisbury's conduct on this or that point. I do not think there is one point on which I can join in admiring
 1149 1150
 MR. CONYBEARE : Abdul Rasoul says that he did not demand an escort. I think it would save the time of the House if the right hon. Gentleman will make inquiry upon these points, because I shall have to repeat the question until I get a satisfactory answer. Will the right, hon. Gentleman do his best to obtain the information?
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India what remissions, if any, were made by the
 1049
 MR. CONYBEARE : I understand that Abdul Rasoul has been interviewed by the authorities of India. If that is so, is the right hon. Gentleman still under the impression whether or not he was escorted from the North-West Provinces to Bombay by the police. Was it not a police escort that brought him down from Assirgad to Bombay; and, if so, I want to know, in spite of any statement to the contrary, whether the Government intend to maintain that Abdul Rasoul came to England at his own express wish, and not against his wish.
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India (1) whether Abdul Rasoul was arrested at Bombay in consequence of communications received from the Indian Office by the Commissioner of Police at Bombay; (2) what action on the part of Rasoul prior to his arrival in Bombay led the India Office to forward instructions for his arrest; (3) for how long a period had Rasoul been an object of suspicion to the India House authorities, and on what grounds was such suspicion based; (4) is it the fact that Rasoul was escorted from the gaol at Assirgad on board the Peninsular and Oriental steamer  Assam 1048
 MR. CONYBEARE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the official, since dead, to whose mistake, in refusing to suspend a part of the Land Revenue in Gurgaon in 1877, he has publicly attributed the losses of human life and cattle during the years 1877 and 1882, and the great indebtedness then incurred, was Mr. Gore Ouseley, then Financial Commissioner of the Punjab; (2) whether, in the year 1877, a circular was issued by the Government of India from Simla, commanding that as large a proportion as might be possible of the revenues were to be collected; (3) whether Mr. Gore Ouseley was bound to obey that Circular; and, if so, why he is to be held more to blame for the disaster than his superior officers; (4) whether he is aware that the prevention of similar mistakes for the future in the

 MR. CONYBEARE : Do I understand that the right hon. Gentleman controverts the accuracy of the report of Mr. Justice Birdwood's statement that the definition of the manufacture of salt in the Act
 "Would apparently convert into crimes some perfectly innocent practices connected with the use of salt for domestic purposes."
 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India (1) whether manufacture of salt is defined in the Bombay Salt Act, under which two native women were recently convicted and punished, to be not merely the preparation of salt for trade purposes, but "every process for the purification or refinement of salt;" (2) is he aware that it is by the process of evaporation over fire, which the Definition Clause of the Act defines to be manufacture, that the dirty bazaar salt is prepared for table use; (3) is he aware that the salt, for the treatment of which by the above process the women were punished, had already paid duty; (4) whether the cases were referred by the District Magistrate to the High Court in order to ascertain if there was any way of escape from the hard and fast definition and prohibition contained in the Act; that Justices Bird wood and Parsons found that there was not; and that Mr. Justice Birdwood declared that the definition of manufacture in the Act
 "Would apparently convert into crimes some perfectly innocent practices connected with the use of salt for domestic purposes;" 1046

 1052
 *MR. RITCHIE : I am afraid that that is a question I cannot answer without notice.
*(12.54)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : The hon. Gentleman asks me three questions. The first is, what is the basis upon which we have settled the financial relations between counties and Quarter Sessions boroughs with regard to main roads. The hon. Gentleman knows that any Quarter Sessions borough which is aggrieved with a decision on the part of the County Council with, regard to main roads within the borough may appeal to the Local Government Board. It is the duty of the Local Government Board, when such an appeal is made to it, to send down an Inspector to examine into the details of the case. The Inspector makes his Report to the Local Government Board, who, on that Report and after taking into consideration all the facts of the case, come to a decision. Then the hon. Gentleman asks on what principles we act. Well, we have to decide as to whether or not particular streets within the borough may be fairly considered to be main roads or not, and whether we shall so vary the order of the County Council as to include a larger mileage of main roads within the borough than the County Council think right. In deciding that question we have to consider whether the street which the borough desires to declare a main road is a street which is mainly used for local traffic, or whether there is a sufficient amount of through traffic to enable us to come to the conclusion that it is a main road. In the Scarborough case, the
 1174
 *MR. RITCHIE : Well I think there was also a short length of street coming from the harbour. The House wilt understand what is the kind of traffic in that case when I say that one statement made in support of the contention that the street should be mained was that something like 55 tons of coal was carried from the harbour outside the borough during the year. We did not consider that was a sufficient reason for making it a main road. Then the hon. Member asked whether coloured plans of these roads could be distributed among Members of this House. I do not think it desirable that that course should be followed. There are very few roads in dispute, and I think, on the whole, we have given satisfaction to the boroughs in the decisions we have-arrived at. I hardly think the House will desire that we should put the counties to the expense of providing coloured plans with regard to matters which are not of more than local interest.
 *MR. RITCHIE : The Instructions to the enumerators require them to take an account, so far as possible, of any persons who may have been in their district during the night of the Census, although they may not have slept in any house. The period of the year makes it very improbable that any large number of houseless persons will be passing the night in the streets on the night in question.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I presume the enumerators will ascertain as far as they can the same information from people in the streets as from people in houses.
 *MR. RITCHIE : The Local Government Board have received appeals under the Local Government Act from nine Quarter Sessions boroughs. They have given their decision in the case of Dover, Carlisle, Grantham, Scarborough and Banbury. With regard to the principles on which the Board base their decisions, and the details of the several decisions at which the Board have arrived, I can only state generally that, before coming to a decision, there has in each case been a local inquiry by one of the Inspectors of the Board, the representatives of the borough and of the county have had full opportunity of submitting at the Inquiry any representations which they deemed necessary, and the decision of the Board has been given after full consideration of the circumstances of each case.
 MR. RITCHIE : No, Sir; there are details into which I cannot enter as to the decision of the Local Government Board. They are reserved for future inquiry, and I do not think it would be convenient that I should state in this House all the decisions we have reserved for future consideration.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I am afraid there is no remedy after the Local Government Board has come to a decision and issued

*(7.5.)  MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton in what he has said about sympathy with misgoverned peoples wherever they are found, but, at the same time, I do not quite understand the tone he has taken in this Debate. The reason why many of us take so strong an interest in this Armenian question is that there exists scarcely any country claiming to be civilised in which such open violence, so much cruelty, and
 1114 1115
*(11.2.)  MR. SCHWANN : I take this opportunity to call the attention of the Foreign Office to the imposition of the Paddy Tax in Ceylon. This has no reference to the Irish question. "Paddy," as some hon. Members will be aware, is rice, and paddy-growers are cultivators of rice-fields. The Paddy Tax presses severely on the poorest class of Cingalese cultivators—a loyal class of peasantry—who have a strong claim upon the consideration of Her Majesty's Government. The Paddy Tax is levied for the support of the general expenses of the Ceylon Government, and it is the only class of agriculture which pays such taxation. A planter may cultivate the cocoa-nut-palm, quinine, coffee, or tea, and no tax is payable thereon. I believe this question concerning the paddy-growers has been before the House on more than one occasion, and I should not have ventured to dwell upon the subject now, but for the fresh evidence which has recently been laid before the Legislative Council of Ceylon
 1155 "Returning to Uva in 1887, after an absence of 17 years, I was quite shocked to see the change in the condition of the people, with which I had been well acquainted. The signs of general poverty were unmistakable, and some of the chiefs, even, with difficulty kept up appearances, while the poorer classes were ill-clothed and in many cases underfed." 1156 1157
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University : A course somewhat similar to that adopted in the case of the last important competition for Government buildings will probably be adopted in that for the South Kensington Museum competition; in that case the judges were for the most part Members of the Government of the Day, chosen for the purpose, and were assisted by professional assessors. Mr. Waterhouse. President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, has undertaken to act as assessor on this occasion. No competing architects have bean invited to visit and

 *MR. BOULNOIS  (Marylebone, E.) : I wish to put a question to the right hon. Gentleman, which arises out of the answer he has just given, namely, whether it does not appear from Dr. Frankland's Report of February that the water supplied to Glasgow and Birmingham during that month was inferior to that usually supplied to those places?
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the relief works are about to be commenced at last in the County Cavan; and whether he will include among those works the roads for which presentments were refused by the Grand Jury, owing to the promise of the Government to start relief works?
(1.30.)  MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I do not wish to offer any opposition to the Motion for adjournment. I only wish to say that the proposition as put forward by the Mover and Seconder of the Resolution, does not meet the requirements of the case. It is not enough that clever boys should be educated free in the higher standards, the proper course is to free all the standards.
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that, on a bill advertising a meeting of Parliamentary electors at Sunbury on the 11th instant and addressed by the honourable Member for the Uxbridge Division of Middlesex, and other Conservative

 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The special grant for the equipment of the Volunteers was intended to complete their equipment with which they were already partially supplied, and not to completely re-equip the Force. As regards the Infantry Volunteers, the articles deficient were taken to be braces, pouch, mess-tin, haversack, water-bottle, and carrier. These it was estimated last year could be obtained for 12s. A rise in prices has since taken place, and the sums are somewhat insufficient. Accordingly, the grant of 12s. will be increased to 15s. for those corps which wear buff, and to 13s. for those whose accoutrements are black or brown. As regards Artillery Corps, they were understood to be already in possession of a waist-belt and pouch, a frog, and a sling. The remaining equipment can, it is known, be obtained for 5s. Consequently it is not intended to increase that amount. Great-coats will, in many cases, be issued in kind, to the advantage of corps concerned. The grant of 30s. sanctioned for all future cases of increase of establishment will be made retrospective to April 1st, 1890.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : It has always been customary to post a sentry in front of certain important Government Offices, and its utility has been proved upon more than one occasion.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The Lewes sight was abandoned at the suggestion of the Committee on the Magazine Rifle after much practical experiment. It was found that the foresight was liable to injury, and difficult to repair if injured. The soldiers preferred the barleycorn sight, and the Naval Authorities distinctly objected to the Lewes. Seeing the importance of uniformity for all Services, and bearing in mind that the Lewes flight gave no decided superiority in firing, it was thought best to revert to the system which had given satisfaction with the Martini-Henry rifle. I am not prepared to go back on this decision.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : My attention has been called to the project of forming a company to establish rifle ranges near Staines, and I have expressed strong approval of the objects of the company.
*(6.2.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : On this Vote I take the opportunity of asking some questions of the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and of calling attention to certain matters relating to the condition of affairs in Armenia. It is within the knowledge of the Committee that a few weeks ago a White Book appeared, giving an account of what has taken place in Armenia during the past year, and I asked the right hon. Gentleman why no Despatches were contained in this White Book dictating or recommending a policy, or making any actual suggestion as to what ought to be done by Sir William White and those under him in Armenia? The reply given me was to the effect that as far back as the 20th January, 1890, a Despatch had been sent from the Foreign Office including certain recommendations, and these were in the nature of standing recommendations, and there was no necessity to send a special Despatch. But I venture to think that if hon. Members will look at this White Book relating to Armenia, they will find in it a record of a state of thing's so serious, a condition of affairs so grave, that it must be matter of surprise that active steps were not taken here in London to bring about a remedy for the grievances of the Armenian population. It cannot be too often brought to our memory that our interest in the affairs of Armenia is not one of a purely sentimental character. We are bound by two distinct Treaty obligations, in the first place, in common with the other signatory European Powers, by the 61st Article of the Berlin Treaty, in which the Porte undertook to carry out certain reforms in Armenia, and to protect the Christian people against the depredations of the Kurds and Circassians, and in the next place we are bound more expressly and more emphatically by the Cyprus Convention of 1878, under which a special obligation
 1100 de mortuis nil nisi bonum status 1101 "In my Despatch dated the 31st January 1890, I alluded to the fact of there being in the gaol at Erzeroum five Armenians awaiting the confirmation of a sentence of exile for life to some portion of the Turkish Empire on a charge of sedition. I have caused inquiry to be made into the case of these persons, and, though it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable information, I learn from various sources, independent one of the other, that the offence of four of the prisoners consisted in having been found in possession of 'national songs,' and that of a fifth, a priest, in having had in his house a history of Armenia published in Venice. These men have been for about two years already in prison. There is good reason to believe that the case of these unfortunate prisoners is no uncommon one. In fact, a high Turkish official informed me that some 30 Armenians, similarly charged and sentenced, had lately been deported from Erzeroum to their respective destinations." "A Mussulman mob attacked unoffending Armenians in the streets of Erzeroum, killing and wounding many, and at the same time pillaging their houses and shops; but up to date no steps of any kind have, to my knowledge, been taken to prosecute the guilty persons." 1102 1103 "The result is that this summer the valley (Alashgird) has again been overrun by the Kurds, who, here as in other parts of Kurdistan, openly declare that their action meets with the approval of the Turkish Government." 1104 1105
 CAPTAIN PENTON  (Finsbury, Central)  I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether, in view of the acknowledged deficiency of rifle ranges accessible to Metropolitan Volunteer Regiments, his attention has been called to the fact that a company has been formed with the object of establishing rifle ranges available for Metropolitan and other corps near Staines, and whether the scheme has his sanction or approval?
*(4.57.)  MR. CAVENDISH BENTINCK  (Whitehaven) : I should not have interfered in this Debate but for an observation made by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian with regard to the obligation of a Government to keep a House on Friday night. I think the right hon. Gentleman has forgotten altogether what manner of man he was some years ago. I remember in days gone by when he was Leader of the House his contention was always the exact reverse, and now I am only too delighted to welcome him as a convert to my own views. It is perfectly true that when the alteration in the Rules of the House was made, whereby Supply was placed at the head of the Paper on Fridays, and the Motion for an Adjournment until Monday was got rid of, it was stated by Lord Palmerston that that would give Members of the House the full rights that they would have on any occasion when Supply was put at the head of the Paper. That was my contention, but it was resisted by the right hon. Gentleman on a memorable occasion, and when a Motion that "Mr. Speaker leave the Chair" had been agreed to, he refused to make the ordinary Motion from the Ministerial Bench that the House should resolve itself into a Committee of Supply. I fought that question with him before your predecessor (Mr. Denison) in the Chair, and he was good enough to decide in my favour, and declare that it was an obligation of the Government on such an occasion to renew the Motion for Supply. Therefore the right hon. Gentleman on that occasion was defeated. When Mr. Speaker Brand was in the Chair the same question again cropped up, and the right hon. Gentleman again refused to renew the Motion that "the House

*(5.42.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I will supply the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton with full details in regard to the assets and liabilities, but he is acquainted with the character of the gentlemen who have been inquiring into these questions, and he may be assured that the Estimates have been very carefully scrutinised.
*(5.32.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I am not surprised at the view which is taken by the right hon. Gentleman. No doubt there have been laches in the past, and while the present Government believe that no obligation has been incurred, past Irish Governments have allowed the idea to grow up in the Force that practically there is an obligation to meet any deficiency. The Force is uneasy with regard to the solvency of the fund, and the unhappy position is this, that while the members of the Force have been encouraged to believe they are safe, Parliament may theoretically, nevertheless, reject the responsibility. I think that would be a very serious thing for Parliament to do. It does not seem to me to be a good suggestion that we should leave the matter open from year to year, neither getting the benefit of freedom from liability nor increasing the confidence of the Force. I must say I think the course we have taken is the soundest course. We are not going to hand over the money, but we are going

 *MR. GOSCHEN : It is a source of regret to the Government that they have not been able to deal with this question. I have this year again been over some of the clauses of the Bill, endeavouring to see whether we can secure the most indispensable conditions without putting into the Bill provisions which would excite opposition, such as we might not eventually be able to overcome, and which would greatly delay the progress of the measure. We will endeavour to pass that Bill whenever we see a reasonable chance of making progress with it.
 MR. GOSCHEN : My appeal for more frequent publication of the accounts of Joint Stock Banks was made without any distinction as to the locality of the banks; but I mainly had the London
 1063
 MR. GOSCHEN : I understand that the London Joint Stock Banks have practically agreed to a monthly publication, subject to their agreeing on the particular form of account.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I understand that that was the recommendation of the Committee, but the country Joint Stock Banks themselves have still to be called together with reference to the final conclusion.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : No, Sir; I have no such object. The question of my hon. Friend assumes an analogy between the deposits in the hands of bankers and those in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners. I should be prepared at the proper time to show the fallacy involved in the view that such an analogy exists.
*(6.26.)  MR. G. LEVESON-GOWER  (Stoke-upon-Trent) : I am sure I shall express the feeling of the House when I say that I share the regret the Government must feel at the decease of Mr. Clifford Lloyd, and that the country has experienced a great loss in being deprived of the ability, zeal, and activity of the late Consul in Armenia. I daresay it will occur to the right hon. Baronet that not so very long ago in one of his speeches, delivered with that verve and sarcastic humour for which the Prime Minister is well known, and upon which not so many years ago he was complimented by Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Salisbury, speaking to the Associated Chambers of Commerce, remarked upon the inutility and undesirability of remonstrating with a Foreign Power except in such cases where we were prepared to back our remonstrance with physical force. I daresay it may appear to the right hon. Baronet that the course we are taking is somewhat inconsistent with that position. For my own part, I think true diplomacy consists in using the eyes and the ears much, the tongue little, and the hands less. But I think my hon. Friend has shown that in the case of Armenia there are special reasons why this country—I do not say should intervene—but should use every effort within our power to induce the Porte to grant a better Government and remove some of the elements of misrule. In the Cyprus Convention there are stipulations that certain reforms shall be introduced, and they are conditions of our assistance for the defence of the Asiatic frontier. Such reforms do not imply a brand new Constitution according to the ideas of Western Europe, but a practical working system of administration suited to the country and the condition of the population under which the people may be secured tolerable good government and protection
 1106 1107 1108 1109 "I am personally of opinion that danger is over for the moment; but a number of Armenians are being arrested by order of the Government, while no steps are being taken towards the prosecution of any of the Mussulman mob who were engaged in the affray of Friday. An extremely bad effect may be caused by this action, and fanaticism may be thereby encouraged." "In connection with the events of the 20th June here, a few more Christians have been arrested, making a total of 24 now in custody. No Mussulmans have yet been arrested for the murder and pillage of the Christians on that day." 1110 "In this country an Armenian family may be reckoned as consisting of at least seven persons, which would indicate that arrangements have been concluded for the emigration of from 4,000 to 4,500 persons. The Turkish Government, however, sustains its prohibition." "The poverty among these people and the Christian inhabitants of the adjoining districts is stated to be very great. Their lamentable condition seems to result from, on the one hand, the heavy, and in some respects unjust, taxation imposed by the Government, and levied without consideration by subordinate officials, and on the other, from the exactions and ravages of the neighbouring Kurds." "I have ascertained the following respecting the immigration of the Circassians from the Caucasus. It would seem that the number reaches 50,000; that the Russian Government has made no objection to the departure of these people who are looked upon as rather a disorderly population." "I understand that the immigration is dictated in a great measure by fanatical reasons, these people desiring to inhabit a Mussulman country." 1111
*(6.37.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : The right hon. Gentleman has told his story clearly, although he has not given the details my right hon. Friend has asked for. But it is clear from the remarks of the right hon. Gentleman that nobody feels more strongly than he does how unfortunate has been the story of the past. As far as I can see, the concessions that have been made to the Constabulary have been made by the Executive and not under statute. We have been objecting very much to a large liability being laid upon subsequent Parliaments with regard to ships and guns; but in the case of ships and guns, the policy can alter from year to year, and we thought that Parliament ought to have an opportunity of reviewing it. With all respect to my right hon. Friend, I do not see the same objection in this case if we are quite certain that the scale of gratuities, allowances, and rewards, is fixed for ever—at any rate that the maximum is fixed. I think it is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary, that the Secretary for Ireland or the Secretary to the Treasury should speak most positively on this point. Nobody knows better than those who have been at the Irish Office what great pressure is put on the

 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he intends to introduce a new clause into the Savings Bank Bill, by which he will set an example of providing banking reserves in the proportion which he considers necessary, in face of the fact that his liabilities to the public alone for deposits amount to over £112,000,000?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade if he will let the Committee on the Incidence of Light Dues meet, without any longer seeking to bind the ship-owning members to give up their conviction that light dues should fall on the Consolidated Fund, in accordance with the recommendation of Select Committees of this House?
 MR. ATKINSON : May I ask whether the country banks have not unanimously decided for a three-monthly publication?
(10.34.)  MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : It would be very amusing if it were not so sad to hear political pigmies—to hear Members on the other side, one after another, speaking deprecatingly of the policy of a statesman like Lord Salisbury and proposing that his salary should be reduced. The idea of anyone trying to depreciate the foreign policy of the Government by even insinuating that the reduction of the salary of a statesman like Lord Salisbury would have any effect whatever, is too amusing to accept seriously. The Member for Northampton knows perfectly well that if he goes down to the City and inquires there, he will find that the prosperity of this country is founded on the foreign policy of the present Government; and if there is a point that is totally unassailable it is the foreign policy of Lord Salisbury. It is a policy that we are all proud of as Englishmen, and that makes us all the more enjoy every trip we take into every other country, because we know it is such a change from that policy which our friends on the other side would like to have restored. When their leader was in office nobody knew what the foreign policy would be for six months together. Gentlemen on the other side are indulging in constant wearying references to Turkish atrocities. Our friends opposite do not seem to think at all that Turkey was fighting side by side with us not very long ago, and they speak of the "unspeakable Turk" as if the word "unspeakable" did not apply to any offence committed in this country. There are unspeakable wretches in England as well as in Turkey. We hear nothing about the conduct of Russia towards the Jews from those who seem to think that Russia is our best friend. There are offences committed in all countries; and while we ought to use our influence to diminish those offences, we ought not to kick at those who are on friendly terms with us.
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : I expressed that opinion before the Royal Commission was appointed.
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : I am informed that the action of the London banks will rather depend on what the country banks propose to do.
 MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether his proposals for a more frequent publication of the accounts of Joint Stock Banks are confined to the London Banks, or whether they extend to all the Joint Stock Banks in the United Kingdom?
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : We are asked to grant £150,000 to make good a possible deficiency. The Royal Irish Constabulary have their pensions voted direct by Parliament. The amount this year is £305,388, but this fund forms no part of the superannuation fund at all; it is a separate fund called the Police Reward Fund, or the Constabulary Force Fund. It was created originally by fines of the police, and by a reduction of their pay by 10s. per cent. The time has actually not arrived when the fund is insufficient to meet its liabilities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer says that contingency may arise, and yet we are asked, without having a single fact or figure placed before us, to vote this £150,000. I would submit to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Committee that we are, at all events, entitled to know the present condition of the fund. Parliament is entitled to know exactly what are the assets and liabilities of the fund. If there is a deficiency let Parliament annually vote the sum. I think this is a dangerous precedent, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not press the Vote this evening.
(5.44.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : I wish to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Government have any intention of introducing the Bill with regard to superannuation? It was introduced two years ago, but not last year, and, as a Member of the Royal Commission, which took a great deal of pains to see that superannuation should be put on a proper basis, I am anxious that the question should be properly dealt with.
*(5.3.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : Sir, there are two distinct questions: the making of a House on Friday, and the keeping of a House for the Motion that the Speaker leave the Chair, and the point raised in the setting up of Supply a second time. The First Lord of the Treasury said that there was no understood obligation on the part of the Government to set up Supply a second time, and the point which we wish to impress upon him is that the Government should make and keep a House until the Question is disposed of, "That the Speaker leave the Chair." As to the present state of business, I think you cannot point, in the last 10 years, to a 16th of March when the business of the Government was advanced up to this point. Three of the principal measures of the Government have been read a second time. One of the measures

(4.33.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : There is no doubt that so much business is thrown upon the House that it is very difficult to find time for dealing with it. But it has been pointed out by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian that it is possible to overcome this trouble by adopting a system of derogation—a system which has been entirely ignored by the Government. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House is now asking us to give him the time of private Members up to Easter. What for? For a number of small Bills; and yet the right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that he is very much behindhand in the matter of Supply. Why does he not attempt to put forward Supply? Simply because he is now doing what, with all respect to him, I must say he always does do—he is making a muddle of the business of the House. ["Oh!"] Hon. Gentlemen opposite cry "Oh!" Possibly they have not had the experience of former Sessions. Well, I am content to take the experience of this Session alone. We were told in the Queen's Speech that there was to be a Tithes Bill, a Land Bill for Ireland, a Free Education Bill, and a Small Holdings Bill. I imagine that the Free Education Bill and the Small Holdings Bill have entirely disappeared from the Government programme. Certainly, the right hon. Gentleman said nothing about them. He said he wished to Prorogue the House in July. Up to the present time we have passed the Tithes Bill through its various stages in this House and have sent it to the Lords. The Irish Land Bill has been read a second time, and various other measures have been carried.
 1076 1077 1078
(5.43.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : It seems to me very astonishing that there is not a single Irish Member in the House when this Vote is being discussed. We have frequently to complain that we are persistently

(6.56.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : Wherever there is misgovernment my sympathies are with the misgoverned. My sympathies are with the oppressed in China, Africa, Turkey, but I have never yet been able to understand why hon. Gentlemen have such a peculiar, special, and sentimental affection for the Armenians. The Armenians are not one atom worse off than the Christians in the European provinces of Turkey. Wherever the Turk is, there must be the grossest misgovernment. The fact of Turkish misgovernment is as old as the Turkish Empire itself, yet, whenever it has been thought advisable by other Powers to clear
 1112 quid pro quo 1113
(5.59.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : Evidently a Tory Minister has done one good service, because he has saved his country from paying a pension to the hon. Gentleman opposite, who apparently has done very well without it. But the Secretary to the Treasury did not answer my question, namely, why these pensions are not paid by the colonies. I can only repeat my contention that they are a portion of the salary which the colonies are called upon to pay.
(5.47.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I would ask the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he could not bring in some Bill throwing the burden of pensions for ex-Governors upon the colonies? At present, while it is laid down as a principle that we are not to pay the salaries of the Governors of most of our colonies, we are called upon to pay for

(9.5.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I see that the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary has not yet returned to his place. He has, however, left three despatch boxes on the Treasury Bench. One I suppose he has exhausted, because it is no doubt the Ottoman box. The two others are, I suppose, the Tokar box and the Manica box. I shall finish by moving the reduction of the Vote by £100, in regard to the salary of the Secretary for Foreign. Affairs. I have spoken of this matter frequently in the House, and I shall probably speak of it frequently again, because I think it is a question of paramount importance, and I am surprised that the House of Commons and the country are not fully awake to the dangers we are incurring. I should like to know where the Nonconformist conscience is. It appears that that very sensitive membrane can only take in one Commandment at a time; and it does not seem particularly ready to take in the Commandment, "Thou shalt not commit murder." In 1884, when the Dervishes were attacked in the Soudan, the Nonconformist conscience was aroused. Since then worse things have been committed, and yet no strong feeling has been aroused in the country about them, though the awakening will no doubt come. At that time it was asserted, rightly or wrongly, that Suakin

 MR. LABOUCHERE : Very likely. When their houses had been burnt down, and their wives and families had been slaughtered, they said, "You take care of us now." I want to know why the Egyptians went amongst these people? There is such a thing as International Law, and I ask whether, under that law, the Egyptians were justified in what they did? Did the country belong to them? If not, why did they go there and take prisoners and issue a Proclamation of Amnesty? All this was done with the consent of Her Majesty's Government. The real responsibility for these acts rests, not on the dummies in. Egypt, but upon Her Majesty's Government. Unless a definite stand is made against these expeditions into the Soudan, the Egyptian Government will proceed further and further—urging, next, that it is necessary to the security of Tokar that Kassala should be taken, though it

 MR. LABOUCHERE : They were wise in that respect; but a certain number of people were taken prisoners, and they were detained. Did these people prefer remaining in prison to going home?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : What does that mean? Does it mean that they were to leave this Province of Tokar and go back to Khartoum?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I am coming to that. Instead of protesting against this conduct, and telling the filibusterers that he will not give them any sort of protection, he appears, from the answers given to questions in this House, always to say that he has no knowledge of the matters complained of. He evidently does not want to hear anything against them. When we ask the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs "Has it come to your knowledge that certain facts which are known to everybody have occurred?" he replies, "We have received no sort of information." Now, Lord Salisbury is responsible for the acts of his subordinates. We ought not to be put off in this way. It shows me that Lord Salisbury is acting with this Chartered Company: he knows Portugal is a weak Power, and he is encouraging and abetting this company in attacking Portugal, enabling them to deport and put in prison Portuguese officials and those who send arms and ammunition through Portuguese territory contrary to Portuguese law. Under these circumstances, I do think that, before we agree to the salary which is proposed to be voted to Lord Salisbury, we should hear some explanation from the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in regard to the position Her Majesty's Government have taken up in respect to these filibusterers.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I am finding fault with the conduct of Lord Salisbury, and moving a reduction of his salary as a sort of penal action in condemnation of his conduct. I believe that this is the usual way of proceeding.

 MR. LABOUCHERE : What was the date of that force coming down the Nile?
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I beg to ask whether the Lower Limpopo traverses territory admitted to be Portuguese; whether, by the laws of the Portuguese Province of Mozambique, through which lower river flows, no vessel may import arms or ammunition, either into the Province or through the Province to the interior, without a licence; whether the  Countess of Carnarvon

I wish to obtain from the right hon. Gentleman some information in explanation of what has taken place. The operations of this Chartered Company are limited by the charter to Mashonaland and Matabeleland. By the proposed Treaty with Portugal, Manicaland was recognised as part and parcel of the Portuguese territory. By the Convention which was signed last August, after the Treaty fell through, it was agreed that the  status quo status quo Times 1144 Times 1145
(11.38.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : As it is now nearly a quarter to 12 o'clock, I will postpone to a more favourable opportunity some criticisms I had intended to make with regard to the connection of the Government with the South Africa Company, than which a more scandalous financial company never existed since the days of the South Sea Bubble. The Government have encouraged unfortunate widows of clergymen and orphans to provide resources for this bogus company, and that adds another to the many reasons why it will be necessary to deprive this country of the glory of being governed by the present Administration at the next General Election.

 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Commissioner of Police that there are in all 20 clubs, established for various objects, in the Whitechapel district, but it is not within the knowledge of the police that these are bogus clubs. It has, however, come to the knowledge of the police that intoxicating liquor was being sold at private houses in this district, and special observation has been kept, with the result that proceedings were taken during the past year against 15 persons for illegally selling intoxicating liquors, and convictions followed. In addition to this, 26 persons who were found on such premises were summoned and convicted. I have called the attention of the Commissioner to the hon. Member's question; but I have no reason to believe that the police are otherwise than vigilant in the exercise of this particular duty.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The Vice Chairman on the occasion in question is abroad, so that I have not been able to obtain the information from him; but I am informed by the chief constable that one of the members of the Committee made some remarks on the conduct of some of the policemen at Silksworth, referring to a quarrel between three constables in their lodgings. The reply given was that, this being a question of discipline, it had already been disposed of by the chief constable. The conduct of the police in relation to the strike at Silksworth was in no way impugned. Some further questions were also asked and answered as to the number, lodging, and expense of the police at Silksworth.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : Yes, Sir; this case was considered by me in 1888, and I then decided that the sentence might be treated as one of seven years, which will allow of the convict's release, if his conduct is good, after five years and five months. Though the embezzlements were petty, they were extensive and systematic, and the man's record was a bad one, he having been four times previously convicted—once of forgery, when he was sentenced to five years' penal servitude.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to say that I am aware that no such meeting as he mentions was addressed by the hon. Member for Uxbridge Division and other Conservative Members, and that in matter of fact no such meeting took place at all. The Sub-Postmaster of Sunbury Common assures me that his name was inserted in the Bill to which the hon. Member refers without his knowledge or consent. The Bill was not exhibited in the Post Office, but in the Sub-Postmaster's shop.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : I quite appreciate the inconvenience to which the hon. Member calls attention. But the postal service in the locality is already carried on at a heavy loss, and I should scarcely be warranted in effecting improvements at still further outlay. If the persons immediately concerned would arrange to have their letters taken charge of at a house within the official delivery, some, at least, of the inconvenience now felt would be remedied.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am not aware of such a promise as that alluded to by the hon. Member. In July last I promulgated the scheme sanctioned by the Treasury, which changed the annual increment of second class male telegraphists throughout the Post Office Service from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a week. In order to do this it was necessary to fix a common date from which the new scale giving the new increment should commence, and to adjust the sums payable under the old system up to that date. I believe that in some few instances this

 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S:)  I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in recommending to Her Majesty the names of persons to be appointed on the proposed Labour Commission, the Government will consider the desirability of placing on the Commission one or more women, having regard both to the large extent to which working women and their trade organisations are interested in any amendments of the laws relating to labour which may be suggested, and also to the fact that some of the questions likely to be dealt with by the Commission affect working women and children in a special and peculiar way?
 MR. BRYCE : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether his answer must be regarded as final, or whether it will be of any use to bring before the Government further evidence in the matter?
 MR. BRYCE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government are in a position to give the House any information,
 1071
 MR. BRYCE : But they are. I hold in my hand a letter from Mrs. Bishop, whose authority is unquestionable. She says—
 "My own caravan was attacked by Kurds armed with the Martini-Henry rifle, as most of them are." 1126 non possumus 1127
(7.40.)  MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : The right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in his observations, suggested that this was a matter which had frequently been before the House, and so it is, for it seems always to be the same story on the one hand and the same reply on the other. The right hon. Gentleman never tells us more than that he has reason to believe an improvement is taking place. But I fear that the Under Secretary does not appreciate the gravity of the new features which have arisen in this question. He endeavoured to make the House believe that things are improving, but the Blue Book of January last shows that the state of things has, in some respects, become graver. Of course, we do not know if he has other information with more recent Despatches. In the first place, there is a disposition on the part of the Christian Armenians to emigrate into Russian and Persian territory. That is conclusive proof of the miseries under
 1121
 MR. BRYCE : I accept those words for what they are worth; but I must observe that the right hon. Gentleman directed his whole speech, as he usually does, to an endeavour partly to deny and partly to extenuate, palliate, and excuse the atrocities which are perpetrated by the Kurds. The burden of his song has always been, "You are exaggerating;
 1122 "It is admitted by every one that a change is necessary in the system of government now being applied to the Christian population of Kurdistan,  i.e 1123 "The result is that this summer the valley has been again overrun by the Kurds, who here, as in other parts of Kurdistan, openly declare that their action meets with the approval of the Turkish Government." gravamen sub rosâ "The third cause is the inequality of justice and consideration shown to the Christian inhabitants of this country, both by the Executive Government and by the Law Officers. This is well known to everyone conversant with the condition of Kurdistan, but, as an instance, I may mention the fact that in all crimes of violence of which the Christians have been the victims during the past year in the Province of Erzeroum no one has been punished, nor, with very few exceptions, has any effort been even made to bring the offenders to justice." "Whatever other reforms may be desirable, they are not of the same pressing necessity as immediate measures for the protection of the lives and properties of the people. The agricultural portion of the Armenian people plead not as rebels, but as subjects of His Majesty the Sultan, for this protection; but in the words of the Note presented 10 years ago to the Sublime Porte on this same subject, the Local Government at Erzeroum seems 'to refuse to recognise the degree of anarchy which exists' in this Province, or the gravity of a state of things which, if permitted to continue, would, in all probability, lead to the destruction of the Christian population of vast districts.'" 1124 "At present, as your Excellency is aware, the Kurds are armed and the Christian peasants unarmed and helpless, the latter sow and the former appropriate the harvest to their own wants, while to gratify their instincts they often burn and destroy what they do not appropriate. On the other hand, owing to these circumstances, the peasants get into arrears in the payment of taxes, the collection of which proceeds by arbitrary and sometimes by cruel methods on the part of subordinate officials, and redress in the one case and the other being for various reasons refused or withheld, the Christian peasants are reduced to a state of abject poverty, fear, and discontent. Any combination for the purpose of petitioning the Government for assistance and consideration is met by the application of those measures only excusable in the case of a people plotting revolution. This the Armenian people in this country are far from contemplating. There are undoubtedly young and indiscreet persons to be found here, as elsewhere, who at times act imprudently, but my observation and information lead me to the belief, held also by all those whose local experience constitutes them authorities on the point, that if the Christian peasants were adequately secured against the attacks and ravages of the Kurds they would be as contented and loyal as they are naturally industrious." "As rumours have been spread again of late of the growth of seditious sentiments among Armenians, I take this occasion of once more submitting most respectfully my private opinion that no real revolutionary feeling exists in either Bitlis or Van. The general loyalty of the Armenian community is perfectly sound, and if efficient protection were afforded to the Christian agricultural population throughout the districts, combined with something more than a mere perfunctory display, or rather semblance, of executing justice, I venture to think that the cause of many well-founded complaints would be removed." 1125
(5.15.)  MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : Will the right hon. Gentleman tell me whether the Civil Service Estimates will be taken first after Easter? There are several Motions down with regard to the Diplomatic Service of the Foreign Office, and we could hardly have a satisfactory discussion on the first day after the holidays. With regard to the suggestion thrown out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham in reference to the method adopted by the House of Representatives at Washington, I venture to suggest that it would only have

 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he has considered the deep distress prevailing among the numerous small farmers in Kiltullagh and Ballinlough, in the Castlerea Union, County Roscommon; and what measures he proposes in order to afford them relief?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to the condition of a vast proportion of the population of the Gweedore district of Dunfanaghy Union; whether any part of Ireland can show a worse condition than is to be found in the Meenacladdy, Bloodyforeland, and Brinlack portions of this district; what measures he proposes for the relief of this misery; whether his attention has been called to the consequences that must result next year owing to the fact that no seed potatoes have been provided for the Gweedore district, and whether he purposes making provision to prevent the famine that must ensue next year if seed be not promptly provided now; and whether it is by any fault of the Poor Law Guardians of the district that no seed has been provided; and, if so, whether he can compel this Board of Guardians to perform their duty in this crisis, or whether he will take steps to save the people from the consequences of their neglect?
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : The duties of Returning Officers at School Board Elections are prescribed by the General Order of October, 1890, issued by the Scotch Education Department in virtue of the powers conferred on the Department under the Education Acts. Paragraph 20 of that Order provides for the case of an equality of votes. The Returning Officer is also, in pursuance of Paragraph 21, to make a return of the result of the poll and of the names, with place of abode and designation, of the persons elected, which must necessarily be based upon the number of votes obtained by the respective candidates.
 MR. THEOBALD  (Essex, Romford) : I think the grievance of these writers is that they are called upon to do the work of second class clerks, but are not placed in the same category as those officials.
 SIR J. COLOMB  (Tower Hamlets, Bow, &c.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies what was the date of the communication, referred to by the Auditor General in his Report on the Imperial Defence Act, addressed by the Colonial Office to the Government of Queensland, respecting the non-ratification of the Australasian Agreement by that Government; whether any remonstrance or representations on this subject have been made to the Government of Queensland by any of the other Australasian Colonies who were parties to and who have ratified the said Agreement; and whether the correspondence will be presented to the House?

 MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether any of the proposals contained in the Treasury Minute of 15th July last have yet been carried out as to the commuting by cash payments the pensions named therein; if so, will he state what payments have been made?
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether the system of appointing persons to posts on the Civil Service, to be paid out of allowances for clerical assistance granted to Heads of Departments, is intended to apply to only such posts as should be held by Civil Service Writers, and to cases of meeting emergencies, or whether it is intended to appoint persons, without their having first passed an examination, and the usual inquiries having been made with reference to them by the Civil Service Commissioners, as accountants, and to other staff posts which, according to the recommendations of the Civil Establishments Commission, were to be reserved for the best clerks of the Second Division?
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I rise to Order. I beg to ask you, Sir, whether the hon. Member is speaking to the question before the Committee?
 MR. KELLY : The right hon. Gentleman speaks an if these men work only seven hours a day; but, as I stated last year, men are slaving their lives out in order to earn £150. How much of the money he has referred to was paid for overtime?
(12.50.)  MR. KELLY : Reference has been made to the bonus system. May I point out that until a man has served eight years he gets no bonus, and after that he gets a bonus rising £1 10s. a year until it reaches the maximum of £50. Therefore, before he is entitled to the £50 bonus he must have served 42 years.
 MR. KELLY : I am aware that since reading the Report of the Royal Commission the right hon. Gentleman must have altered his opinions. Perhaps he will tell us the origin of the paragraph which specially deals with the question. Who are the writers? They are a body of men who are supposed to be employed on temporary service in the public offices and had to submit themselves to a certain examination—not a severe one, I admit—but still hard enough to permit of only 310 out of 1,280 passing-in 1881. What is the character of their work? They do work of the same description as that of the Second Division clerks, and they even teach the Lower Division clerks to do the work on which they are employed. Their pay is practically 10d. an hour, fixed on the supposition that the work of these writers shall be purely mechanical in its character. I am quite aware that I shall be corrected now, as last year, when I said that the great majority of these writers do not earn £100 a year. The right hon. Gentleman said they earned £150, but he was misinformed. I have no hesitation in repeating that the average income is less than £100. Many of those writers have been employed for 15 years in the same office. It has been admitted that a considerable proportion of them do work which it was never intended to be done by them. Previous to 1870 the heads of Departments had the power, and exercised it in every instance, of recommending

 MR. KELLY : I spoke amidst constant interruptions last year on this subject.
 MR. KELLY : I had no option in the matter.
 MR. KELLY : I said that a certain number received 1s. an hour.
(12.0.)  MR. KELLY : I wish to call attention to the position of a certain class of public servants known as Civil Service writers. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton on the 21st June, 1886, said there was a strong grievance in the case of the writers.
 MR. SHIRESS WILL  (Montrose, &c.)  I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether in view of the triennial elections of School Boards in Scotland now commencing, he can give the House any information as to the duties of returning officers at such elections; whether, looking to Section 53 of "The Elections (Scotland) Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act, 1890," repealing the 14th section of "The Elementary Education (Scotland) Act, 1872," it is now the duty of the returning officer (or of any and what other authority) at such elections, in every case of equality of votes, to determine which candidate is to be deemed
 1065
(4.52.)  MR. J. CHAMBERLAIN  (Birmingham, W.) : The hon. Member for Northampton made a proposition which is worthy of a little more consideration than has been given to it. The hon. Member suggested for the block of business in the House a remedy which is sometimes proposed by Railway Directors when there is a block on the railway. They sometimes proposed a double line, one for goods traffic and the other for passengers. The hon. Member for Northampton suggests that the Government business should go on the ordinary lines, but that a new line in the shape of Morning Sittings on Tuesdays and Fridays should be created in order to enable hon. Members to discuss Supply to their hearts' content. He pointed out that under these circumstances there would be no obstruction, since delay with the Estimates would not affect the ordinary business of the Government. But I think the hon. Gentleman will see that if the plan he suggests were adopted, it would take from the Government a great deal of their present responsibility and control with regard to the Estimates, because to establish the practice of taking Supply at Morning Sittings would be something equivalent to the course of business in Grand Committees. It has been found impossible for the Grand Committees to be conducted on Party lines, and for the Government to be certain of a majority, and consequently, if this were applied to Supply, the Government would have to consider themselves discharged from responsibility for this important business. I should like to know what would happen if, on some occasion when an hon. Member should find himself in a temporary majority in the Committee of Supply on Tuesday or Friday, the hon. Member were to get up and propose to diminish the Army by 30,000 troops? Supposing a proposition of this kind were carried, what would be the position of the Government of the day—unless, indeed, the hon. Member for Northampton accompanies his proposition by a further suggestion that the Government shall have the right to re-introduce any Vote on the occasion of the Report to the House. Let the House consider the position in which we find ourselves.

 MR. J. CHAMBERLAIN  (Birmingham, W.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade if his attention has been called to the illegal shipment of incompetent seamen as A.B.'s at the Port of Cardiff, as appears from the statement of R. Phillips and other's, reported in the  South Wales Daily News
 MR. ROWNTREE  (Scarborough) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board how many and which Quarter Sessions boroughs have appealed to the Local Government Board (under "The Local Government Act, 1888," sections 35 and 38) from decisions of the County Council with respect to the

 MR. ROWNTREE : The right hon. Gentleman has not answered the last paragraph of the question.
 MR. ROWNTREE : I will call attention to this matter on the Estimates.
 MR. ROWNTREE : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether it is correct, as stated by Mr. Roberts, Secretary to the East London Licensed Victuallers' and Beersellers' Association, in a letter to the  Morning Advertiser "Abounds in she beens and bogus clubs where intoxicating liquors (generally of a most inferior quality) may be obtained at all hours;"
 MR. ROWNTREE : Persons feeling themselves aggrieved can have recourse to a local inquiry, and in that case would it be inconvenient for the Local Government Board to give reasons for their decision. If so, what remedy can the right hon. Gentleman suggest?
*(12.53.)  MR. ROWNTREE  (Scarborough) : I shall not now enter at length into the subject of which I gave notice early in the evening; but in view of a future opportunity, when it can be adequately discussed, I wish to ask the President of the Local Government Board three questions. In the first place, why Quarter Session Boroughs are to be denied the reasons for the decision of the Local Government Board on their cases, whilst the Royal Commissioners, who were adjusting similar differences
 1173
 MR. ROWNTREE : That is a mistake.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The Committee to which the hon. Member refers was instituted on the suggestion that a Committee on which the shipping interest should be represented should be appointed to consider the incidence of the present system of light dues and the possibility of substituting a tax on shipping for them. If the shipowners insist, as I understand they do, on the justice of these matters being paid for out of the Consolidated Fund, I do not see that such a Committee would serve any useful purpose.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : Yes, Sir; my attention has been called to the statements in the question, which are substantially accurate. I am, however, informed that prosecutions were instituted against those persons who supplied the seamen illegally, and that, in two cases, convictions were obtained.
 MR. NEVILLE  (Liverpool, Exchange) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General when his promise of increase of salary to the second class telegraphists, given in July last, is to come into operation in Liverpool; whether such clerks in Liverpool have been ordered to refund payments made to them on the faith of such promise; and whether the increment has already been granted to clerks in some towns; and, if so, why these towns are preferred to Liverpool?
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board what steps will be taken in the coming Census to secure the enumeration of persons in London who will not be returned as having slept in any dwelling house or lodging house, but who may spend the night in the streets or in places not likely to come under the notice of the enumerators?
 MR. CAUSTON : What is the nature of the information those persons will be called on to give the enumerators?

 MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether his attention has been drawn to a Petition to Parliament on the subject of the opium trade, signed by over 11,000 Chinese residents of Singapore, wherein they pray of the British Administration

On Friday night the hon. Member for Ripon (Mr. Wharton), whom I have always regarded as a friend, asked a question relating to some private legal proceedings in which I have been engaged at Sunderland. Now, I believe it is unusual, and certainly it would be very inconvenient in many cases if it were the practice, to ask questions in the House concerning the private affairs of other hon. Members. But even if it were the practice, it is only fair that notice of the question should be given in accordance with the practice of the House, so that the Speaker, or the other officials of the House, might have an opportunity of pronouncing whether it was a proper question or not. Still more unusual is

*(5.10.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : I wish to say a few words on behalf of hon. Members who, like myself, have to attend to other work besides that of this House. When I became a Member of this House it met at 4 o'clock. The hour was then brought down to 3, and it is still more inconvenient when 2 o'clock is fixed as the hour of meeting, though that inconvenience may not be felt by hon. Members who come from a distance and leave their business behind them. It is felt, however, by hon. Members who are at home in London and have their ordinary business to attend to. I think the object of the Government might be attained without inconvenience if they met at 3 o'clock on Tuesdays and took Government Business up to 8; the House might adjourn for half an hour as usual, and the evening sitting would commence at 9 and go on until 12. By this plan the Government will have as much time with private Members, only half an hour less than now, and we shall not be kept here until I. There have been five Counts-out this Session, and the Government have been attacked in the newspapers for not

*(5.50.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will also tell us upon what principle these superannuations are granted. I see that an hon. Member of this House (the Member for North Kilkenny) has obtained a pension of £1,000 a year for 20 years' service upon a salary of £5,000; whereas a very distinguished Colonial Governor—Sir Hercules Robinson—perhaps one of our most distinguished Colonial Governors—has, after a service of 35 years, and after receiving a larger salary of £7,000, only been granted a like amount of pension. That seems to me to be somewhat inconsistent. In one case, I admit, the retirement was on the ground of ill-health, and the other on the ground of

 MR. BURT  (Morpeth) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether his attention has been called to the inconvenience caused to Mr. Tweedy, farmer, and others, of Heighly Farm, Morpeth, through the non-delivery of letters; and whether anything can be done to remedy the grievances complained of?
(4.43.)  MR. W. E. GLADSTONE  (Edinburgh, Mid Lothian) : I think the right hon. Gentleman draws rather largely on the pliability of the House, and I was rather amused at the nature of the precedents which the right hon. Gentleman quoted. The right hon. Gentleman did not go back to what took place in earlier years as to morning sittings on Tuesdays and Fridays. All the precedents which the right hon. Gentleman quoted were precedents which he has himself set. In regard to Morning Sittings, as well as in other respects, if the right hon. Gentleman had gone back 10 years he would have found that the Government were then much more moderate in the drafts they made on the patience and the willingness of the House. The strong point in the case of the right hon. Gentleman is that he declares he is animated by a desire to bring about the Prorogation in decent time in the month of July. I hope the month of July does not mean the 31st of July. I am disposed myself to give every reasonable assistance to the right hon. Gentleman. I make the concession to the right hon. Gentleman that I think he was right to a great extent in his contention that the House will derive advantage, in the case of an extensive and complicated measure like the Land Bill, from as much continuity as possible. But there are two things which I missed entirely in the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, and upon which I wish seriously to press him. One is that he did not give any assurance that it is the serious intention of the Government to put forward Supply at an early date
 1079 1080
*(5.17.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : With the permission of the House, I will now reply to the questions that have been addressed to me. I have to thank hon. Members for the extremely valuable and varied advice I have received from them. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian that when the Counts-out took place there was such an obvious want of interest in the subjects before the House that the Counts-out were almost inevitable; but I do not see why hon. Members on the other side should have left the House at that particular time. To ask the Government to keep a House in such circumstance would be to increase against the Government the stringency of the existing Rule to an unreasonable extent. It is the duty of the Government to make a House for the first Motion on going into Supply on Fridays, and that they will continue to do. But it is only reasonable that hon. Members who make Motions should have some support from their own friends. The hon. Member for Caithness indicated that Liberal Members could not be expected to keep a House for Liberal Motions. If that be so, it is rather hard to expect his political opponents to do that which his own friends will not do. As to Supply being in a forward state, that is owing to the fact that, as Easter comes at an unusually early period this year, the Government are under the necessity of getting Supply as early as possible. The Government will certainly do what they can to make a House at 9 o'clock on Friday. As to the complaints about Votes on Account, we took two such Votes last year, one on March 21 and the other on May 23. There is no record in the last 20 years when so few Votes on Account were taken by any Government as by the present Government. I hope to be able to take the Lords' Amendments to the Tithe Bill
 1087
*(4.30.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : In rising to move the Resolution which stands in my name on the Paper, I may say I have heard that great objection has been raised to the Motion. But may I point out that the Parliamentary Session has already extended five weeks longer than is usual at this period of the year? The Motion is necessary in regard to Public Business, and is, therefore, made in the interests of the House and for the convenience of hon. Members, so as to enable the Government to prorogue Parliament many weeks earlier than usual—in July, in fact. Morning Sittings in April are, I may remind hon. Members, not unusual. There were three Morning Sittings in April, 1889; seven in May of the same year; four in April, 1890; and seven in May of that year. I am asking the House to give the Government seven Morning Sittings in the month of April, and this, I think, the circumstances of the case fully justify. The Government propose to proceed with the Irish Land Purchase Bill as the principal business directly after the Easter holidays, and I shall propose to take it on the first Thursday after the House has re-assembled unless some urgent business intervenes. The

 *MR. W. H. SMITH : A strong case should be made out before any attempt is made to revise the Standing Orders of the House. At present I am not prepared to undertake that task.
 *MR. W H. SMITH : I have no doubt that the hon. Member is perfectly accurate in the statement he has made as to the suspension of the Standing Order.
 *MR. W H. SMITH : The Government have come to the conclusion that it would not be right to ask the House to suspend the Standing Order in this case. A great necessity should be made out for the suspension of the Standing Order on Wednesday, as the early rising on that day is a great relief to the strain on hon. Members and the officers of the House.

 MR. WALTER M'LAREN  (Cheshire, Crewe) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether with a view to prevent the waste of time caused by counts out when Private Members' Motions are being discussed, the Government will consider the advisability of asking the House to alter the Standing Orders governing business on Tuesday nights so as to allow Private Members' Bills to take precedence of

 MR. AINSLIE  (Lancashire, N.

 *MR. JACKSON : The total number of persons who have attended the British Museum during the evening since the evening opening was established in February, 1890, is 73,412—average per evening, 264. From February, 1890, to December, 1890, there was an almost unbroken decline from a monthly average per evening of 635 to an average of 90; the average for January and February of this year has been 120 and 160 respectively.
*(5.56.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : The hon. Member for Islington was wrong in stating that there is any difference between a pension in the Civil Service and one in the Colonial Service. A Civil Service pension does not disqualify for a seat in the House of Commons. The Treasury has the power to call up for service again servants who have retired on a pension on account of ill-health. All these pensions are defined by statute; and, as to the case of Sir H. Robinson, he received the highest pension which the statute provides for ex-Colonial Governors.
 *MR. JACKSON : Until the hon. Member or someone else alters the law, the Treasury must continue to pay the pensions of Colonial Governors. The duty is imposed by statute. The hon. Member for Islington will find it most distinctly stated in Acts 32 & 33 Vict that Civil Service pensions do not disqualify for seats in the House of Commons.
*(12.40.)  MR. JACKSON : I cannot undertake to do anything of the kind. It is quite impossible to ascertain how many hours these men worked.
*(12.52.)  MR. JACKSON : The bonus plan was adopted on my suggestion, and I recommended the limit of £50.
 *MR. JACKSON : I think my hon. Friend is aware that in a good many offices I have introduced the system of piece work, by which men are paid not for their time, but according to the amount of work they do. I again say I feel that this question has been thoroughly investigated, and I cannot promise to do more than I have done. It is true that the Heads of Departments did send in a large number of names of men who were recommended for increase of pay, and a Committee was appointed to examine the work of each man so recommended.
 1171
 *MR. JACKSON : Indeed, they are.
 *MR. JACKSON : The hon. Gentleman, then, would have the House believe that very few of these officers get more than 1s. an hour. Taking the day's work at seven hours, at 1s. an hour, the week's wage would be 42s. Let us see what are the real facts. I have obtained from the Civil Service Commissioners a statement showing the earnings of 733 of these clerks, and I think that will modify the judgment and opinions of the hon. Member as to what proportion of the men get 10d. or 1s. an hour. I take it 10d. an hour amounts to £78 a year. Now, according to this Return there were 38 whose earnings were not more than £78 a year; 122 earned between £78 and £90; 156 between £90 and £100; 122 between £100 and £110; 120 between £110 and £120; 64 between £120 and £130; 35 between £130 and £140; 19 between £140 and £150; and 57 over £150 a year.
 *MR. JACKSON : But my hon. Friend will admit that there are times when the House is impatient even when he is addressing it. There are certain rules governing the Civil Service which must be obeyed, and consistently with these rules I am anxious to do what I can for the writers. They enter the Service as temporary servants, and most of them enter at an age when it is perfectly competent for them to enter for the regular examinations of the Civil Service. An additional period of years has even been given them in which to pass the examinations. Parliament has been very strict in insisting that the Civil Service should be entered only by competitive examination; and if the writers cannot pass these examinations the Government would not be right in passing incompetent men into the Service. The question having been so recently inquired into by the Royal Commission to which the hon. Member has referred, it is hardly necessary for the House again to constitute a Committee of Inquiry. I most certainly, so far as I am concerned, cannot undertake to make further inquiries than those I have

 *MR. JACKSON : But my hon. Friend chose a very curious time for bringing forward the subject.
*(12.12.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : I am sorry that my hon. Friend has used as an argument a statement that there is a disposition on the part of the House to treat one class of the Civil Service differently from another. I believe, from my Parliamentary experience, that there is no shadow of foundation for such a statement.
 *MR. JACKSON : Yes, Sir; two of the proposals made in the Minute of July 15 last have been carried out, and payments have been made to the Paymaster General of the Supreme Court  ex parte
 *THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : I think that my hon. Friend will see on consideration that it is not possible for me to give an answer to his question determining what will be the policy of the Treasury in the future; but I shall be quite ready to answer any question of fact in particular cases.
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the case of a man named Edwards, who was sentenced at

 MR. GOURLEY  (Sunderland) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is correct that on the last meeting the two working men who are members of the Joint Committee of the Durham County Council desired to raise a question as to the conduct of the police at Silksworth, and whether the rest of the members rose and left them unable to form a quorum; whether up to date a single person has been arrested, or charged, or summoned by the police for throwing stones, earth, or any other missile on the occasion of the recent baton charge; and how many police were present on that occasion?
*(5.46.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : Under this Vote is an item of £1,000 as a pension for Sir J. P. Hennessy, granted on account of ill-health. I wish to know whether his Excellency is not well enough to resume his duties; whether he is the same person as the hon. Member for Kilkenny; and how it happens that a pension as ex-Governor does not disqualify for a seat in the House of Commons while a pension in the Civil Service does disqualify? Under what statute is the exception made?
*(5.58.)  MR. BARTLEY : I was for over 20 years in the Public Service myself, and when I retired I was told by the Prime Minister of the day that if I had a pension granted to me—which I did not—it would have to be abandoned if I entered the House of Commons. That Prime Minister was a Conservative. I think the general opinion amongst Civil servants is that they cannot retain their pensions and sit in the House of Commons. Surely there ought to be one rule for everyone, and unless I

 MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works when he will be prepared to give the names of the judges and assessor of the South Kensington Museum completion competition; whether he is aware that the plans and elevations supplied to the competing architects contain no drawing or indication of the Central Quadrangle, with its important surrounding façades, which furnish the keynote of the style of the present buildings which the proposed competition is to complete, and whether he would be willing to arrange for all the competing architects to be taken over the present buildings and have the details explained to them, especially the exterior terra cotta enrichments and earthenware mosaics, by the officials of the Board of Works and of the Science and Art Department?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India if it is true, as stated in the  Times "Would be contrary to pledges given in the Imperial Parliament, and could not be accepted;"
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : In regard to the reply of the right hon. Gentleman to the first part of the question, may I point out that the Under Secretary has given me an answer to a question which I did not ask, while he has not answered the question which I did ask? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware, as stated in the  Times
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Is it true, as stated in the  Times
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg to give notice that I will put the question down for to-morrow.
(10.15.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : We are all admirers of Lord Salisbury in matters in which his views coincide with our own. I am an ardent admirer of Lord Salisbury, except in two or three important particulars. The hon. Member for Kilkenny approves Lord Salisbury's policy in Africa, but seems to
 1147
(9.27.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : On the last occasion this subject was under discussion, after an ostentatious and aggressive silence, the right hon. Gentleman opposite wound up by saying we need not trouble ourselves
 1136 Times Times "It is the general opinion in well-informed circles that the capture of Tokar is only part of a larger scheme, as, taken alone, it involves a considerable increase in the Soudan military establishment, and furnishes additional points for attack." "The capture of Tokar may be the first step towards the re-conquest of the Soudan, a measure which is becoming inevitable in consequence of the Italian progress towards the Nile, and is called for to relieve the peaceable inhabitants from the terrible cruelties inflicted under Dervish rule." 1137
(11.59.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : My mind is a great deal relieved by the statement that if the Bill is not considered satisfactory it will have to go back to Natal. If the Government does not give Parliament an opportunity of discussing the question, I hope that opportunity which we can take for ourselves will arise. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the circumstances under which responsible Government was given to the Cape. There are many people who think that is an example to be avoided, and that self government was given in that case without sufficient provision having been made for the interests of this country or for the interests of the natives. In the Cape you have a white population of something like 500,000. In Natal the coloured population out-numbers that of the white people by a great deal more than 10 to 1. I would point out that it is not the Transvaal that insists upon the part of the Convention relating to the Customs Union. The Transvaal would be delighted to get rid of that part of the Convention, the hardship which that State labours under in this respect having been brought to my notice by General Kruger. I should like the right hon. Gentleman to give us some explanation regarding the loan to be guaranteed to Newfoundland. Is the guarantee connected with the arbitration regarding the fisheries; and, if not, what are the circumstances which have led the Government to adopt the very unusual course of offering a guarantee to a particular colony?
(11.15.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : The hon. Member has not moved a reduction, and I am anxious to move the reduction, of which I have given notice, and to narrow the discussion upon the Colonial Vote. There are one or two other questions I should like to ask, though I have no wish to raise serious discussion upon matters which may be more adequately dealt with under the regular Votes in Supply—if we do reach Supply—before the closing days of the Session. With regard to the Paddy Tax, there are complications upon which I shall be glad if the Under Secretary can throw some light, but I must express my entire dissent from the idea that it is not the duty of Ceylon to pay for its own defence. I am very sorry that my hon. Friend should have seemed to express any sympathy with the impudent language—for so I must call it—of colonists who choose to consider the claim for their own defence a rapacious demand from the Home Government. India pays for her own defence, and there is no reason why Ceylon should not assist; and when reference is made to the action of other colonies, all I can say is, two blacks do not make a white. As a fact, Mauritius does pay handsomely for its defence, and so does Singapore and the Straits Settlements. Jamaica does not, but I hope influences will be brought to

 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I said exactly the contrary.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Shall we have the Papers?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I do not dispute the question of law or the necessity of coming to this House. I spoke on the matter of expediency.
*(10.40.)  SIR J. FERGUSSON : The hon. Member for Northampton has called attention to another branch of foreign policy in which, unfortunately, he finds his countrymen again in the wrong. It seems to be his constant view of the conduct of Englishmen all over the world that they are always in the wrong. I confess I begin always with a contrary predisposition. I am inclined to think they are in the right  primâ facie primâ facie modus vivendi 1152
*(9.35.)  SIR J. FERGUSSON : I had hoped that the Debate which took place a fortnight ago on this subject would have sufficed, as on that occasion I replied with considerable fulness to all the arguments which were adduced. On the occasion of a second edition of that Debate, I did not think it necessary to repeat what I had said, but to avoid the criticism to which I was subjected, I will now briefly answer the points which have been again advanced. I am not concerned with the Nonconformist conscience, which was not particularly active when similar but far larger measures were taken by a former Government. The Member for Northampton has referred to declarations made six or seven years ago that the Soudan was abandoned. At that time, when the Egyptian troops were withdrawn from the Soudan excepting the ports on the Red Sea, Her Majesty's Government promised support to Egypt in retaining those possessions. That position has been maintained until the present time; but the Turkish Ambassador pointed out to Her Majesty's Government that the Sultan by no means relinquished his sovereign rights to the territories in that part of Africa, and that neither the Sultan nor the Khedive, his great feudatory, had ever abandoned his right to the Soudan. Consequently he is entirely within his rights in re-occupying that portion of the Soudan which, for special reasons, appears necessary. Her Majesty's Government only consented to the advance of the troops on Tokar, first, on the distinct assurance that there was no intention to proceed further; and, secondly on account of military necessity, caused by the constant annoyance of the Dervishes in the neighbourhood of Suakin. The Dervishes have never ceased their attacks, not merely upon that portion of the Soudan, but even
 1138 status quo
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I said we might hope that these people would be treated kindly if taken prisoners at Tokar, as others had been so well treated on the Nile. They preferred to remain where they were rather than return up the Nile.
 *SIR J FERGUSSON : They remained at large.
*(8.30.)  SIR J. FERGUSSON : I only rise to express my regret that the hon. Member should have allowed himself the use of such terms as he has employed towards a Power and a Sovereign with whom this country is in friendly relations.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I did not say they had been deported to another place, but that they had the choice of going home or staying where they were, and that they preferred to stay where they were.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : It is a word most unsuitable to the occasion. It is very much to be regretted that the hon. Member should have used the expression "unspeakable Turk" as a description
 1131
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : They were certainly not taken by the French Government; but I believe they could not have been taken with the cognisance of the local authorities. There was, however, no actual assault committed, and the mere fact that two merchant steamers anchored in the immediate vicinity of a disabled British steamer affords no real claim for redress.
*(9.58.)  SIR J. FERGUSSON : I regret that I am unable to give the hon. Member any further information than I gave him on a previous occasion in answer to his question. I do not think the hon. Member has made any misstatement of the facts, which are simply these: that a British ship broke down off Algiers, and called for assistance; a French steamer went out to render that assistance; then came a demand for salvage, which the captain did not feel justified in admitting without reference to the owners. Upon this, proceedings were taken without delay in Court, and on the representation that the ship was about to leave the harbour a seizure was made upon her, and steps taken to prevent her going to sea. A week afterwards a tug steamer arrived from England to take her home, where she could be more cheaply repaired than at Algiers; but the vessels of the company which had made the claim took the steps referred to to prevent her going to sea. No doubt the proceeding was very uncourteous and unnecessary, but it was not illegal; and owing to our not having a Consular Convention we could not regard what happened as a breach of Treaty. In fact, we have no grounds whatever for making formal representations on the subject to the French Government, there having been no actual breach of the law.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : It was in 1890. The Member for Northampton wishes to know what attempts have been made to establish diplomatic relations with what he calls the Central Government in the Soudan. For my own part, I do not know that there is a Central Government established there. It is impossible to establish diplomatic relations with a person who about twice a year sends messengers down the Nile to warn all concerned, including the British General and Her Majesty herself, that unless they conform to the rule of the Mahdi he will sweep them off the face of the earth. With regard to the telegram in the  Times Times
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : No, I did not deny that. I denied on the authority of the Consuls that they had been armed by the Government with the Martini-Henry rifle.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I do not think the hon. Gentleman is doing me justice, I have always said that I sympathise as much as anyone can with the sufferings of the people.
*(7.10.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : The House will bear in mind that many things have been said on the present occasion that have not been stated for the first time, and I may admit that it is not surprising that in a history so painful in many respects as that of the Turkish Provinces of Asia there should be many gentlemen who pay attention to public affairs, and who take a special interest in these matters, who find it impossible to refrain from calling attention to the subject. At the same time, it is to be regretted that those who have such keen sympathy for the sufferings of the Armenians, and such hatred of misgovernment generally, should have shut their eyes to the efforts that have been, and are being, made to carry out their own wishes, and to the results that have already accrued. I think that while we should all regret and condemn indifference on the part of our officials to misgovernment and outrage, and while, also, we must all sympathise with the oppressed, we should, at the same time, be doing wrong to be indifferent to the efforts Her Majesty's Government are making to obtain a remedy for the evils complained of. With regard to what has been said by hon. Members with reference to the interference of this House, I would ask hon. Members to consider whether the interference of the House of Commons can in this case be exercised for good, first, upon Her Majesty's Government, and then upon the Turkish Government, in stimulating them to efforts to bring about a better state of things in the Armenian Provinces. If such interference is accompanied by denunciation of the Ottoman Government in the Asiatic Provinces, what good result can possibly accrue from advice offered by Her Majesty's Government when, at the same time, the Ottoman Government are able to point to expressions of hon. Members of this House declaring hatred of Turkish rule and denouncing entirely the government of the Turks? I venture to think that the remonstrances that may be fitting and acceptable for us to make ought to be the remonstrances of a friendly Government, and not such as have been suggested.

 MR.

 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham : In answer to the first paragraph of the hon. Member's question, I have to say that the statements made in Parliament by the First Lord of the Treasury regarding the Indian Factory Bill, which are, I presume, referred to in the question, have not formed the subject of communication by the Secretary of State to the Government of India. The answer to the second paragraph is in the affirmative. The reply to the third paragraph is that the presentation of further correspondence will be considered by the Secretary of State as soon as the new Indian Factory Act is received.
 MR. LENG  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he has seen Professor Frankland's Report, stating that during the month of February the water abstracted from the Thames by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand Junction, and Lambeth Companies was, in all cases, of very inferior quality, being polluted by an abnormal amount of vegetable organic matter, that supplied by the Grand Junction Company on the 5th February surpassing in respect of organic impurity any sample of Thames water examined by Professor Frankland during the last quarter of a century, being opalescent from imperfect filtration, and not in a fit state for dietetic use; whether he has further observed that Dr. Koch's process of examination applied to the water supplied in the different Metropolitan districts showed the existence of "microbes" in the respective ratios of Kent 20, New River 74, West Middlesex 104, Chelsea 144, Grand Junction 220, East London 248, Lambeth 284, and Southwark 356; whether the Reports from the Officers of Health show that there is any correspondence between the condition of the water supplied and the amount of sickness in those districts; and whether, if the existence of "microbes" in water for drinking and culinary purposes is found to be pernicious and injurious to the public health, the medical officers of the Local Government Board are able to recommend any effectual method either of extracting or counteracting them?
*(12.49.)  SIR J. PULESTON  (Devonport) : I feel sure the right hon. Gentleman will have no difficulty in giving way to the appeal just made. There can be no question as to the desirability of getting this information. Whatever the right hon. Gentleman may do, the fact remains that the belief has been encouraged that the writers are permanent Civil Servants, and if we recognise this most of the difficulty may be overcome.
*(11.0.)  SIR JULIAN GOLDSMID  (St. Pancras, S.) : I protest against the language used by the hon. Member for Caithness. Mr. Rhodes and other gentlemen who have taken part in colonisation work are no more filibusters than the hon. Member himself. The hon. Member has most unjustifiably endeavoured to prejudge the case which is now in dispute between Portugal and England—a case in which Portugal, I believe, is entirely in the wrong and England in the right—but the hon. Member is not justified by his position as a Member of this House in using language against his own country, and I hope we shall hear no more of such expressions in the House of Commons.
(11.33)  SIR R. LETHBRIDGE  (Kensington, N.) : I wish to suggest in one or two words to the right hon. Gentleman that there really is a true case of hardship in the matter raised by the hon. Member for Manchester, with reference to the imposition of any further tax or burden for military defence on the colonial funds of Ceylon. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said there was a certain amount of rapacity exhibited by colonials in objecting to this payment for their own defence. The hon. Member is evidently not aware of the particular circumstances under which this military expenditure is imposed on the revenues of Ceylon. The chief reason for the imposition of the burden is that Ceylon has to provide for the defence of the great port of Trincomalee, which is not especially a Ceylon port in any degree. It is one of the head-quarters of the Imperial Navy in Indian waters. It is one of the most important ports for our commerce in the world; and it is regarded as a considerable hardship by-all classes of Her Majesty's subjects in Ceylon that they should be called upon to furnish so large a proportion of the funds for the military defence of what is simply a great headquarter station in

 SIR T. ESMONDE  (Dublin Co., S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if the amount payable from the Constabulary Force Fund to the widow of a pensioner is calculated upon the amount of pay drawn by him while serving in the Force, and also upon the amount of pension drawn by him as a pensioner; if he is compelled to subscribe to the fund while serving in the Force; and whether if he does not subscribe when on pension his widow or his children have no claim upon the fund?
(12.38.)  MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : The right hon. Gentleman has given the Committee some valuable information as to the earnings of the "writers, but cannot he follow it up by ascertaining the number of hours worked by each man? If he does, it may turn out that the information he has given is somewhat misleading. From what I have heard, men often have to work far into the night in order to earn £100 or £150 a year, and then the money is hardly earned indeed. If the right hon. Gentleman will promise to get this information I hope the hon. Member for Camberwell will withdraw his Motion.
(12.41.)  MR. CREMER : I do not think it is impossible to get the information. Surely each man knows perfectly well how many hours he works at home, and the right hon. Gentleman can easily obtain the number of hours worked in the office. These men consider, rightly or wrongly, that they have a grievance, and are anxious to get it redressed. I, too, am desirous of getting rid of the feeling of dissatisfaction

 THE MARQUESS OF CARMARTHEN  (Lambeth, Brixton)  had the following question on the Paper:—To ask the Postmaster General whether it is true that he intends to stop the carrying of written communications by the Boy Messengers Company, Limited; and, if so, whether it will be legal for the public to send those communications by Commissionaires, cabs, and private messengers?
 DR. CAMERON : Will any arrangements answering to the electric call system be made?
 THE MARQUESS OF CARMARTHEN : Will there be a number of boys always at the service of the public; and will it be necessary to come to Parliament for a Supplementary Vote?
 MR. CHANNING, for Sir WALTER FOSTER  (Derby, Ilkeston) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether King Ja Ja has been removed from St. Vincent to Barbados; whether his servants refused to accompany him, and consequently caused him great inconvenience and annoyance; whether his wife also declined to be transported to Barbados; and whether, considering that it: is now some seven months since he was informed that it was Her Majesty's gracious will and pleasure to order his release and re-conveyance to Opobo, he can fix a date for his return to his own country?
 MR. CHAINING : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the questions of co-partnership and profit-sharing will be included in the scope of the Reference to the Royal Commission on Labour?
 MR. J. LOWTHER  (Kent, Thanet) : Will it be the first Order?
 SIR R. WEBSTER : I think the hon. and learned Gentleman is under a mistake. He asked me if it was important the Bill should come on, and I told him I must take it whenever I could. I hope he will not press his Motion.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It would be more convenient if the hon. and learned Gentleman withdrew his Motion and allowed Clause l, which is purely formal, to be passed.

(2.20.)  MR. JAMES  (Gateshead) : I beg to move as an Amendment—
 "That, having regard to the extreme importance of open spaces in crowded cities, this House is not prepared to entertain a measure which involves interference with a considerable area of open space in London." 1200 1201 "The suburb of St. John's Wood is on a slope which was formerly the property of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John. Some 350 acres known as the St. John's Wood Estate have now been for some considerable time owned by the Eyre family, by whom this large extent of land has been leased out in plots for the erection of residences. This Estate, which adjoins the western extremity of Regent's Park and reaches to South Hampstead, has an entirely exceptional character among the residential suburbs of London. The ground landlord under whom the suburb was laid out had ideas beyond the mere question of rent-roll, and exacted the construction of high-class villas, detached and semi-detached, with ample gardens and forecourts, allowing only such terraces of shops as would suffice for the service of the neighbourhood. This ideal of an open neighbourhood has been rigorously enforced up to

(3.10.)  MR. BARNES  (Derbyshire, Chesterfield) : In the County of Derby we are fully alive to the absolute necessity of this Bill. At present we have only one railway, notwithstanding the enormous increase of traffic, and my constituents are of opinion that with one railway their interests are not adequately served; especially so far as the coal traffic is concerned. What' they require is a railway which shall enable them to get direct to London and carry their traffic south of London. I was somewhat astonished to hear the views of the hon. Member for Marylebone (Mr. Boulnois) as to the carrying of coal being an abomination. How are we to go on without coal? How is the industry of the country to be carried on without it? I certainly hope the House will allow the Bill to go before a Select Committee.
(5.50.)  MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : As one who knows something about education, and the necessity for secondary education in Scotland, I am by no means sorry that the policy pursued by the Scotch Education Department has brought them into this difficulty. They tried to establish in connection with the education of Scotland a second grade system, under which there would have been odious distinction between classes of scholars attending the schools; and that was the origin of the difficulties in which they now find themselves. I trust that that is a policy which will be abandoned by the Scotch Education Department, and that they will revert to the ancient system which has existed in Scotland for centuries, under which there are no distinctions at all.
(3.50.)  MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I hope the House will allow me to call attention to something more important than the interests of Lord's Cricket Ground, namely, the great industrial importance to the manufacturing districts and the working classes in the Midland Counties of a line of railway direct to London. When the Midland Railway proposed to come to London it was violently opposed by the Great Northern. It was urged that it would displace thousands of the working classes, and that there was no necessity for it at all. I should like to ask any Member of this House now what would be the condition of things in London if the Midland had not come here. All the great railway reforms which have taken place in London have been the result of the Midland coming here: we have secured more rapid and cheaper travelling, and the abolition of second-class carriages.
 MR. MUNDELLA : Yes; and the Midland encountered the most violent opposition on that account. It is only fair to the Midland Railway to say that they have been the pioneers in every

(3.25.)  MR. JEFFREYS  (Hants, Basingstoke) : I object to the Bill on account of its interference with Lord's Cricket Ground, which is the most unique space in London. I am told that the members of Lord's have agreed to it, but there has been no general meeting on the subject, and every cricketer and every member of Lord's that I have spoken to has objected to it very strongly. They do so because they are convinced that if there is a great terminus built on the other side of Lord's, the company will not be content with two tubes under the ground, but will presently want the greater part of the space.

 MR. CONYBEARE : I have no objection to that course; my Amendment does not apply to Clause 1.
 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I beg to move, Sir, that you report Progress, and ask leave to sit again. I had no idea the Bill would come on this afternoon. I am indebted to the Attorney General for his courtesy the other day in suggesting we should arrange when the Bill should be taken. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had given me any intimation he wished to take it this afternoon, I might have been able to come to some arrangement with him. I hope he will defer the Committee till to-morrow.
 MR. CONYBEARE : I had no idea the Bill was likely to come on, and under

 COLONEL HAMBRO  (Dorset, S.) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works if there is any foundation for the statement, made by Major General C. E. Webber, R.E., in a pamphlet which has been sent to Members of Parliament—
 "That Her Majesty's Government has given practical encouragement to the project called the South Kensington and Paddington Subway Tramway."
*(4.35.)  MR. MURDOCH  (Reading) : This is the first time I have heard the terms of the arrangement between the promoters and the committee of Lord's Cricket Ground, but I feel certain that any committee of which the right hon. Member for Bury is a member will have done its best in the interests of Lord's. It is very likely, however, that the committee may not have had their attention called to what may take place in the future. I cannot help feeling that in the immediate future it will be found necessary to widen the approaches of this railway, and that can only be done in the westward, where Lord's Cricket Ground is situated. If it is found absolutely necessary to have better approaches, I am afraid that Parliament would not stand in the way, but would, in the interests of the travelling public, grant the increased accommodation required. Almost every railway in London—the London and South Western, the London and North Western, the Great Northern, and the Midland—have been compelled to widen their approaches. Those who approach the Bill in the interest of Lord's contend that there is no necessity for the railway taking this route at all. If it left the Metropolitan and St. John's

 MR. MURDOCH : The Midland came into London through a very poor district, and it was of advantage to sweep the property away.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : When I intimated to the House my intention of withdrawing the Registration Acceleration Bill I stated that I would consider what other proposal could be made to meet the difficulties in connection with the preparation of the Register. I have given the matter my consideration, with the result that I have had a Bill drawn postponing the elections for County Councils to January 15.
 MR. RITCHIE : Yes.
 MR. RITCHIE : The Local Government Board have been advised by the Law Officers that the expenses referred to in Sub-section 2 of Section 2 of the Allotments Act, 1887, include the interest payable upon the purchase-money, but not the annual instalments of principal or payments to a sinking fund in cases where lands has been acquired by means of a loan repayable by instalments.
 *MR. RITCHIE : As regards a county bridge, under ordinary circumstances a Highway Authority would not be empowered to contribute towards the construction, or maintenance of such a bridge. Where, however, an entirely new structure is proposed, it might be practicable, under certain circumstances, to adopt the principle of joint contribution by the Highway Authority building the bridge and the County Council contributing to the cost under Section 22 of the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878. With regard to a main road, I do not think there is any way in which a Highway Authority can directly contribute towards the cost of the improvement of a main road. Although I am not prepared to give any undertaking as to proposing legislation on these matters, the point is one of which I will make a note in the event of any legislation on the subject of roads being proposed.
 *MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I only rise to say that, in the opinion of the people of Manchester, which forms one of the termini of the proposed extension, this line ought to be made. We know that the line is one that would greatly lessen the cost of goods traffic from the great centres of northern industry to London, and we ought in these days of keen competition to welcome any investment that will promote improved facilities in the conduct of trade.
(11.14.)  MR. HOWARD VINCENT  Sheffield, Central) : I am sensible that this is a matter of some delicacy to invite a Parliamentary discussion upon, namely, the Treaties of Commerce with foreign Powers; but I shall be very careful to say nothing offensive to any foreign nation, and, therefore, this objection will not apply to my remarks. The notice which stands in my name is as follows:—
 "To call attention to the provision in the Treaty of Commerce concluded with Belgium in 1862, and with the Zollverein in 1865, in restraint of preferential importation by British Colonies of goods of British origin; and to move, That, in the opinion of this House, Foreign engagements which hinder the full development of trade within the Empire should he terminated as soon as practicable."
 MR. PLUNKET : In answer to the question of the hon. Gentleman, I do not think I can arrange for a bookstall in the Lobby for the convenience of Members wishing to buy and post newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets. I do not know of any place in the Lobby that would be suitable for the establishment of such a bookstall. On some nights the Lobby is crowded, and the bookstall might be an inconvenience.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I have read the Report of the Director of the National Gallery for 1890. The Government will, of course, be prepared to carry out the promise I made on their behalf in 1889—that, when they are satisfied that more space is required for the extension of the National Gallery, it should be found in the adjoining barrack-yard; and I am sure that any representation made to the Government by the Trustees of the National Gallery will receive very careful consideration. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that in 1887 a very large extension of the exhibition galleries was completed, at the cost of £50,000, by which five new rooms, a vestibule, and a staircase were added to the hanging space. No doubt it would be better if the galleries were entirely detached from the barracks, which at one point they now adjoin, but this matter has not been overlooked; and some years ago the divisional wall between the two buildings, was carried up to a considerable height above the roof of the National Gallery, and all other possible precautions will continue to be taken for protection from fire.
 *MR. PLUNKET : It is true that at one point the two buildings are very close together; but the precautions I have spoken of have already been taken, and we are at present considering a scheme for providing a better supply of water in case of fire.
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University : The statement referred to in the question does not accurately represent the course taken by the Government with regard to the South Kensington and Paddington Tramway Bill—now withdrawn. The scheme had, I think, some good points, especially in so far as it aimed at providing better communication between the South Kensingtom Railway Station and the Albert Hall, and other public buildings in that neighbourhood, and no doubt the promoters believed that it would minister greatly to the wants of the public; but so far a it affected Kensington Gardens the view I took was that the making of the tramway would cause considerable inconvenience to the public during the time of its construction, and must involve the immediate loss of some fine trees, and serious risk to others, and that it would require a very strong case of public advantage to be made out on their side in order to overcome these objections. I was in correspondence in this sense with the promoters when the Bill was withdrawn; and I had not at any time undertaken to withhold opposition if the Bill should go to a Committee, much less did I ever promise to support it.
*(5.58.)  MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.B.) : I agree that the allegations that have been made against the action of some of the School Boards as to the making of these Returns are of a serious character; but that is a matter for the Public Accounts Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Poplar is a Member of the Committee, as I am myself, and I am sure will agree with me in asking that these allegations should not at this stage be assumed by the House to have been proved. There will be extremely delicate questions which we shall have to consider in the Public Accounts Committee to-morrow, and I do not think we ought now to pronounce any judgment on them.
 MR. BOULNOIS : I could never understand why, when mention is made of St. John's Wood, there should be a laugh. I can only say that the residents of St. John's Wood do not look on this as a laughing matter. Probably the locality is little known to hon. Members who come from the country. They may drive as far as Lord's and occasionally go further, but they do not know anything of the unique character of the locality-Let me read a short description by a lady whose name I am sure will command respect—Miss Octavia Hill—who wrote a forcible letter to the  Times "Here is a space, free for light and air to pass over to the more crowded districts, its wide streets bordered with gardens in which laburnum and hawthorn make the spring bright for all who walk from the Lisson Grove district to Regent's Park or Hampstead Heath, over which for all Marylebone the wind sweeps fresh and free." 1205 1206
(3.36.)  MR. BOULNOIS  (Marylebone, E.) : I am quite aware that it is unusual to oppose a Bill of this nature on the Second Reading, and that the Chairman of Committees is most averse to any attempt to throw out a Private Bill upon this stage. But I think that the hon. Member for Gateshead (Mr. James) has said quite sufficient to justify the House in taking the Bill into consideration; and I think I shall be able to show that there are exceptional circumstances which render it necessary in regard to this measure that the House should pronounce an opinion. There are three grounds on which I oppose the Bill; and the first is that there are a great number of persons who are injuriously and seriously affected by the provisions of the measure who are unable to be heard anywhere except through their Representatives in this House. The Bill affects a considerable number of persons whose property lies outside the lines of deviation, and although they may present Petitions they cannot be heard if the Bill goes into Committee. In such cases no com-

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire Horncastle : I have been in communication with the hon. Member (Sir John Pope Hennessy) with regard to the Amendment he has proposed, and I have explained to him it is not possible for the Amendment to be inserted in the Army Annual Bill: it ought to be proposed on the Naval Discipline Bill. I have given the hon. Member for North Kilkenny an undertaking that when my noble Friend the First Lord of the Admiralty brings in the Naval Discipline Bill he will consider favourably the proposal of the hon. Member.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : It is impossible for me to give that undertaking considering the state of public business. I will communicate with my noble Friend and see if he is willing to undertake that task.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : I have seen the statement referred to by my hon. Friend, and from this, as well as from other information which has reached me, I am glad to be able to repeat what I have already stated in this House on a telegraphic despatch, that it is clear that what I then said was correct, and that the honour of a very distinguished regiment is entirely freed from an unfounded charge of insubordination.
(2.16.)  MR. WHITLEY  (Liverpool, Everton) : Some objections have been raised to the Second Reading of this Bill by hon. Members opposite, and they are all directed to a clause which enables the company to build a hotel. On behalf of the company I am authorised to say that as there is a general objection to the clause, if the Bill goes to a Committee, the clause will be withdrawn. Under these circumstances I hope that the opposition to the Second Reading will not be pressed.
(4.14.)  MR. DE LISLE  (Leicestershire, Mid.) : This line will run through about 15 miles of the Division which I represent, and a Petition has been presented to this House, signed by some 15,000 of the ratepayers and leaseholders. The Town Council of Loughborough have petitioned against the Bill, but, as far as I can ascertain, that is on a question of  locus standi 1218
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether, having regard to the difficulty of providing for an accurate revision of the County Electors' Lists, and to the probable addition to county expenditure and possible breakdown in the proceedings for revising the Lists before November 1st, he will consider the

 MR. CHANNING : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been called to the evidence at the inquest on George Wells, a platelayer of the North London Railway Company, who was killed at Highbury Station at 9 a.m. on 6th February, from which it appears that Wells came on duty at 6 a.m. on 5th February, worked till 5.30 p.m., resumed duty at 11 p.m. on the 5th, and would, if he had not been killed, have continued on duty till 5.30 p.m. on the 6th, and thus was on duty no less than 21½ hours, divided by an interval of only 5½ hours' rest, up to the time of his death, and would, if the accident had not occurred, have been on duty for 30 hours, with an interval of only 5½ hours; and whether the Board of Trade have made representations to the North London Railway Company,
 1226
 MR. SEAGER HUNT : The hon. Baronet's position is quite important enough. If the London portion of the Bill were withdrawn, then the opposition, so faras St. John's Wood is concerned, would die away. The fact that certain residences would be spoiled, and that property would fall in value in consequence of this Bill, appeared to excite the derision of the hon. Member for Northampton. But the injury sustained by the owners of these properties is real; besides which, theerection of the terminus would adversely affect the squares and thoroughfares of Marylebone by drawing through them an immense amount of miscellaneous traffic. I sincerely trust that the Bill will not be read a second time.
 MR. SEAGER HUNT  (Marylebone, W.) : We have been told that we ought to support this Bill, because the hon. Baronet, who is the promoter, has selected the site for the terminus in St. John's Wood. Will the hon. Baronet say that he is prepared to drop the London portion of his Bill for this year? ["No!"] What, then, is the value of the assertion that he is prepared to adopt an alternative site?
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I believe it will be unnecessary to exercise any compulsory powers as to the more frequent publication of balance-sheets, as I have reason to believe that the Joint Stock Banks will themselves act in this direction. I have heard rumours to the effect that my hon. Friend informed the banks that they need not fear that I should be able to bring any compulsion to bear on them; and I must not be lured by the question into any declaration that in no case would I ask Parliament for compulsory powers; but I shall be most gratified if the Joint Stock Banks should, as I expect they will, meet public opinion and the circumstances of the day of their own accord.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The Bank of England holds its banking privileges, including issue of notes, upon condition of making certain payments to the Exchequer, under the Bank Act of 1844, but subject to redemption upon 12 months' notice and on repayment by Parliament of the debt due by Government to the Bank. The Bank of England manages the Public Debt at certain rates of remuneration fixed by the Act of 1861. These rates continued in force until the 5th of April, 1886, and thenceforward until Parliament shall otherwise direct. The Bank of England transacts the ordinary banking business of the Government, having the use in return of the Government balances. This agreement can be revised at any
 1233
(6.39.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I am gratified to see that there is a general consensus of opinion in the House in favour of the Bill, and I thank hon. Members for the reasonable criticism which has been offered. When the Bill gets into Committee it will be my anxious wish to meet any reasonable Amendments as far as I can. I agree with my right hon. Friend opposite that the audit must not be one instituted by the Government, and that the Committee of Inspection must not be nominated by the Government. Its constitution will be a question to be dealt with in Committee.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I think it would be better to refer the Bill to the Standing Committee, on account of the danger that there may not be sufficient time found for its discussion in the House. My experience last year was a rather unhappy one in this respect, and I should prefer to have the Bill referred to the Standing Committee, so that we might make progress with the Bill while other business was going on.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I suggest that we should, in the ordinary way, refer the Bill to a Committee of the Whole House, and see how we get on. If it be found impossible to find time for it, or if the proceedings be delayed, the Bill might then be referred to the Standing Committee, if hon. Members assent to the adoption of such a course.
(6.42.)  MR. HOWELL : I think the right hon. Gentleman will be well advised to take it in Committee of the Whole House. Otherwise I am afraid we shall have to move Amendments at a later stage, which will raise the whole of the questions involved in the Bill. If the Bill goes to a Standing Committee and discussions occur upon it in this House in addition, we shall run a great risk of losing the Bill altogether. As one desirous of seeing the Bill passed into law, I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to agree to the measure being dealt with by a Committee of the Whole House.
(6.25.)  MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : I am glad we have got to the point when we are able to say a few words upon the Second Reading of this Bill, and I am exceedingly glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland (Mr. Storey) is not present to delay the Second Reading. For nearly five years we have been trying to get

*(6.32.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : Having been Chairman of the Committee to which this subject was referred two years ago, I wish to express a general approval of the details of the Bill. It affords an illustration of the fact that the delay of a year in the consideration of the Bill is not always thrown away, and I am glad to see that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has availed himself of the opportunity to remove points of difficulty which have occurred. As to the Committee of Inspection, however, I am rather disposed to agree with the hon. Member for Islington that the method proposed is a roundabout process. Almost everything will depend on the constitution of the Committee. If it is to consist of nominees of the Government, then the Government will be practically responsible for the savings in the Trustee Banks. Two years ago the Select Committee unanimously came to the conclusion that the Audit Board should not be a Government Board, and that the Government should not undertake an audit for the savings banks. I hope that some other means will be devised of selecting the persons who are to form the Committee of Inspection. In regard to the general subject of Trustee Savings Banks, I must again point out that, if the regulations laid down by the Act with regard to Trustee Savings Banks are properly carried out, there can be no doubt that security will be afforded to the depositors. Those regulations, however, have not in some cases been properly carried out, especially in the case of audit. Many of the banks, of course, carry out a system of continuous audit, which makes them perfectly safe, but undoubtedly a small section of the smaller banks do not strictly carry out the regulations with regard to audit, and the result is that the depositors are placed in considerable danger. The scheme of the Bill is to supply this deficiency.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : If the right hon. Gentleman waits until the Amendments are on the Paper he will be able to form a judgment as to whether the Bill is likely to occupy much time or not.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I think in that case the Bill had better not be proceeded with, especially as it is already passed ten minutes to 7.
(3.20.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I agree that, as a general rule, it is better to relegate these questions to Committees; but for the last 15 years those interested in the preservation of open spaces have raised the question of Bills of this kind, because open spaces have not received good treatment at the hands of Committees. In the present case the question is not merely a question in regard to Nottingham. I am of opinion that there should be more communication between the Midlands and London; but the terminus should be well chosen, and that proposed has not been as well chosen as it might have been. I have put down an Instruction, in the event of the Second Reading being carried, empowering the Committee to consider whether some better site for a terminus could not be selected, and I understand that the promoters of the Bill are not unprepared to consent to that Instruction. On the strict understanding that the Committee will be able to consider the question of alternative termini, I will not object to the Second Reading.
 SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Bridgeton, Glasgow) : I should like to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether I am right in understanding him to have said that the Lords' Amendments to the Tithes Bill will be taken on Thursday.

 1245
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : Will the right hon. Gentleman say definitely when the Government will move the Speaker out of the Chair for the Civil Service Estimates?
*(5.45.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : I think from the view expressed just now by the Secretary to the Treasury, it is obvious that this is not the moment to enter into a discussion of the merits of this question, but I think the hon. Member for Glasgow deserves credit for having brought this matter forward, because so strong a Report has not been made by the Controller and Auditor General to the House of Commons on any other subject in any part of the Estimates. My hon. Friend has long been opposed to these fee-paying schools as a matter of public policy, and he asked the House of Commons clearly to understand that, so far as judgment has hitherto been passed on the question in concern, the result of this defect in public policy has been that considerable financial abuses had occurred. We understand from the Secretary to the Treasury that the whole question will be inquired into by the Public Accounts Committee, and that it will be seen whether the Scotch Education Department should have responded to the invitation of the Comptroller and Auditor General and whether the Public Accounts Committee wish them to respond to it now. I was not surprised to hear that the Treasury pay the greatest respect to the opinions of the Committee on Public Accounts, and that there is not the least probability, or even possibility, of money being paid on account of any Service of which the Committee may disapprove.
 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to ask the first Commissioner of Works if he can arrange for a bookstall somewhere in the Lobby for the convenience of Members wishing to buy and post newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, &c.?
 MR. ATKINSON : I also wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will state when the present agreement with the Bank of England expires; what are its terms and conditions; whether he proposes to make any change in the agreement now to be made; and for how many years he proposes to make it?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with reference to the paragraph in Saturday's  Times 1232 "There is reason to believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not propose-to give legislative effect to the suggestion that private banks should be compelled to publish periodical balance sheets,"
*(3.0.)  MR. BROADHURST  (Nottingham, W.) : I rise on behalf of the constituency I have the honour to represent to appeal to the House to give a Second Reading to this Bill. I am much surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead should take the extreme course of trying to defeat the Bill on the Second Reading, and thereby deprive the promoters of the right of being heard in its favour. But my hon. Friend did not seem to throw his heart into the business of opposition; he rather spoke as a person who regretted he had undertaken the duty of opposing. The hon. Gentleman who has just sat down pleaded somewhat pathetically for the interests of the people of St. John's Wood. No one desires seriously to

 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : The arrangement for the re-survey of the six Scotch counties on the 1–2,500 scale is to employ upon it four of the field divisions now engaged in re-surveying Lancashire and Yorkshire on the same scale. One of these divisions will commence work in Edinburghshire during the course of the present year, and the others, I hope, next year. The work in Lancashire and Yorkshire has been so heavy, and the town areas have been so large, that the re-survey has taken longer than was expected; it is, therefore, not possible at present to say when the three divisions will commence work in Scotland. No accurate estimate could at present be made of the date when the re-survey of the Scotch counties will be completed, but when once taken up it will be pushed forward as quickly as possible. The levellers are already at work in advance of the re-survey.
 MR. CHAPLIN : I am afraid I cannot add anything to the answer I have given.
 MR HOBHOUSE  (Somerset, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether the expenses of a Sanitary Authority incurred in acquiring land for allotments, which are required by Section two (2) of "The Allotments Act, 1887," to be recouped out of the rents, include the annual instalments of the principal of the purchase-money, or only the interest payable on the purchase-money?

(3.27.)  SIR H. JAMES  (Bury, Lancashire) : It is evident from what has been said in this House and outside that a great interest exists in the preservation of Lord's, and the House will agree in sharing that view. When the Bill was first introduced it was felt that a most serious attack was being made upon the preservation of Lord's Cricket Ground. The committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club, of which I have the honour to be a member, and the acting chairman of which is Sir Spencer Ponsonby Fane, is composed of cricketers like Lord Lyttleton, Mr. Ridley, and Mr. Walker, who have a most practical knowledge of what is necessary for the preservation of a cricket ground, and who, as every cricketer in England knows, are most jealous of the interests of the Club. The committee at first decided to oppose the Bill, and to try to prevent the substantial injury they thought it would do the ground; but they were approached by the promoters, who expressed their wish in no way to interfere with the ground. The Railway Company offered the Marylebone Cricket Club certain terms for the preservation of Lord's Ground. I do not recognise that offer as the substituting of four tubes instead of making an open cutting. What has in effect been done is the withdrawal of the deposited plans; and the promoters, instead of taking a substantial part of the cricket ground, have agreed to confine their operations to tunnelling a narrow strip at the extreme end, which forms part of the practice ground. The land required for the tunnel will be 124 feet in breadth, and the work is to be carried on between

(3.35.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : The opposition to this Bill going into Committee in the ordinary course is not based on any opposition to the railway or to the proposal that there should be a new terminus in London, but is simply directed to the fact that it is proposed to have the terminus in St. John's Wood. The hon. Member opposite—the Member for St. John's Wood—who seconded the Amendment, based his opposition upon two grounds: first, that St. John's Wood

 MR. MATTHEWS : I can only repeat the answer which I gave on the 5th inst.—that my attention has been called to this matter, and that the Government, while they will do their best to enforce the existing law, do not contemplate legislation on this subject.
 *MR. MATTHEWS : I have asserted that everybody has a right to prosecute, and therefore the police do so when the necessary evidence is procurable. But when the hon. Member chooses to assume that betting at Tattersall's is unlawful, and that the police deserve censure because they do not prosecute that establishment, I assert that such a charge cannot be justly sustained. The police do not possess evidence to show that the transactions there are illegal, and they would be exceeding their proper functions if they prosecuted. With regard to the betting commission agents, I confess that I have no sympathy with them. Theirs is rather a dirty and a shabby trade. But I cannot help pointing out to the hon. Member that it would be extremely difficult to frame a law which would strike at them, and which would not also strike at other agents who take commissions. It is to be observed that a commission agent derives no profit himself whether a bet is won or lost. He carries out the instructions he receives, and he must back or lay according to the wish of his employer. I am bound to say that much as I dislike betting, and the commission agent's relation to it, yet I do not see how you are to frame an Act to strike at them which would not also strike equally at the Stock Exchange jobber or the commission agent in the Cotton Market. Therefore, Sir, while I sympathise in the

 MR. MATTHEWS : I must humbly and respectfully ask the hon. Member where is the scheme by which it can be ascertained what kind of baccarat is played, and how is he to ascertain that baccarat of any sort, or of either sort, is played in any house unless the house is to be entered and searched? Will he say that every house, from 10 in the evening, is to be liable to be searched? Will he picture to himself the consequence if every house is to be liable to be entered and searched by the police to see whether baccarat is played or not?
 *MR. MATTHEWS : I am not aware of any sworn evidence.
 *MR. MATTHEWS : I am always willing to submit to interruptions, but not to a running fire of them. I would again ask how possibly, if a thing of that sort is to be turned into an offence against the law, how can it be suppressed or put down by the police except by domiciliary visits? The information is not to be got. If the hon. Member were himself taking part in the game, I am quite sure he would not voluntarily go and tell the police. We do not have domestic spies and traitors in our social life, and the only possible means by which the thing can be ascertained will be that the police should have the power of entry and search. That would be simply intolerable. There are some defects which are due to the state of the law, and some due obviously to the defects of its machinery. The House does not want a Select Committee to advise it on the subject. I have here in my box a Bill which I prepared three years ago to consolidate and amend the law relating to gaming; but I have been prevented from bringing it in, partly because I had not the time, partly because I did not think it was pressing. I want no Select Committee to point out what are the requisite amendments in the law. I do not see that the law fails to reach very serious abuses of gambling, either in card playing or betting. It seems to me to reach all the real evil of that class of misdemeanour, and the reason why the law is not more efficient to prevent those practices is because of the great difficulty, the absolute impossibility, of proof. No legislation could overcome that difficulty. And so, although I repeat that this discussion may have done good by showing what the opinion of this House is about such pursuits, I strongly deprecate the appointment of a Select Committee, as the inquiry would end in no commensurate benefit.
 *MR. RAIKES : I have read the article in question, and I find that both the newspaper and the hon. Member have shifted their ground. What they originally sought was the assimilation of the method of counting figures in Press telegrams with that which obtains in regard to ordinary telegrams. A concession was involved in such assimilation, and I was not prepared to grant it. The suggestion now made is, that a new method of counting should be adopted. I have considered this method, but I do not regard it as being preferable to the present one, which affords greater security for accuracy in transmission.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : I have given directions for the establishment of a service which will, I believe, meet such public demand as exists for the more rapid transmission of single letters. I have to point out that it is my duty to protect the public interests entrusted to the Post Office by Act of Parliament, and I cannot, therefore, without dereliction of duty, allow organised services for the collection and delivery of letters or the transmission of telegrams to be set up side by side with those of the Department. In reply to the question of the noble Marquess (the Marquess of Carmarthen), I have to say I am advised that the conveyance and delivery of letters by the company is illegal, and if continued it will be my duty to take such proceedings as may be necessary to prevent infringement of the law. A person wishing to send a letter on his own private affairs may legally employ a special messenger on his own account.
 1231
 *MR. RAIKES : I do not think it will be necessary to come to Parliament for a Supplementary Vote. As regards the question put by my hon. Friend behind me, I shall be very glad, if the experiment succeeds in London, to consider how far and in what cases it may be introduced in the large provincial towns.
 *MR. RAIKES : The matter is under the consideration of my expert advisers, and it is hoped and believed that some such service can be established.
(4.18.)  MR. WIGGIN  (Staffordshire, Handsworth) : It appears to me, from the speech just delivered by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Sheffield (Mr. Mundella) and the remarks made earlier in the day by the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Barnes), that an erroneous impression has been conveyed to the mind of the House that the Midland Railway Company are unable to carry the traffic up to London. The fact is that during the late intensely cold weather there was a great scarcity of coal trucks, and it was on account of the want of such trucks that the hon. Member for Chesterfield could not get his coal brought up to London. I am satisfied, from my own knowledge, that the North Western, the Great Northern, the Midland, and the Great Eastern Railway Companies, which pass through densely-populated districts of the country, are quite able to bring all their traffic up to London, and a great deal more if they could get it.
 *MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R. Holmfirth) : I do not think this Bill ought to be allowed to pass without some explanation.
 MR. BARCLAY  (Forfarshire) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he can state or give as a Return the quantity of game imported from Norway during the first quarter of 1890?
(5.32)  MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : The Accountant General has gone into elaborate detail to show that the School Board Returns are practically fallacious. The whole gist of the Report is that Returns are made which have the effect of deceiving him, and he asks that an officer of the Education Department and one from his own Department should be sent into the localities to inquire whether these Returns are correct or not. I venture to say that no Government Department would refuse such an appeal from the Accountant General; yet the Scotch Education Department refuse to assist in making such a local investigation. Why? Because they know that these Returns are fallacious, and that the Government have been defrauded by them. What interest can any Department of the Government have in refusing to make a local inquiry which would have no other effect than to show how the facts stand? There is no use in having an Accountant General at all if he is not to have the means of ascertaining whether the Returns presented to him are true or false. If it were only the Government that was being defrauded I do not suppose that any Scotch Member would say one word about it. It is

 MR. MACLEAN  (Oldham) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether his attention has been called to an article in the  Journalist 1235
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been drawn to the case of "James Holmes  v "The full and entire amount of all wages, the earnings of labour in the hosiery manufacture …… without any deduction or stop page of any description whatsoever," 1228
 MR. PICTON : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether there is any intention to adopt the recommendation made in paragraph 25, page 9, of the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, namely—
 "That there should be one Foreign Service, entered by limited competition, and on the same examination as that which now obtains for the Foreign Office;"
(4.12.)  MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : Had it not been that the Rules of the House prevented it, I would have presented to the House a Petition from Leicester, signed by the merchants and inhabitants of Leicester in favour of this Bill, on the ground that the line would give direct communication between London, Manchester, Nottingham, and Sheffield. The earnest desire of large trading populations ought to be taken into consideration, and certainly ought to weigh against the sentimental interests of the romantic neighbourhood of St. John's Wood.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : Yes, Sir; the Secretary for Scotland has received representations showing the existence of some dissatisfaction among the members of the Force; but after giving the most careful attention to the question he does not think there is any real ground for complaint. A reference to the Act, and to the evidence taken before the Select Committee on the Bill, will show that the existence of the Police Pension Fund at Greenock was taken into full consideration by Parliament when the Bill was under discussion; and there appears to be no reason to think that any departure is now necessary from the decision deliberately arrived at for dealing with the fund.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : When the Select Committee was sitting gentlemen were sent up to represent the interests of the Force. The case was very carefully considered, and I think if any dissatisfaction exists it is due to a misunderstanding of the results that were brought out in the inquiry.
(5.41.)  THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : The hon. Member is hardly well advised in referring to a question which is at present  sub judice 1244
 MR. J. STUART  (Shoreditch, Hoxton) : Will that refer also to the election of the London County Council?
 MR. TALBOT  (Oxford University) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether he is aware that students in residential training colleges have little more than four months to prepare for the matriculation examination at the London University, whereas students in the new day training colleges have the full academic year for the same purpose; and whether he proposes to remedy this apparent injustice?
(4.8.)  MR. COURTNEY : If I am not mistaken, there is a feeling in the House that the Bill ought to go before a Committee; and I cannot help thinking that the questions which have been raised are questions which ought to be determined not by the House, but by the Committee, who would be able to compare the balance of gains and losses of the various districts outside the Metropolis and in London itself. I refer to the manufacturing towns of Manchester, "Sheffield, and Leicester, and the agricultural County of Buckingham. There is no opposition in the Metropolis to the measure except in the area affected by it. I do not scoff at the gentlemen who, living in St. John's Wood, oppose the Bill; and I have no doubt that if I resided there I would oppose it tooth and nail to get the terminus sent elsewhere. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bradford suggests that the great railway termini should be near together, and no doubt that is desirable; but the question whether this is a desirable arrangement, as proposed by the Bill, is one which should be decided by the Committee, and is surely not one which the House could determine. I hope the House will refrain from deciding questions which can only be properly investigated and determined by a Committee.
(2.10.)  MR. COURTNEY  (Cornwall, Bodmin) : The hon. Member for North Islington (Mr. Bartley) raised this question on the Second Reading, and it was again raised in Committee, but on neither stage was the hon. Member able to make out a case. The hon. Member says that the company, having acquired land for one purpose, ought not to be allowed to devote it to another; but this Bill will not give the company the power which the hon. Member imagines it does. The Bill leaves the question regarding the land exactly as it stood before, and the rights of the parties will remain the same. All that the Bill does is to leave to the company the rights they had before, and it would be altogether outside our Parliamentary practice to tack on to the Bill a provision which in effect amounts to an attempt to place a legal construction upon an agreement.
 MR. MARK STEWART  (Kirkcudbright) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture if he can state when the postponed surveys on the 1–2,500 scale maps of the six Scotch counties, Fife and Kinross, Mid and East Lothian, Kirkcudbright and Wigtown, will be
 1225
(10.22.)  MR. M. J. STEWART  (Kirkcudbright) : I am satisfied that the speech to which we have just listened reflects in great measure a large body of opinion outside this House, and though that opinion may not seem to be shared by the great majority of Members of this House, judging from the small attendance to-night, there are many present who are determined to use their utmost efforts to check, and, if possible, to exterminate this evil. Gaming and betting are matters with regard to which the House of Commons should speak with no uncertain voice, as the country will look to our views on such subjects for guidance. We should, at all events, satisfy our constituents that this matter is not wholly disregarded. Though it is not easy to keep a House on such a night as this, I am glad to see there are a certain number of men who are ready to stand up and speak their minds on the subject. I suppose most hon. Members have been on a racecourse. I am bound to say that of recent years I have not been near one, and the reason is that some of my great friends—men I was at college with, and men with whom I have since been associated—have not only lost their all, but have ruined their families through their gambling propensities, as displayed on the racecourse. The destruction and woe and misery which have been entailed on different noble families through this cause are so appalling that I should shrink from stating individual cases. We know that the racecourse does not necessarily entail gambling and betting. Horse-racing is one of the noblest pastimes if properly conducted, and it encourages the breeding of good horses. When, however, that sport is demoralised and lowered, as it so frequently is in these days, it is time to resist the pressure placed upon us to induce us to attend race-meetings, and to warn others, especially the young,

 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I have not the information referred to by the hon. Member; but I am in communication with the Foreign Office, with a view of ascertaining whether all or any of it can be procured.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The import lists do not distinguish game from poultry. The imports of game and poultry from Norway in the first quarter of 1890 amounted to £3,246 in value, of which the great bulk is believed to have consisted of game.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : My attention has been called to the fatal accident referred to, and I have received a communication from the Railway Company on the subject. The company state that on February 5th the deceased platelayer had been working at his ordinary duties from 7 in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon; but, after having rested until half-past 11, was specially employed on overtime in a relaying operation, which could not be carried out until after the passenger traffic had ceased. They attribute the accident to failure on the part of another company's driver to give warning. I shall be glad to show the hon. Member the correspondence on the subject. I will consider the question of the Reports.
 *DR. FARQUHARSON : Is it not a fact that portions of the barracks are actually in contact with the Turner room, which contains some of the greatest Art treasures in the Gallery; and whether two fires have not already taken place in barracks in or near London?
 DR. FARQUHARSON  (Aberdeenshire, W.) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether his attention has been called to that portion of the Annual Report of the Director of the National Gallery for 1890, in which he calls attention to the crowded state of the Gallery, and the impossibility of maintaining a systematic classification of the pictures until further accommodation is provided, and expresses a hope that the Treasury will not long delay to carry out the promise made by the First Commissioner of Works in 1889, that, inasmuch as the ground acquired for the extension of the National Gallery had been used for the National Portrait Gallery, the Government would, if more space were required for the National Gallery, remove St. George's Barracks elsewhere; whether the crowded state of the rooms, and the impossibility of hanging more pictures, now suggests an enlargement of the Gallery; and whether he will consider the advisability of removing St. George's Barracks, and thus

(6.38.)  MR. FINLAY  (Inverness, &c.) : I wish to express in one sentence
 1257
 *MR. S. SMITH : Yes, certainly.
*(10.0.)  MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I think the House is much indebted to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green for the very clear and luminous manner in which he has set forth the state of the law on this subject. I think the inconsistency and futility of the laws we have hitherto passed in this House on the subject of gambling must have come home to the mind of every Member of the House. No one will deny that the evil against which the Motion is directed is one which has enormously increased of late years. It must be
 1274 "You will allow me to call your attention to the case of poor hard working men who try to bring up their sons to he useful citizens, and after all to become the victims of the bookmaker, which leads to a dissipated life. In Scotland betting is increasing to an alarming extent. The bookmaker takes from Is. upwards, and very often collects in shops privately, such as publicans, barbers, tobacconists, &c, and then the gentleman bookmaker makes his call in due time before the race, and when the bettor
 1275 Memoirs "In the 'Papers' of the late Mr. Greville you will find him making the following humbling confession in his journal, with reference to his attendance at the Races on Epsom Downs:—'This demoralising drudgery reduces me to the level of all that is most disreputable and despicable, for my thoughts are eternally absorbed by it. Jockeys, trainers, and blacklegs are my companions, and I cannot leave it off, though I am disgusted with the occupation all the time.'" 1276 "Looking round upon the gathering on the ground, one could not help speculating on what might not be the moral effect on England if Epsom Eowns had yawned open and swallowed up that betting, swearing, brutal looking, brazen-throated throng. There they came, streaming up through the clover fields, gay with buttercups and clumps of yellow furze, in hideous din and uproar, as though there were no larks carolling overhead, nor musical tremor of breeze in the woodlands, and nothing delightful in the hazy sunny landscape around. There was a general atmosphere of blackguardism and vulgarity; and a positive relief it was to get out of the thick of it into the quiet green lanes again." 1277 "The principal cause of the increase of betting is the facilities and means afforded by the daily Press. Every day contains the Sporting Intelligence, and under that head is all the information as to the odds where they may be obtained, the various 'tips,' &c, which inflame the imagination and prove a terrible temptation to youths to speculate, and then, having lost, to obtain somehow the money which has to be paid." Leeds Mercury 1278 1279
(5.56.)  MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : The point here is that a deliberate attempt has been made to deceive the Treasury and the Education Department in regard to the amount of fees charged in certain Board Schools, especially in Glasgow. The Lord Advocate just now said the case was not one of plain sailing, and that there is a good deal to be said on both sides. No doubt there is a good deal to be said on both sides as to the question of the average 9d. fee, and whether you should take it for the whole of the children or
 1247
 MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I think also it would be more convenient if the Bill could be discussed in Committee of the Whole House.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope to do so on Monday, but we must take these measures by themselves first of all. One business must be finished before we go on with the other.
 MR. W. H. SMITH : I must ask the hon. Member to wait till the terms of Reference are before the House.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I have every reason to hope that it will be possible to take the Lords' Amendments to the Tithes Bill on Thursday.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : It will be substantially the first Order, although we may have to take one or two small matters before it. I shall, however, be able to make a positive statement tomorrow on the subject. Arrangements have been made by which we hope to get the Amendments made by the Lords printed and circulated to-morrow, or, at all events, made available to hon. Members at 12 o'clock. On Friday we shall proceed with the Bills which are on the Paper for to-day, and with other Bills.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : The attention of Parliament will be invited to the subject in the course of a few days, but not in this House.
(5.30.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : The hon. Member may rest assured that the matter will be carefully considered by the Treasury. There is no Parliamentary work which is more carefully done than this, and the special attention of the Public Accounts Committee will be drawn to the point.
 MR. JACKSON : That is in the ordinary course.
*(5.54.)  MR. SINCLAIR  (Falkirk &c) : I hope the hon. Member will withdraw his Motion; but, at the same time, I am not sorry—as other speakers have said—that the subject should have been brought forward. I should not have risen if some hon. Members had not taken it for granted that the feeling of Scotland is against these high fee schools. No doubt there is a feeling against them in some quarters, but it is by no means universal. These schools have done good work, and they continue to do good work. It must never be forgotten that our Scotch system of education is carried out under an Education. Act, and not an Elementary Education Act, as is the case in England. There' is no limit of fees in the original Scotch Act, but by an accident or slip of legisslation the 9d. limit, which is in the English Act, was introduced into the Scotch system. I trust the appeals which were made to the Government at the time when the fees were removed from the compulsory standards, to define for the future what should and what should not constitute the 9d. limit, will, in consequence of the present difficulty, be carefully reconsidered by them. I trust that during the present Session the Government will deal with this question by legislation.
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I merely rise to ask whether the time has not come when the House should decide this question? I think the growing practice in this House of debating these Bills on the Second Reading is a very undesirable one. We have under the pressure of public business begun Morning Sittings to-day, and what has become of this Morning Sitting? It has been devoted to what I call the most trumpery opposition to a railway undertaking that I have ever heard in the House of Commons. It carries us back to a period 40 years ago, when I remember the Great Northern Bill was thrown out on the opposition of the Badsworth Hunt, merely because it would interfere with sport in their district. Are we really going back to those days? It would almost seem so when we find an hon. Member getting up and saying that in the future some interest in Lord's Cricket Ground may be injured which is not injured now. This is the opposition which is offered to a Bill for the promotion of a great industrial undertaking which is to benefit hundreds of thousands of our population. A more discreditable vote could never be given by the House of Commons than a vote which would throw out such a measure on such grounds as these. To give such a vote would show that the House of Commons, which professes to be the representative of the interests of the people, prefers the amusements of the few to the interests of the many. I am quite certain that the House of Commons will not give such a vote as that. I am glad to see the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade in his place. I am quite sure that he is not about to vote against a Bill which, whatever else it does, must be for the benefit of the trade of the country, and of the district it will traverse, and of the great Metropolis it will serve. That these interests should be deliberately sacrificed by the House of Commons to the very trumpery interests set up in opposition to the Bill is a thing which I

 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the Government of Newfoundland will be directly represented at the arbitration on the "French Shore Difficulty" by a delegate from the Colony or only through the Foreign Office?
 *MR. MORTON : I do not wish to interfere with such play as that referred to by the right hon. Gentleman, but with such play as we have heard of as taking place at Tran by Croft.
*(9.50.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : In seconding the Motion, I need not go into the technical and legal aspect of the question, because my hon. Friend has dealt with that thoroughly, and as I am not qualified to do. Only this I say, in relation to the legal doubts and judicial decisions, that if the law is not strong enough it is the duty of "Parliament and the Government to make it effectual for carrying out the object
 1272 Ordered," That the Messengers in waiting do take care there is no gaming or other disorders in Westminster Hall or other passages during the sitting of Parliament." 1273
 MR. MORTON : That is to come.
 MR. MORTON : May I remind the right hon. Gentleman that there is sworn evidence that baccarat was played at Tranby Croft?
 THE SECRETARY TO THE ADMIRALTY (Mr. FORWOOD,  Lancashire, Ormskirk : In the unavoidable absence of my noble Friend at the head of the Admiralty, I beg to state that a considerable number of the pictures, relics, and naval models now at Greenwich will be moved to London to form part of the collection to be shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition. From the liberality with which private owners have responded to the appeal made to them, that section of the Exhibition relating to naval pictures and portraits, marine models, and relics, promises to be quite unique from its magnitude and unbroken historical continuity. My hon. Friend could hardly expect that, when private individuals are thus bestirring themselves to assist the Naval Exhibition, the one great national collection of naval pictures and models should not contribute its share, especially when the inhabitants of Greenwich have in ordinary years the benefit of a gratuitous access to the only naval exhibition of pictures and models in the country supported by
 1236
*(5.59.)  DR. CAMERON : I never asked for the pronouncement of a judgment. All I asked of the Government was that, pending the decision of the matter, the Government should not use any of this money in this manner. We have received an assurance that the Government will give due weight to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, and will be guided by their Report. As, therefore, my object has been effected, I will not trouble the House to go to a Division.
*(5.15.)  DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I rise to move the reduction
 1239 1240 1241 the dictum 1242
 DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether the attention of the Secretary for Scotland has been called to the dissatisfaction which exists among the police force of Greenock at the scale of pensions awarded to them under the Act of last year; and whether, in drawing up that scale, any consideration was given to the fact that in Greenock alone in Scotland a police pension fund, showing a large surplus largely constituted of contributions from the men, existed at the date of the passing of the Act; and, if not, if the Scotch Office will consider whether the members of the Greenock force cannot in some way be recouped for the exceptional sacrifices which for many years they were called upon to make?
 *SIR E. WATKIN  (Hythe) : I rise to Order. I am not the promoter of this Bill. I am merely one of 12 Directors representing 12,000 shareholders, who are the promoters.
*(2.35.)  SIR E. WATKIN  (Hythe) : Perhaps I may be allowed to say that there was never any proposal to erect a station with steam and smoke in Parliament Square. The then Minister of Public Works proposed an extension from Paddington to Government land about Delahay Street. That was the project of the right hon. Gentleman.
 MR. POWELL  (Wigan) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether his attention has been called to the prospectus of the Cardiff Day Training College, stating that—
 "In respect of the subjects in which normal students receive instruction in common with

 SIR G. BADEN-POWELL  (Liverpool, Kirkdale) : Will the right hon. Gentleman say whether the system he proposes to establish will be extended to provincial towns?
*(2.7.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N) : I am sorry that I am again compelled to trouble the House in regard to this Bill, but it is a matter of very considerable importance, and I have placed on the Paper an Amendment which I beg to move:—
 "That the Order for Third Reading he read, and discharged, and that the Bill be re-committed to the former Committee.—That it be an Instruction to the Committee to insert Amendments in the Bill providing that the triangular piece of land west of Gloucester Road Station be used only for railway purposes, or for the erection of buildings of a substantial and permanent character." 1198
*(6.5.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : I should like to say a few words upon this Bill, which deals with a subject in which I take the greatest interest. I think we shall all agree the Bill is a step in the right direction—in the direction of doing something towards making deposits in Trustee Savings Banks more secure. It is not an ideal Bill; it is not quite the idea that, if I had my own way, I should have liked to carry out. It would, perhaps, have been wiser to have made an arrangement by which the large banks should have developed like those have of a private nature, and been carried on under special charter, in a way most likely to increase the thrift of a district. Of course, banks are hampered by conditions that obtain in large institutions like the Glasgow Bank, and others which are carried on very well; and had this plan been adopted the smaller banks would have gradually closed and been absorbed by the Post Office Savings Bank. The scheme of the Bill, however, is very reasonable. The Bill really does two things, and is based on the recommendations of the Committee appointed by the House two years ago. It establishes a Board of Inspection or, what may possibly be called, a Board of Audit, and gives much greater power to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt. I am not quite sure that this is wise, but I do not see
 1249 1250 1251
*(6.41.)  MR. BARTLEY : I think the Bill would be got through in less time in Committee of the Whole House.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I understand that the sanction of Parliament will be necessary in regard to the arbitration, and I wish to know when that sanction will be asked for?
 SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if his attention has been called to the measures taken against gambling at horse races in France, alleged to be occasioned by the great development of such gambling among all classes; and whether the Government will consider the propriety of taking measures to put down the evil in Great Britain?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : Do I understand there is no prospect of the survey of Fife being completed within a measurable time?
 MR. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN  reported from the Chairmen's Panel: That they had appointed Mr. Campbell-Bannerman to act as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Law, and. Courts of Justice, and Legal Procedure.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : The Governor of Barbados telegraphed on the 11th inst that Ja Ja had arrived much improved in health. We have not heard any particulars. It is impossible to say at what date the political situation at Opobo will admit of his return. He will be sent back as soon as the circumstances are sufficiently favourable.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : There will in future be one examination qualifying for both the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Services. Political economy will be omitted from the examination. The subjects of examination are settled by the Secretary of State.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Her Majesty's Government have invited the Government of Newfoundland to name a delegate with full local knowlege to represent the colony on the Board of Arbitration, but no final answer has yet been received.
(2.13.)  SIR J. DORINGTON  (Gloucester, Tewkesbury) : As the Chairman of the Committee that dealt with the Bill I wish to say that the whole question raised by the Amendment of the hon. Member opposite was carefully considered, and it appeared that there was a misapprehension. There were two plots of land to which the word "exhibition" might apply; but the

*(6.15.)  MR. LENG  (Dundee) : I concur in the hope that the Bill will now be read a second time. I have had occasion to make representations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the interest of certain Scotch Banks, and I desire to acknowledge the very conciliatory attitude taken by the right hon. Gentleman. He has made large concessions on consideration of the views placed before him, and the Bill in its present form is much amended as compared with the shape in which we had it before us last year. Several of the regulations which were then of a cast-iron character have been made considerably more elastic, and are now very much more likely to meet the requirements of the poorer class of depositors, and those who desire to make investments. I regret, however, that the limit of deposits within the year has not been increased from £630 to £50. I know there is a difficulty in making this alteration in Trustee Savings Banks so long as the limit of £30 is maintained in the Post Office Banks, but at the same time it seems to me that, as compared with the period when £30 was fixed as the limit, the ability of the working classes now to save money has increased very considerably, and the amount of possible yearly savings would now be more nearly represented by £50 than by £30. In the case of Scotch banks these deposit accounts are

*(5.52.)  MR. LENG  (Dundee) : This controversy is of great interest to the School Boards who will be affected by the decision. In my constituency there is one school which alone receives a grant of £1,354, and it will be readily conceived that if this grant had been disallowed very serious inconvenience would have been caused to the School Board of Dundee. At the same time, I quite concur that this matter should be sifted. The School Boards have for some years past conducted their schools on the understanding that if the average fee does not exceed 9d. in the week the grants will be given. In Harris Academy, Dundee, there are 554 scholars paying more than 9d. a week; 196 paying exactly 9d.; 346 paying 8d.; and 108 paying 7d. per week. The fees above 9d. are stated to range from 10d. to 1s. 0½d. per week, while the reputed

 Sir JOHN MOWBRAY  reported from the Committee of Selection: That they had discharged Mr. Burt from the Standing Committee on Trade (including Agriculture and Fishing), Shipping, and Manufacture; and had appointed in substitution: Mr. William M'Arthur.
*(3.12.)  SIR J. PEASE  (Durham, Barnard Castle) : If I were to register my vote according to my own personal interests, I should probably divide against the Second Reading of the Bill; bat I wish respectfully to call the attention of the House to the position in which some of these railway questions stand at the present moment. They seem to take up much more of the time of the House than they used to do; and I cannot help thinking that the House of Commons, in trying to do the work of Committees, is not only in that way occupying time which might more usefully be employed for national purposes, but is also preventing railway measures from receiving in Committees that consideration which commercial interests require. I can recollect the time when the Second Reading of a Railway Bill, except under special circumstances, was never debated in the House itself, but was sent to a Committee in which it could be fully considered and threshed out. It is all very well to talk of Mr. Briton Riviere and Mr. Alma Tadema and other respectable people in the neighbourhood of St. John's Wood, but the real question is how the interests of the Metropolis at large will be affected. I am astonished

 MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) Glamorgan, S. : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the Government are prepared to take steps for giving practical effect to the recommendation of the Accidents in Mines Commission that there should be—
 "An official establishment of some permanent arrangement by which the merits of inventions and suggestions affecting the working of mines may he investigated promptly, thoroughly, and authoritatively."
 MR. S. T. EVANS (in the absence of Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he will obtain and lay upon the Table of the House a copy of the Belgian and Austro-Hungarian tariffs for goods and passengers on the State Railways in those countries, showing the rates and distances in English money and miles, and a copy of the State Returns for 1888, showing the financial working of the railways in those countries?
 MR. BOORD  (Greenwich) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he is aware that the Painted Hall at Greenwich is being stripped of the greater part of the pictures and relics which form the chief attraction to visitors; whether it is also intended to remove the principal models from the College buildings; and when the several objects removed will be replaced?
 SIR W. BARTTELOT  (Sussex, N.W.) : I beg to ask the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for War a question of which I have given him private notice, namely, whether his attention has been called to a letter in to-day's  Times
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The Education Department recognise in day training colleges examinations by the examiners of the college, usually the college professors, in certain subjects, but the papers will be sent to the Department, and the marks will be re-I assessed, so as to bring all students as nearly as possible into line. It may eventually be necessary to ask the colleges to appoint outside examiners, and also to submit the papers that are set to the Inspector of the district; but before laying down any rule, it has been thought expedient to wait for the experience of the first examinations in June and December.
 *THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : I am aware of the apparent anomaly; but it must not be forgotten that the day students have to pass their examination in technical subjects also in June, whereas the residential students have theirs deferred until December. It may be said, therefore, that although day students have the advantage on the matriculation examination, the residential students have the advantage on the certificate examination, as a whole, and can devote the first part of the year chiefly to academic, and the second to technical subjects.
 VISCOUNT GRIMSTON  (Herts, St. Alban's) : I beg to ask the right hon. Gentleman if it is true that arrangements have already been made whereby letters may be taken to railway booking offices, and forwarded thence at a cost of 3d.; and whether these facilities will be accorded equally to the Boy Messengers and District Messengers Companies?
*(1.20.)  THE MARQUESS OF CARMARTHEN  (Lambeth, Brixton) : In rising to move the Amendment which stands in my name, that this Bill be read a second time upon this day six months, I claim that indulgence which the House is always ready to accord to every Member who addresses it for the first time. I daresay I shall be told that I am one of the advocates and apologists for intemperance. I care very little for imputations which I know to be unfounded, and I am just as much opposed to intemperance as the Permissive Bill gentlemen themslves. These are not my own words, Mr. Speaker, but the words of a very great authority on the licensing question—a member, I believe, of the United Kingdom Alliance, namely, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby. I have quoted them in order to carry the conviction to hon. Members opposite, as any words coming from such a source must necessarily do, that I am not the advocate and apologist for intemperance. The hon. Member who introduced this Bill has told us that this is in no way

 *THE MARQUESS OF CARMARTHEN : No doubt the Duke of Westminster may be satisfied with the existing law, but I understood the hon. Member to give us the figures to show that Sunday closing has been instrumental in decreasing drunkenness in Wales.
 *THE MARQUESS OF CARMARTHEN : I hold in my hand the Report of the Commission appointed to inquire into the operation of the Sunday Closing Act in Wales, and I hope the House will allow me to quote a few figures which are there given by the Commissioners. I should state that the Commissioners sent out circulars to the Chief Constables of the 16 police divisions of Wales with a view to gather statistics in reference to drunkenness in, Wales during the five years preceding the Act and five years subsequent to it. The Commissioners say—
 "We thought it right, however, to procure for ourselves, upon a basis carefully prepared, with reference to our inquiry, and so as to be as fair and as free from error as possible such statistics as were available. In doing so we resolved to take the 24 hours from 6 on Sunday
 1304 1305 "We must dismiss as equally impracticable the proposal to close public houses absolutely and for all purposes for the whole of Sunday. Such a law would impose a great hardship on those who legitimately travel on Sunday, and would probably encourage the growth of illicit drinking." "My view remains the same—that the total closing of public houses on Sunday would inevitably result in an enormous increase of shebeens, and bring about a far more demoralising effect than would be caused by leaving matters as they now are." 1306

*(5.7.)  MR. COGHILL  (Newcastle-under-Lyme) : Speaking as a teetotaler of 13 years' standing, I give a cordial support to the Bill. The control of the issue of new licences has been admitted by the Government in their licensing proposals, by which the issue of such licences was to be suspended. We need not go far beyond the precincts of this House to find that the number of licensed houses is far in excess of requirements. We have nothing to expect from the action of Magistrates in this matter. Very recently there was an instance reported in the Press of how the Justices fail to recognise the local opinion in connection with licences. The Kensington Board were petitioned, and strong representations were made to them against the issue of a licence for a house on the ground that the existing number of houses was excessive, and the particular application was for a house opposite the workhouse, and where it would be a continual source of temptation to the inmates when out of the workhouse. The Chairman declined to refuse a licence because, to use his words, "A few old women could not resist temptation." When it was pointed out that there were a large number of old women, still he said he did not care though they were hundreds. There is not much, then, to expect from the action of Magistrates. We have been told of the tyranny of this proposal, but I assert that it is an application of the true principles of Liberty that when the inhabitants of a locality find in their midst more public houses than should be there, then the opinion of the majority should prevail against the tyranny of an influential minority. We wish to secure freedom from the caprice of Magistrates and the dictation of brewers and publicans, and protection

 MR. KNOX : The Bill of which I have custody is also much desired by all classes.
*(5.5.)  COLONEL HUGHES  (Woolwich) : This is a step in legislation directed against one particular trade; but I do not know that the arguments supporting it may not be used in reference to many trades. Take, for instance, the trade or profession of a solicitor. The licence for a solicitor to practise is annually renewed during good behaviour. It is not difficult to prove that litigation in excessive quantities is injurious to the community. One of the features in Jack Cade's programme of reform was first to kill all the lawyers; the reformers of the present day wish to kill the trade of the publicans. If the number of licensed victuallers is too large, and if their houses are open too long, then reduce the number of houses and shorten the hours; but let it be done with fairness, and let any legitimate trader be compensated when he is required to give up his business in what is supposed to be the general interest. In my love for temperance I am not going to be led away into doing an injustice to any

 *MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : The noble Lord who moved the rejection of the Bill expressed his regret that the question has been made a Party question. In that regret I cordially join. But whose fault is it that it has been made a Party question?
 1326 1327 bonâ fide "One of the suggestions most frequently made to us was the Report of the Sunday Closing Act on its modification in the direction of repeal, by permitting the opening of public houses for a short time in the middle or evening of the day, for sale both in or off the premises, or for the table only. "We cannot, after giving the fullest and most careful consideration, endorse either of these recommendations …. We are convinced that a change in either of these directions would be so unwelcome to so vast a majority of the population in so large an area of the Principality, that we do not think it ought to be forced on this larger area for the sake of a possible benefit to the rest of the country. Moreover, we find an almost complete absence of evidence of a desire for such an amendment of the law on the part of those classes who would be most likely to require or use it." 1328

*(3.35.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : Mr. Speaker, I had the honour, yesterday, to receive a deputation from the United Kingdom Alliance in connection with this subject, and they claimed that the Government should allow a fair field and no favour. I have to inform the House that the Government accede to that request, and that we do not intend to put any pressure on those hon. Members who usually support us in the Division Lobbies. The Government leave hon. Members to take whichever line they think best. Speaking, however, for myself, I do not suppose that there is any hon. Member who is not sensible of the enormous mischief of excessive drinking, how much crime, pauperism, and misery throughout the country are due to the habits of intemperance, which, unhappily, are still too prevalent in these Islands. I do not think we are all agreed in the view which has been expressed in the course of the Debate, notably in the speech of the hon. Member for South Tyrone, that the partaking of alcoholic drink is an evil thing in itself, and a public wrong and crime. That is an opinion which I strongly and emphatically repudiate. We all agree that there ought to be a remedy, if we could find one, that would not prove worse than the disease. The hon. Member who introduced the Bill enumerated various legislative failures that have taken place in connection with this subject. In fact, the whole path of the House of Commons is strewn with skeletons and wrecks of legislation affecting the Liquor Question. There was Mr. Bruce's Bill of 1871, the Light Wines Bill, the Grocers' Licence System, restraints on adulteration, all of which have failed. Yet the hon. Member hopes by this particular legislative nostrum to succeed where other men have failed. I think that the hon. Member (Mr. Bowen Rowlands) has overstated the effect of the words which fell from the President of the Local Government Board. My right hon. Friend did not say that temperance could be brought about by legislation, but that wise and well-considered legislation could assist the cause of temperance. I am bound to say, as far as my own observation goes, and as far as I have been able to study the subject, there are many directions which open up a prospect much more hopeful than this rough and coarse

 *MR. J. M. MACLEAN : I asked for proof that it had done so in recent years.
*(1.35.)  MR. J. M. MACLEAN  (Oldham) : I rise to second the Amendment which has been proposed by my noble Friend. It seems to be usual in this House for those Members who are obliged to speak on proposed measures of legislation of this kind to explain that they have no personal or interested motives in taking one side or the other. Personally, I can disclaim any fanaticism and also any pecuniary interest in any distillery or brewery; neither do I take up the question as a politician, for I suppose the temperance vote in the borough I represent is quite as strong as the publican vote. I look at this matter, I think, fairly. Bills of this kind raise the very important question how far it is right for a majority in this country to interfere with the enjoyments and amusements of the minority. By this Bill it is proposed to sweep away entirely the right of the minority in any particular district to drink any kind of strong liquor, and I maintain that would be a very strong measure indeed for this Parliament to take. The hon. and learned Gentleman who moved the Bill rather congratulated himself on the fact that the Bill was an evasion of direct legislation by the Imperial Parliament. I should have admired his courage much more if he had come forward with a Bill for enforcing prohibition throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, but he knows perfectly well a measure of, that kind would have no chance of passing this House. The hon.

But that minority was always a small, and, we think, a diminishing one; we also doubt whether the earnest and zealous advocates of the cause of temperance who have appeared in such large numbers before us would have found their efforts to reduce it still further more hampered by the possibility of obtaining drink under the old system than by the evasion of the present law, which has been proved before us. We admit, however, that the majority of them seem to hold a different opinion. In Cardiff, and some of the mining districts, the Act cannot be said to have diminished intemperence. We have already indicated our opinion, that the provision of places open on Sunday for the enjoyment of social intercourse and innocent recreation, not incompatible with due attention to the religious duties of that day, would prove in practice as strong an inducement to the formation of temperate habits as the mere closing of the public

(5.2.)  MR. J. PARKER SMITH  (Lanark, Partick) : I avail myself of the opportunity of stating the reason why I support this Bill. I do so in conformity with the attitude I took up when I was elected for the constituency I represent, an attitude which by temperance men and by the trade was declared to be sound and satisfactory. Like the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Newcastle I accept the Second Reading of this Bill as a declaration in favour of the principle that there should be a direct reference to the inhabitants of a locality of the question whether there shall be fresh licences, a reduction of licences, or no licences at all. In that question I have Scotland in my mind as well as Wales; the principle is as applicable in the one country as in the other. When, however, we get into Committee on the Bill, we shall find ourselves confronted with

 SIR J. POPE HENNESSY : I am perfectly satisfied with the assurance of the noble Lord.
 *SIR J. POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : I had an Amendment on the Paper with the object of effecting such a change in the law as will enable Marine officers to sit on Courts Martial to try Marines for offences committed when afloat. There is a great deal of interest felt in this question in many quarters, and I trust the Government will be able to give me an assurance that the matter I refer to will not be lost sight of.
(5.29.)  MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I should like to point out what are the provisions of this Bill. The present law provides that our local representatives shall have no interest whatever in the contracts made by the bodies of which they are members. This Bill gives power to County Councillors to make contracts with their own County Councils for the supply of stone and gravel for the maintenance of roads in their districts.
(4.5.)  MR. J. MORLEY  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : The right hon. Gentleman seems to me, judging from his concluding remarks, to have entirely misapprehended the scope and significance of the Bill. Of course, if a population were not inclined to temperance, the powers given to a two-thirds majority under the Bill would not be exercised. The right hon. Gentleman spoke of the five counties in which only 19,000 out of 90,000 ratepayers voted for prohibition. Then, why does the right hon. Gentleman object to the Bill, because in those five counties prohibition could not have been carried? These remarks of his show how little he grasped the scope of the measure. As to Maine and Vermont, the right hon. Gentleman's statements were very extraordinary. He referred to the last official Reports received from the Representatives of Great Britain in the United States. From these Reports I find that in Vermont, where prohibition was adopted in 1852, intemperance is held to have decreased. In Maine prohibition has been in operation for over 40 years, and the results are regarded as so satisfactory by prohibitionists that there is no movement for the repeal of the law. The right hon. Gentleman omitted to mention other States where prohibition had been a distinct success, such, for instance, as Alabama. Our Vice Consul there has testified to that success.

(3.8.)  MR. M. J. STEWART  (Kirkcudbright) : I will not trespass long on the attention of the House, but I wish to say a few words on the principle of this measure, and in support of the Second Reading. I think it will be admitted by all Members, whether for or against the Bill, that a great part of our licensing administration has been a failure. There are several hundreds of Statutes dealing with the subject on the Statute Book, and yet we know as a fact that there is no great diminution of drinking, while public houses are, if not on the increase, at all events, not perceptibly diminishing. I think something ought to be done to restrain the number of those public houses, and unless some severe, and perhaps, what may be called drastic, legislation is placed on the Statute Book, a more moderate measure will not effect the object we have in view. I have always advocated the adoption of moderate measures, and have often reasoned with my temperance friends because they are too anxious to get things all their own way. I feel that you can really only touch this subject by treating it piece by piece. It is all very well to say it would be right and wise to adopt a general measure over the whole country. The hon. Member for Shropshire stated that real and great inconvenience was caused by having a number of public houses situated on the very confines of his county. No doubt a comprehensive measure might be a very useful one, but would that suit all the different localities? I maintain that if this measure is adopted there will be no real hardship in any particular locality, because it will have the assent of two-thirds of the ratepayers.
 1324 bonâ fide 1325
(2.58.)  MR. M'LAGAN  (Linlithgow) : As frequent references have been made to Scotland, I, as a Scotch Member, may be allowed to say a few words. Certainly, I can say the experience in Scotland is that where there is increase in consumption of drink there is increase in disorder, and where there are more licensed houses more police are required. The noble Lord who moved the rejection of the Bill said that Sunday closing in Scotland had been a failure, but he gave us no proof of that. The hon. Member for Oldham, too, said that drinking is carried on secretly.

*(2.45)  MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON  (Shropshire, Oswestry) : As a very old temperance advocate I may be allowed to say a few words on this Bill. I congratulate the hon. Member who has just spoken and the hon. and learned Gentleman who introduced the Bill, upon the tone of their speeches, with a very large portion of which I find myself in agreement. I have used similar language and the same arguments over and over again, and I look at the question from the stand-point of a reformer. Anxious as I am to promote the cause of temperance, I beg leave to impress upon hon. Members that the cause of temperance is universal, and not local. Surely comparatively sober Wales does not, or ought not, to occupy our minds quite so much as disorderly, drunken London. There are more public-houses, in proportion to population, in London than anywhere else; it is to London that temperance reformers ought to turn their attention;

 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : Well, it is quite true that the action of the liquor traffic in this direction may be met by action on the other side. It is quite possible that the consumption of drink may increase in times of prosperity and yet that pauperism may not increase in the way you might naturally expect. But that is not a proof of the innocence of the liquor traffic. It is because increased prosperity enables the people to spend more. But the hon. Member cannot deny the testimony of every Commission and every Committee which has inquired into this subject, that drink is the source of seven-eighths of the crime, of three-fourths of the pauperism, and of nearly all of the destitution of the country. Something was said in the beginning of this Debate about the adulteration of drink, and that has always been an argument with hon. Members. In talking with me and commiserating my total abstinence they have said, "It is not the good drink, it is the bad drink, that does the harm," and they have let themselves loose upon adulteration. Now we have had this question settled for all time. For the last few weeks we have had a Committee sitting upstairs upon a very interesting inquiry into this very subject. The hon. Member for North Longford (Mr. T. M. Healy) alarmed us last Session by declaring that the Irish people were being destroyed by drinking new whisky, and that fusel oil was the thing that did the harm; and he made a piteous appeal that whisky should be confined for two years in bond before being let out to do its work—that it should be an imprisoned spirit for that period. I am glad to say the House granted a Select Committee to inquire into this subject. It has been a most interesting inquiry; there have been experiments with fusel oil, with ether, with whisky one year old, two years, three years, five years old, and it is surprising that any of the Members of the Committee were sober at 3 o'clock. But one thing comes out of the inquiry without doubt—that fusel oil is not the criminal at all. It has been proved to demonstration by the right hon. Member for Leeds (Sir Lyon Playfair), who is

(2.14.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : The fact that there are three Local Veto Bills on the Paper today, one of which is an Irish Bill, is my excuse for intervening in this Debate. One of the first things which struck me this afternoon was that there was nothing Welsh in this Bill save its title. Its rejection was moved by a Member for a Metropolitan constituency, and seconded by a countryman of my own who sits for a Lancashire constituency; and I suppose, therefore, that it may be taken for granted that not a single Member from the Principality could be found courageous enough to face the undertaking of moving the rejection. I have listened to Debates on the temperance question for 26 years, and I never remember a Debate taking place in which the hon. Members who opposed these Bills did not rise and say that they were as much opposed to intemperance as those on this side of the House, and that it is not a Party question. While I have no doubt that hon. Members are sincere in making that statement, people outside the House see that these hon. Members do nothing to abate intemperance, and I am very much afraid that it has become recognised that the Liberals have become the party of temperance reform. Just as in the struggle in America against slavery the Republican Party became the Party of the Abolitionists, so when measures intended to abate the evils of intemperance come before this House hon. Members opposite are not keen to support them. I think that the arguments used by the noble Lord who moved the rejection of the Bill were more questions for discussion in Committee than arguments in connection with the Second Reading of a Bill. My noble Friend objected, for example, to the proposal for a two-thirds majority, and he objected to

*(12.35.)  MR. W. BOWEN ROWLANDS  (Cardiganshire) : I rise, Sir, to move that this Bill, which is to enable the owners and occupiers of Wales to have effectual control over the liquor traffic, be now read a second time. No one I suppose will care to deny that excessive indulgence in strong drink is an evil of gigantic proportions. The testimony of those best qualified to judge is unanimous. Medical men, men of the world, statesmen, philanthropists, Judges, and ministers of religion, are here agreed. The vice of intemperance stains our fair fame as a nation. It thwarts our remedial measures at home and brings discredit upon our best efforts abroad. Only a week or two ago Mr. Justice Hawkins, in some observations he made at the Reading Assizes, asserted that 80 out of every 100 prisoners brought up for trial assigned their fall to drink. It was stated in this House in April last, by the noble Lord the Member for Paddington, that it is difficult to over-estimate the evils which arise from the consumption of alcoholic drinks; and one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Georgia
 1291 1292 "The fatal facility of recourse to the public house makes it extremely difficult for multitudes of persons, in view of the hardship of their lives, to resist or avoid intemperance." 1293 1294 1295 Lancet "It is appalling to find that the drink bill of 1890 amounts to £139,495,470—an increase, all medical science and common sense notwithstanding. It is not our business to moralise on this expenditure. To us it means so much cirrhosis, Bright's disease, gout, rheumatism, insanity, &c, disabling employment, taking the pleasure out of the life of families, and bread out of the mouths of children." Breweries and Distilleries "On the face of it, it is not unfair that when you find a large and preponderating majority in a restricted area, who desire to live under conditions which in their belief conduce to order and morality, it is hard on such a majority that a comparatively small minority should be able to prevent their having their way; and what makes it especially hard in this case is that the power is a power which

Friend the Member for North St. Pancras (Mr. Lawson) will most ably represent the views of the London County Council on the subject; but I regret that we have had no opportunity of consulting our Colleagues as to the composition of a Committee in which the London County Council are so much interested.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : The measure is much desired by all classes.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : The Bill has the support of Members in all quarters of the House, and there is no reason why it should be opposed.
 *SIR J. GORST : The Secretary of State has no official information with regard to Captain Drury, who belongs to the 2nd, and not the 3rd Goorkhas. I have, however, observed from the reports in the ordinary channels of information that Captain Drury has been released.
 *SIR J. GORST : The answer to the first question of the hon. Member is in the affirmative. The answer to the second question is that it is not an  ex post facto
 MR. MAC NEILL  (Donegal, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether any, and, if so, what steps have been taken to recover a sum of £294 5s. improperly paid by the Accountant General of the Army to Messrs. Cox and Co., bankers, as commission to that firm in their capacity as agents of the East Surrey Regiment, which item has already formed the subject of a Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General; and whether any application has yet been made to Messrs. Cox and Co. for the recovery of the sum in question?
 MR. J. W. LOWTHER  (Cumberland, Penrith) : As I am only an intermittent reader of  Truth Daily Chronicle Daily News
 DR. CAMERON : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can give the House any information regarding the recent seizure of the steamship  Countess of Carnarvon
 SIR R. WEBSTER : In reply to the hon. Member's question, it is not possible for me to express any opinion as to the action of the Government until I have an opportunity of seeing any proposed Bill and considering the changes of the law there by effected. I am not, however, at present prepared to recommend any alteration of the law in the direction indicated by the hon. Member, although Her Majesty's Government are very desirous of encouraging the development of the mineral resources of Great Britain and Ireland.
(3.20.)  SIR W.HARCOURT  (Derby) . I wish to ask what course the Government propose to take with reference to these Amendments generally. With regard to the first Amendment, which has reference to writs of  habere facias possessionem 1441 1442
(6.20.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS  (Carnarvonshire, Eifion) : I wish to move the insertion of an Amendment after the word "lands," and my object is this: As has just been mentioned by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, occasionally there is land which at certain times of the year is bereft of all chattels on which distraint could be levied. It would be possible, if the words remain in the clause, for the tithe owner to drop upon these lands at that particular season when there would be no distraint available, and thereupon having proved to the Court that there had been an attempt to seize, but without avail, a writ of  habere facias possessionem 1460 habere facias possessionem
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACE : I do not want to detain the House on this subject. We think the Amendment is a fair one, and, therefore, we have accepted it.
(11.17.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS : It seems to me that the same arguments which support the principle of Clause 5 and the remission of tithe rent-charge where it exceeds two-thirds of the rent, equally apply against this clause. One object of the Bill, it has often been stated, is to prevent land being' thrown out of cultivation, and thus the Bill is in the interests of agriculture. But here is a case in which the land, having gone out of cultivation, or having no buildings, or standing in need of improvement without which it would not be possible it should be brought into cultivation—the land must be let at a nominal rent. Now, if it is right to remit tithe rent-charge where it exceeds two-thirds of the value of the property, equally then the tithe should be remitted in these cases I mention, or else the land will pass out of cultivation.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The Papers in question have been received, and are being most fully considered. They will be included in any correspondence which may be laid before Parliament on the subject.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The Land Commissioners report that the case referred to was dismissed by the Sub-Commission on the 8th May, 1890, on the ground that the tenant was not in  bonâ fide
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am sorry that I have not yet been able to obtain the information that would enable me to answer the question. The question only appeared on the Paper yesterday. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will put it down for Monday.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am informed that the facts are as stated in the first paragraph of the question, but it is probable that a decision will be pronounced early in April.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : As this question appears on to-day's Paper without previous notice, time has not admitted of my obtaining a detailed Report. But from available information it appears that there are 10 electoral divisions in the Dunfanaghy Union, and that for six of these loans have been sanctioned to purchase seed potatoes. I am not aware that the Rev. James M'Fadden repudiates the suggestion referred to. The Guardians, I understand, have summoned a special meeting for the 21st inst., at which applications for loans for seed from the remaining four electoral divisions will be considered. The general condition of the district is receiving careful attention.
(12.40.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The hon. and learned Member, in the lucid statement which he has just made to the House, has asked it to dissent from the opinion deliberately arrived at by the Privy Council of Ireland. What is his main reason for objecting to the scheme? It is that it makes no provision for the representation of the Board of Guardians on the Board of Management of the school. I should like to ask whether Boards of Guardians are in any way specially qualified to supervise educational institutions? To lay down that they are would be to establish a dangerous principle. The hon. and learned Member has, I think, missed the real point which influenced the Privy Council in coming to a decision. Under the will of Mr. Gilson the school is to be for the benefit both of Protestants and Catholics, and in order that their interests may be considered equally the will lays down that the management of the school shall be divided between Protestants and Catholics, and the institution is put under the control of the clergyman of the parish and of the priest. Some 30 years ago the question of the management was brought before the Court of Chancery in England, and the Court held that the representation on the Board of Management should be equal as between Roman Catholics and Protestants, adding as additional manager the Chief Secretary, who might or might not be a Protestant. Subsequently the Privy Council in Ireland came to the same conclusion. The plan advocated by the hon. and learned Member would probably give an absolute majority on the Board of Management to the Roman Catholics. This the hon. Member would probably justify by saying that the Roman Catholic population of the district is larger than the Protestant. No doubt it is, but it was so also at the time when the testator made his will and expressed his intentions. The only way to ensure fairness is by preserving the equal representation of both creeds upon the Board. If there is to be a permanent.
 1515
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : But that does not affect the head master. I hope the House will reject the Resolution moved by the hon. and learned Member. Considering that the Government have on their side the will of the testator and the opinion of the English Court of Chancery and of the Irish Privy Council, I hold distinctly that no sufficient grounds have been shown for departing from the practice which has hitherto prevailed.
 MR. BROOKFIELD  (Sussex, Rye) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether his attention has been called to an article appearing in the  Times 1424
 MR. BROOKFIELD : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the practice prevails in some parts of the United Kingdom of holding inquests as to the cause of fires which may have taken place; whether this practice has been attended with advantage in the City of London; and whether, in view of the large number of fires which now take place, he will carefully consider any measure which would require inquests to be held in all serious cases of fire throughout the Kingdom?
(9.52.)  MR. JEFFREYS  (Hants, Basingstoke) : We have heard a great deal about the yeoman farmer; but the fact is, that this clause does not apply to the yeoman farmer at all—it is entirely confined to the occupier. I confess, however, that I do not like the clause. The main feature of the Bill has hitherto been the transfer of the tithe from the occupier to the owner. We now find that under this clause where the tithe is not paid by the owner recourse is to be had to the occupier. I think it is a bad clause. I am sorry it has been introduced, and I think the Government would act wisely in rejecting it.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I understand that the proposal is to adjourn the consideration of this clause until after the other Amendments are disposed of. Such a. course is novel; but if it meet with the general consent of the House I will not, under the circumstances, object to it, provided the Motion is made by the Minister in charge and that it meets with the general assent of the House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : No doubt it would not be the proper Parliamentary course to refer at length to Debates in another place, but it may be necessary to refer in some form to a statement upon which an Amendment has been founded.
 *MR. SPEAKER : No, I did not say that, if the hon. Gentleman will excuse me for saying so. I did not say it would be irregular or unparliamentary; I said to follow in detail the arguments used in another place would be irregular, but to simply quote words used would be to quote the foundation of the Amendment.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Perhaps the two gentlemen who acted as Tellers for the Noes may be able to explain.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, but he has already spoken.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member has also spoken. I wish to point out to hon. Members that the proper time to move an Amendment is before I put the Question "That the House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment." Under the circumstances, I will regard the Question as not put.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member may oppose the Motion that the Lords' Amendment, as amended, be agreed to.
 *MR. BIRRELL  (Fife, W.) : I have to move an Amendment the object of which is simply to interfere with the rights of those persons who, being habitual drunkards, tramps, or beggars, have abandoned their children and allowed them to be brought up by other persons. The Amendment is as follows:—
 "Clause 3, page 1, line 28, after parent insert,' if it be proved that the parent is an habitual drunkard, a tramp, a beggar, or a frequenter of a common lodging-house, or casual ward, or.' " 1510
 *MR. BIRRELL : As the Attorney General cannot see his way to accepting my Amendment, I beg leave to withdraw it.
*(5.32.)  MR. C. T. DYKE ACLAND  (Cornwall, Launceston) : The noble Lord has omitted to observe one point in Clause 85 of the old Act. I think it is clear from the wording of that clause that the intention was that the person paying the tithe in respect of one holding should be one person only, and if a yeoman should be liable in respect of the whole of his occupation, though part of it might belong to another owner. What we are now discussing is his liability for tithe as a tenant only. The whole question now is whether the landlord shall have the power to recover the
 1452
*(5.17.)  MR. C. W. GRAY : If the right hon. Gentleman charges us with inconsistency in respect of certain changes made in the Bill, I would point out to him that to do so is to use a double-edged weapon. Several matters have been thought of by hon. Members since the Bill left this House, and we claim that if we see a point which is relevant to some Amendment coming from the other House, we have a perfect right to raise that point, although we may not have seen it when the Bill was discussed here before. As far as I can understand, we are asked to give the landlord exceptional powers. ["No!"] If we are not,
 1450
 *MR. C. W. GRAY : But the landlord is to have power not only to distrain on his own land, but also upon other land which the tenant may hold as a yeoman farmer; and if it is proposed to confer that power on the landlord, I shall do all I can to defeat it.
 "MR. C. W. GRAY  (Essex, Maldon) : I hope the House will disagree with this Amendment.
*(7.37.)  MR. C. W. GRAY : The proposal embodied in the Amendment of the President of the Board of Trade does not altogether meet the views of my friends and myself. The whole subject is so complicated that the more the House attempts to deal with it the more difficult it appears. At the earliest moment I shall move the rejection of the clause altogether, so that we may return to the position occupied when the House first went into Committee. I do not wish to be unfair either to the tithe owner or the tithepayer.
 *MR. C. W. GRAY : On a point of order, Sir, I wish to oppose the Lords' Amendment altogether; does that Question come later?
 *MR. C. W. GRAY : The hon. Member will excuse MR. I did not say they would be certain to do this; but I said I should not be surprised, if the day of reckoning should come, to find a considerable change in the feelings of the yeomen farmers on this subject.
(9.38.)  MR. C. W. GRAY : No one was more surprised than myself when I saw this clause introduced. I remember an Instruction of some three or four years age to the committee that
 1486
 *MR. RITCHIE : In the case of a person to whom relief has been granted by a Board of Guardians, the Guardians are not empowered to seize the furniture without any process of law. This is subject, however, to the enactment in the Poor Law Union Charges Amendment Act, 1849, under which in the case of a pauper dying and having in his possession or belonging to him any money or property, the Guardians of the union are empowered to reimburse themselves the expenses incurred by them in the burial of the pauper and in his maintenance at any time during the 12 months previous to the decease. I think that the Guardians under this enactment are empowered when they obtain possession of the furniture of a deceased pauper to sell it for the purpose of reimbursing themselves of the cost of his relief within the limitation referred to.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF the LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : I have communicated with the Vestry clerk on this subject, and have ascertained that at the meeting referred to a deputation of ratepayers attended, and made allegations to the effect stated in the question against the Committee of the Vestry, by whom the Valuation List for the parish was prepared. I am unable to say whether the figures in the list bear out these allegations, but I find that at the meeting the matter was referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry, and that this Committee have decided to recommend the Vestry to intimate to the deputation that the apparent anomalies to which attention has been called admit, in their opinion, of a legitimate and satisfactory explanation. Notice was given to each ratepayer of the amount at which it was proposed that he should be assessed, and if he was aggrieved by the list he could object before the Assessment Committee of the Guardians, and, if necessary, appeal against their decision. I am informed, however, that the appeals were not more numerous than at the previous quinquennial revision, and that the surveyor of taxes, who was present at each meeting of the Assessment Committee of the Vestry, did not lodge any objection to the figures entered in the list. The Local Government Board are not empowered to interfere in the matter.
 MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he can lay upon the Table of the House the replies by, and the criticisms of, the different Government Agents in Ceylon on the Report of the Select Committee which lately sat in that Island to consider the question of the Paddy Tax; and whether, in case these replies have not been brought to his notice, he will cause them to be laid before the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with the view of enabling him to come to a correct decision in the matter?
*(12.29.)  The UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam : This clause makes very little alteration in the law, and still less in the practice. It simply provides that the child shall be disposed of by enlistment or emigration at any time instead of having to wait 18 months, whereas under the present system the same result can at any time be obtained in proper cases by discharging the child. Such discharge is subject to the consent of the Secretary of State.
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : Will my right hon. Friend introduce a short Bill dealing with this subject?
*(12.25.)  MR. HOWARD VINCENT : I understood from what the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary said that it was not his intention to introduce a Bill.
 *MR. HOWARD VINCENT : I will not press the clause now, Sir, but will put it down on Report.
*(12.20.)  MR. HOWARD VINCENT  (Sheffield, Central) : I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will be able to accept the clause I have put on the Paper, because it would aid the management of industrial schools in placing out boys and freeing them from the evil influences of unworthy parents, who, having abandoned their children for many years, seek them out again for sordid reasons, with the result that the children frequently lapse again into crime.
 MR. HOWARD VINCENT : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when a Bill will be introduced to deal with some at least of the recommendations of the Select Committee on National Provident Insurance which reported in 1887, and on Friendly Societies which reported in 1889, with a view to the advancement of their great work?
 MR. HOWARD VINCENT  (Sheffield, Central) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education if he has given any effect to the recommendation of the Select Committee on Friendly Societies, which reported, in 1889, with regard to the introduction of the principle of popular insurance for sickness and old age as one of the subjects of general instruction under the direction of the Department; and, in the contrary case, if he will now do so?
(10.3.)  MR. WARMINGTON  (Monmouth, W.) : I was surprised to find this clause introduced in another place, and to hear an attempt to justify it here. If it is intended to aim it at conspiracy, why not state that on the face of the clause itself? If such a clause had been proposed by any Member on these benches when the Bill was in Committee in this House, I wonder what would have been said. Indeed, I think the authors of this clause altogether wrong the tenant farmer of Wales when they suggest he is willing to enter into a fraudulent conspiracy to prevent the tithe owner being paid. I pass that by; but let me ask the House to consider in how many cases this clause will work the grossest injustice. The person who proposed it certainly had the erroneous opinion in his mind that the occupier was the permanent holder of the land. We know, on the contrary, that he only occupies the land for a limited term. He may have a lease of the farm for seven years, and in the sixth year, if the tithe
 1491
(10.36.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I now propose to add a further Amendment. I think it has been assumed during the whole course of the discussion on the last Amendment that the landlord and tenant might enter into an agreement with the object of evading the operation of this Act, and the clause was inserted in order to meet such a case. It was inserted, first of all, at the suggestion of Members on this side of the House. It is fair in so far as it operates against any collusion between owner and occupier. The argument of the Attorney General in support of the clause was directed exclusively to such cases, and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Oxford (Mr. Talbot) supported the clause on that express and exclusive condition. I shall expect the support of the hon. Gentleman, in endeavouring to confine the operation of the clause to cases of collusion. There are cases in which a  bonâ fide
(9.7.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : The weakness of the defence of the Government on this clause is, that it assumes that the clause will only be applied to cases in which collusion exists between the landlords and tenants. That is not the case. It will affect persons who have entered into a perfectly  bonâ fide 1481 "If you will let me this land for, say, ten years, I will spend so much money, and at the end of the ten years I will pay so much rent." bonâ fide 1482
(6.41.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move to insert the words—
 "After notice given to and hearing of the owner and occupier of the said lands." ex parte habere facias possessionem ex parte 1462
(6.48.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I will withdraw my Amendment in favour of that of the hon. and learned Gentleman.
(11.36.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move to insert at the end of the clause the following words:—
 1505 "Provided also that this section shall not apply to cases where the contract of tenancy was entered into before the passing of this Act."
(5.27.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move the omission of the words "and eighty-five" so that I shall be in Order. I would point out that the Lords' Amendment would impose a practical hardship. A yeoman farmer may have contracted debts for seeds, manure, and stock, or may have borrowed capital to cultivate his own farm, giving a bill of sale. As a distraint for rent takes precedence of all other debts, the landlord would be able to distrain on the yeoman farmer's land in respect of tithe issuing from other land he holds under that landlord, and not only the yeoman farmer, but his creditors, would suffer. The effect of the section, if adopted, would be to discourage cultivation.
(4.54.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE  (Carnarvon) : I shall move the omission of the words "has contracted," and the insertion of words to make the clause read as follows: "Which such occupier is liable under the said contract to pay."
 MR. DONAL SULLIVAN  (Westmeath, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland has his attention been drawn to the fact that the appeal in the case of Thomas Metcalfe, tenant, Graves Cathrew, landlord, union of Baltinglass, County Wicklow, from the dismiss of his originating notice served 29th September, 1887, by order of 21st March 1890, has not yet been heard, and when it is likely to come on?
*(12.30.)  MR. KNOX ( Cavan, W. : I rise to move—
 "That an humble Address he presented to Her Majesty, praying Her to withhold Her consent from a Scheme for the management of the Gilson Schools, Oldcastle, County Meath, provisionally approved by the Lords Justices in Council on the 13th November, 1890, unless provision be made in the Scheme for the representation of the Board of Guardians of the Oldcastle Union upon the Governing Body of the said Schools." 1513
 *MR. KNOX : Special provision is made that one of the masters shall be a Protestant.
 *MR. KNOX : But I have it here.
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he can state if there is an early prospect of the negotiations between the Scotch Office, the Treasury, the Scottish Fishery Board, and the Public Works Loan Commission with regard to a further advance of £10,000 for the completion of Eyemouth Harbour being satisfactorily concluded, so that the necessary works may be now contracted for by the Harbour Trustees and carried into effect during the coming summer?
 MR. MARJORIBANKS : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether it is the fact that the bolt-head of the magazine rifle placed by the Government at the United Service Institution has broken down; and, if so, what is the exact nature of the accident, and to what causes is it to be attributed; whether he will give directions for a rifle of the Mark II. pattern to be placed at the United Service Institution; and
 1430
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The bolt-head of the magazine rifle at the United Service Institution has been broken by the unnecessary violence of a workman. I am not prepared to issue a rifle of Mark II. to the Institution at present. As regards the third question, I will explain privately to the right hon. Gentleman what has been done, but it is not a question which it is desirable to answer in the House.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The question is under my consideration, but I cannot say what the decision will be.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : Certainly not.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : These torpedoes are for coast defence. My hon. and gallant Friend will scarcely expect a reply to the remainder of his question.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The recent competition for the supply of drugs and medicines had reference to the whole Army, including the Force in Ireland. The contract for the supplies in Ireland, estimated at about £1,700 a year, will, as a result of the competition, remain with the Apothecaries Hall at Dublin.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : It is not usual to make disallowances beyond the period for which accounts are open. The circumstances of this peculiar case will be fully explained to the Committee on Public Accounts.
 MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether it is competent for a bankrupt, whether discharged or undischarged, to act as trustee of charity lands; and whether a churchwarden, who is  ex officio
(10.0.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : I think the right hon. Gentleman is under a misapprehension; but even at this, the eleventh hour, it is not too late for him to alter his mind. The only voice raised in support of this clause has been that of the hon. Member for Shropshire, for even the hon. Member for
 1490
(9.31.)  MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S E.) : I think the hypothetical case put by the Attorney General is hardly sufficient to justify the introduction of this clause. I always understood that the great redeeming points of the Bill
 1485
 MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S.E.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty what is the limit of age for admission at
 1419
(5.37.)  CAPTAIN BETHELL  (York, E.R., Holderness) : May I ask whether there is no distinction between this case and the case of a landlord who distrains on his tenant in the ordinary way? If the landlord is to be allowed to distrain on the land of a yeoman I would point out that the tithe upon that land will probably have already been paid. I should be very much indisposed to support this Amendment of the Lords in any case; but if the view I take of the matter is the correct one, I shall certainly not support the Amendment.
(6.49.)  CAPTAIN BETHELL : The Amendment says the writ of  habere facias possessionem
 MR. GOSCHEN : My Minute showing the results of the inquiry is in print and undergoing its final revise, I hope it may be published in a very short time.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : If there were other Joint Stock Banks with capitals of £16,000,000 sterling, and if the Bank of England were unreasonable, the question of competition might arise, but I do not believe in the double event.
 MR. GOSCHEN : It is true that a public-spirited gentleman has offered £80,000 to build an Art Gallery on a site at South Kensington; but with regard to the further points raised by the hon. Member, I may say at once that the offer only affects about one-tenth of the land recently bought by Government, and the remainder would still be left avail-
 1425
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : My hon. and gallant Friend must be aware that one of the chief recommendations of the Select Committee which reported in 1887 as to the payment of a contribution towards a superannuation fund by persons in the Public Service has already been given effect to by the Police Act, 1890, and the Police (Scotland) Act, 1890, under which Statutes rateable deductions from pay are carried to the Police Pension Fund. The Committee reported, however, that they—
 "Were disposed to wait for the further development of public opinion… before advising the adoption of a general obligatory system of superannuated pay."
 *MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : I am glad to find from what the right hon. Gentleman has just said that he admits the existence of what I regard as a distinct understanding come to in this House when the matter was before it. It would appear that the real object of the Lords was to disguise the payment of an unpopular charge.
*(5.20.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : It seems to me that the power which is conferred on the landlord is unjust, and the fact that it is conferred by the Act of 1836 does not make it less unjust. I shall certainly support the hon. Member's Amendment.
*(4.38.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : What is the object of leaving out these words?
*(8.59.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : It is certainly a singular thing that this blot in the Bill was not discovered in the passage of the Bill through the House before it went to another place.
 1479
*(11.50.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : This clause is so mischievous that I welcome any Amendment that will mitigate it. The right hon. Gentleman said that under the law as it stood the tenant was liable for these payments. No doubt that is so, but under the Bill we are making a new departure. The Bill transfers the burden from the shoulders of the tenant to those of the landlord, and at the same time this clause imposes a distinction which has never existed before. The Amendment proceeds on an intelligible basis—one recognised over and over again in the House—namely, that there is a distinction between prospective and retrospective legislation.
*(10.58.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : I hope my hon. Friend will press this Amendment to a Division, because I think it puts the saddle on the right horse. The Attorney General has shifted his ground, and says that the clause is intended to apply to  bonâ fide 1499
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will allow other London Joint Stock Banks to tender for the business of Her Majesty's Government as well as the Bank of England?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether, under the new postal system, announced in the morning papers of last Saturday, the Post Office propose to exclusively work the call system, or whether it is proposed that this system shall be worked by companies or persons under licences from the Post Office?
 MR. COBB : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that without a licence to use the call system the other business of these companies could not be carried on profitably, or indeed at all?
 MR. COBB : Will the right hon. Gentleman also consider this fact. The District Messengers Company are now working the call system under a promise of a licence, and the other company have applied for a similar licence. Will the right hon. Gentleman take that question into consideration and make an arrangement?
 MR. COBB : Will the right hon. Gentleman say how many persons are now in prison for contempt of Court
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he is aware that, at a large meeting of the St. James' Vestry held on 5th March, a numerous deputation of ratepayers attended as to the assessments made by the Assessment Committee, and a long debate took place; whether he is aware that it was alleged, and figures quoted to prove, that the assessments upon premises occupied by many members of the Committee had been lowered or kept at the same amount, while the assessments of adjoining or neighbouring premises, not occupied by members of the Committee, had been raised; whether the figures shown in the Valuation List books bear out this allegation; and whether he will cause an inquiry to be made, with a view to putting an end to the dissatisfaction which exists among many of the leading ratepayers in the parish?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Homo Department whether he will give a Return, if moved for, of the names of the persons who were on the 1st January, 1891, in prison for contempt of Court, with the respective dates of their committal and the nature of their offence?
 MR. H. R. FARQUHARSON  (Dorset, W.) : I think the landlords suffer so-many injustices under this Bill that an extra one more or less will not make much difference. But the small yeomen of the country will be immensely surprised if they find landlords can not only distrain upon their own property, but also upon the yeoman's property. If any landlord sitting upon the Conservative side of the House made such a proposition, it would be a very remarkable thing if he found his way to-the House again, supposing he had a single yeoman in his constituency. There will be endless complications-Who is going to say which is the tithe and which the rent? Take the case of a man paying £100 a year for rent and tithe. Suppose he has paid £75 on. account and the landlord says, "The £25 balance is tithe, and I am going to" distrain on your freehold for it." The tenant will say, "Not a bit of it; one of the three £25 which made up the £75 was for tithe, and therefore you cannot distrain upon my land." I believe if this Amendment is not carried it will give rise to endless difficulties, the presence of which will afford solid ground for the landlords looking to the-House for compensation in respect of its-action in the matter.
(10.59.)  MR. H. R. FARQUHARSON : I am quite aware where the idea of collusion came in. The very foundation of this Amendment in the Upper House was the idea of collusion. So long as I believe that the clause is aimed purely at collusion I have no objection to it, except that I consider it to be a great insult to the landowners and tenant-farmers of the country. Now, however, it is clear that it is aimed at other cases. I can give two very common cases in which it will prevent landlords getting tenants at all. In the first place, there are innumerable cases where landlords let their farms during the first few years at very small rents. That is often owing to the foulness of the land or other circumstances. Sometimes a tenant will not take land at a low rent if he has to pay the tithe upon it. Then, again, in the case of buildings or improvements, these a tenant may contract to construct on condition of a low rent; this will be put an end to if the tenant is under this liability. The tithe owner will be the gainer by an arrangement of the kind, for if buildings are erected and improvements made the certainty and regularity of the payment of tithe is assured. I hope the Government will agree to define the clause so that it shall deal only with cases of collusion, and if it is so confined it will not be put in force so long as landlords and tenants exist on their present relations.
(9.1.)  MR. H. R. FARQUHARSON : If there is anyone who will be tired of these Debates, I should think it will be the poor clergyman, who is trotted out on every possible occasion. The Attorney General has once again appealed to our sympathy on his behalf. It seems to me that such appeals betoken a very weak case, because the poor clergymen for whom the Attorney General pleads belong to the richest Church in the world, and it is ridiculous to suppose that the members of that Church would allow a clergyman to starve for the sake of £10 a year. The Government have, in effect, said: "The clergy are very poor fellows; help them out of the landlords' pockets." I object to that. The clergy are practically being helped, to the disadvantage of the landlords, and for the very reason that landlords are no longer to be allowed to let their farms to the best advantage. I have no doubt there are thousands of instances in the country where landlords have let their farms for 7, 10, and 14 years, on the understanding that for the first few years the rent shall be low, and higher in future years. If this Amendment from the Lords becomes law, it will be no longer possible for a needy landlord to so let his farms. Indeed, he will have taken away from him the only possible means of letting his farms at all. Again, some landlords let farms at a low rent in consideration of the tenant putting up buildings. It is said this should not be allowed; but it seems to me that if the land is of so little value, that the reduced rent con sequent on building's being put up by

(6.56.)  MR. H. R. FARQUHARSON : I have an Amendment on the Paper, but I do not think it will be necessary for me to move it, as I believe the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade proposes an alteration which will remove my objection. It does not altogether satisfy me, but it is sufficiently satisfactory to render it, unnecessary for me to go on with my Amendment.
(12.26.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I did not say it was not my intention, but that at the Home Office we are so overwhelmed with work that it is difficult to find an opportunity of pushing forward the Bill.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I do not think it would be possible to introduce a Bill dealing alone with the disposal of children.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I will obtain the information if the hon. Gentleman requires it.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am not aware that this practice prevails elsewhere than in the City of London, where, as my hon. Friend is aware, it is authorised by a Private Act passed in 1888. Thirty-eight cases have been reported to me under this Act. In 30 cases the jury found the cause of the fire unknown; in seven cases they found that the cause was accidental; and in one case that the fire was caused by an unknown incendiary. I am informed, however, by the authorities of the City that in their belief the power to hold fire inquests acts as a deterrent against arson and fraud on Insurance Companies; and I am
 1426
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am disposed to think that it will not be possible to find time for the Consolidation Bill on betting and gambling in the present Session, which is already too full. There are other measures prepared in the Home Office which are more urgent than the Bill to which my hon. Friend refers, and for which time may not improbably be wanting. I will, however, not lose sight of the subject.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The Prison Authorities inform me that they have no means of supplying information as to the "nature" of the contempt of Court in the several cases; and I see no public advantage in giving the names of persons in such a Return. I am, therefore, unable to assent to this Return.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Board of Inland Revenue that the latest statistics at present prepared in regard to on-licences in England and Wales are those which the hon. Member will find in Appendix XI. of the 33rd Report of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I have not

 *MR. RAIKES : I do not know anything of the profits of the company. My business is to give effect to the law.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to say that I am not in a position to authorise the giving of receipts for telegrams without charge. As I have already announced in this House, I have considered the question of reducing the charge, but the Government did not see their way to agree to any reduction.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am prepared to take into consideration any operations of the company outside that part of it which is within the jurisdiction of the Post Office; but no promise of a licence to any of these companies can be made for any business which is proper to the Post Office.
 *MR. RAIKES : The companies which have engaged in this business have done so under express warnings from the Department that their business was illegal, and the warnings have been repeated in each case. As to how far a system of electric call may be applied to other business that docs not fall properly within the business of the Department. I should be glad to consider what course the Department can take in regard to it.
 *MR. RAIKES : If the hon. Gentleman had listened to my answer he would have known that I have just answered that question. The business of the Department relates to the delivery of letters and messages.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to say that it is not proposed to grant licences for the electric call system, and the Post Office will be prepared itself to meet the demands of the public in this matter.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : In reply to the noble Lord, I have to say that the Post Office will be prepared to supply electric call apparatus, but that a charge must necessarily be made for it. I do not suppose that the District Messengers Company can have had the intention of providing any such gratuitous service to the public as the noble Lord suggests, although it is not impossible that temporary advantages of this sort may

*(12.58.)  MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : As I have had a good deal to do with schemes of this nature, I may, perhaps, be permitted to intervene in this Debate. As I understand the question, this testator lived 80 years ago, and the point is not what were his wishes in regard to this Charity, but what is the best scheme for administering the Charity now. I submit it is altogether out of place for the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary to rest upon a Judgment of the Court of Chancery delivered 30 years ago. One of the main objects of the Endowed Schools Act was to get rid of the intervention of the Court of Chancery so as to entrust the localities specially interested with the duties of dealing with them. Is it not a reasonable and natural thing that the people of the district most affected should have a voice in the government of the schools? In many cases endowed schools may be a curse rather than a blessing to the place—a curse if they are not conducted according to the best spirit of the time. I do hope the House will assent to this Motion, because, whilst it gives, to my mind, too limited an amount of popular government, it at any rate proposes to give some. It also provides that the institution shall be carried on largely in accordance with the intentions of the founder, and, as far as I can see, there is nothing in the scheme which is at all contrary to the will. It is in accordance with the principle which Parliament has over and over again acted upon. I hope the House will assent to the Motion.
*(9.33.)  MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : I have listened, as far as I can, to the cases which have been put forward, and I find they are three in number. One refers to derelict estates, which cannot come under the clause at all. They will be put out by the 5th clause, which says that if the tithe exceeds two-thirds of the annual value then it shall be reduced in proportion. Secondly, as to cases of collusion between landlord and tenant to avoid the tithe rent-charge, this clause would only govern contracts made before the passing of the Act, and could not therefore include cases of collusion. Again, if there are cases of collusion, why in the world should you fall upon the occupier rather than upon the owner? One will probably have received something in the nature of rent, and upon him the burden ought to lie. The other case was that put by the hon. Member for Mid Glamorgan, of a tenant having taken a farm for a considerable period of time on the understanding that he was to lay out a considerable amount upon it. To make the occupier pay in such a case would be contrary to the very purpose and object of the Bill. The original Act of 1836 enabled the landlord to pay through the occupier. The remedy proposed by this Bill is to throw the payment on the landlord; yet, in a case where the occupier has been laying out money upon the estate, you actually say that he shall pay the tithe rent-charge, and not the landlord, and shall have his chance of recovering from the landlord. I have not heard a single case in which it would be be reasonable to get this money from the occupier. I think the Government must in all fairness see that, in accordance with the very object of their own Bill, they ought to endeavour to discover some means by which to put it upon the owner directly; and if they can devise no better means, let them accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for Mid Glamorgan.
(9.45.)  MR. H. GARDNER : Whoever is responsible for this clause, whether the Government' or Lord Selborne, has framed it in a very singular way, because those who pose as friends of the farmers and the agricultural interest are supporting it solely on the assumption that the whole of the farmers and landlords of this country desire to enter into a fraudulent conspiracy to defraud the tithe owners. They suppose that labouring as the farmers do in all parts of the country, and especially in my own Division, under the effects of long-continued agricultural depression, they are ready to pay large sums of money to their landlords, and in collusion with them, for the simple purpose of defrauding the tithe owners of what is their just due. It seems to me that the proposal is preposterous. In previous Debates on this unfortunate Bill I warned the House that if it did not consider the interests of the tithe payers the day would come when the Tory tenant and yeomen farmers of England would find themselves in line—shoulder to shoulder—with those who are helping forward the disestablishment of the Church. When I made that statement it was received with derision; bat from the speech of my hon. Colleague opposite, it would appear that the words I then uttered were the absolute truth, which is now proved up to the hilt. If the Government rashly persist in bolstering up the tithe owners by clauses such as this, the farmers who have hitherto in the main supported the Tory Party will certainly at no distant day take action with those who seek the disestablishment of the Church.
 MR. H. GARDNER : What the hon. Member says bears out what I have already stated, that the yeomen farmers will on occasion find themselves on the same side as those who are opposed to the Church Establishment. The right hon. Gentleman opposite occupies a position on this question which, with all due respect, I venture to regard with pity. He must have been greatly irritated by the stringent criticisms
 1488
(11.13.)  MR. H. GARDNER : I confess I am entirely in a fog as to what the Government intend by the clause, because we are told in the first place by no less an authority than the Prime Minister, and I imagined the same from the introductory remarks of the President of the Board of Trade, that it was intended to prevent a fraudulent conspiracy between owner and tenant to defraud the tithe owner of his just and legitimate debt. But the Attorney General just now told us this was not the only
 1503
(11.52.)  MR. H. GARDNER : I think that the argument that a tenant should not be called upon to undertake a contract by which he will be under an obligation he by no means foresaw is one which requires some reply from the Government. I understood that this is a measure, the primary intention of which is to make the owner responsible, and not the occupier, and that in no contemplated case is the occupier to be in any way responsible for the payment of tithe rent-charge. This unhappy clause does place on the occupier a liability which has never been contemplated by the Bill, and I trust that my hon. Friend will press his very reasonable Amendment.
 MR. H. GARDNER : Not against collusion only, but it "was also to meet  bonâ fide
 MR. H. GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he is aware that it is the custom of Boards of Poor Law Guardians, by their relieving officers, to enter without process of law the dwelling houses of persons who have received union relief, and to remove and sell the furniture and other goods of such persons, and apply the proceeds towards the costs of their relief; and whether such practice is within the competence of Poor Law Guardians; and, if not, whether he will direct a Circular to be issued to Boards of Guardians pointing out the illegality of such proceedings?
(5.24.)  MR. H. GARDNER : I would point out to the hon. Member that this proposal vitally touches the interests of the occupiers, and hon. Gentlemen opposite who are concerned in this question purely from the agricultural point of view will vote with us on this occasion.
 MR. H. GARDNER : For my part, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will adhere to the statement he has just made, and not insist upon the Lords' Amendment.
(4.51.)  MR. H. GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give some explanation of this. I may be very obtuse, but I think this is a very complicated Amendment, and as we have only had it in our hands a few hours it is necessary for us to call on the right hon. Gentleman to explain the effect. I may be told that if I had followed the Debates in the other House I should have been able to understand; but I am not a frequent visitor to that place, nor do I carefully study the reports of its proceedings. If the right hon. Gentleman will give us some explanation I am sure the House will be much obliged.
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of certain disputed points in the law of Malta, which, as he recently stated, Her Majesty has been advised to make, is intended to be made by Her Majesty under the Act 3 & 4 Will. IV., c. 41, s. 4; or, if not, under what statute; and whether the Government will consider the propriety of advising Her Majesty to refer to the Judicial Committee under the above statute, or in such other way as may be legal and proper, the question of law as to the eligibility of Roman Catholics to the offices of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Chancellor of Great Britain?
 MR. BRYCE : I beg to give notice that after Easter I will again ask the first part of the question.
 MR. J. M. MACLEAN : Sir C. Forster voted in the House without going into the Lobby.
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that the Guardian of the Meenacladdy Electoral Division in Gweedore is a commercial traveller residing at Belfast; that one of the Guardians of the Magheraclogher Division in Gweedore is non-resident; that the Guardian of the Gweedore portion of the Dunlewey Electoral Division is non-resident; that the Guardian of the Gweedore portion of the Gortahork Electoral Division is nonresident; and that only one Guardian is resident, who is a land agent, and has no interest or concern with any electoral division but his own; and, consequently, the Poor Law Board is composed of representatives of the landlord interest; whether he is aware that Father M'Fadden repudiates the suggestion that he advised the people not to purchase seed, but that, on the contrary, he carefully explained to them the necessary procedure for obtaining seed, and in every way manifested a deep interest in the matter; whether, having regard to the constitution of the Board of Guardians, he can take any steps to secure to the district the benefits of the Seed Potato Act, of which they are now deprived; and whether he will take into consideration the great and widespread distress prevailing in the

 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether it is the intention of the War Office to throw open for public competition the contracts for the supply of pure drugs and medicines to the military hospitals in Ireland, in the same way as similar contracts are in England; and, if not, will he explain on what grounds?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that great distress prevails in the parishes of Kiltimagh and Kilkelly, in the County of Mayo; whether it is his

 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I will repeat it on Monday.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : The Exhibitors' Club is a regularly constituted club, the members being exhibitors, attendants and other persons connected with the Exhibition. The Club has premises within the Exhibition buildings; and refreshments, including excisable liquors, are sold by the Club to its members and their guests in the manner usual in clubs. There is nothing illegal in this; and the fact that the Magistrates refused a certificate for licence for the sale of excisable liquors to the public in the Exhibition in no way prejudices the question.
 MR. TUITE  (Westmeath, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware of the fact that the judicial rents in the cases of Philip Brady, Charles Fagan, and Anne Cooney, tenants, Captain Gerald Dease, landlord, heard at the sitting of the Westmeath Land Sub-Commission, held at Mullingar, 29th October, 1890, have not yet been fixed; and can he state the cause of the delay, and when the decisions may be expected?
 SIR J. COLOMB  (Tower Hamlets, Bow, &c.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when the results of the recent inquiry held by him respecting the Outdoor Officers of Customs will be published?
*(12.51.)  SIR J. POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : We have been told by the right hon. Gentleman that it was the wish of the testator that the managers of this Charity should be equally divided, so far as religious opinions are concerned. But the right hon. Gentleman did not quote the will of the testator, and he has given us no authority whatever for that statement; but has only said what he believes to have been the wish of the testator. But I find in the opinion recorded by Lords Justices FitzGibbon and Naish a very different view, for they declare that "equal denominational representation was not provided for by the founder in his will, or by the present Chancery Scheme." Therefore, the view of my hon. Friend (Mr. Knox) was correct, while the Chief Secretary is mistaken in his idea of the will. But the statement of the right hon. Gentleman threw light on something more important; it threw light on the intentions of the Government with regard to Irish Local Government, and on this point we shall have something to say on a future occasion.
 MR. KEAY : When will the Indian Councils Bill be taken?
 MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I beg to ask the hon. Member for Penrith (Mr. J. W. Lowther) whether his attention has been called to articles in  Truth Daily Chronicle Daily News 1423
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I hope the Attorney General will accept an Amendment I have to propose in line 24. There are thousands of cases in which pauper children are brought up from an early age by Boards of Guardians and boarded out. The object of the Amendment is to restrict the power of parents to take away these children at the age of 12 and 13 from the schools in which they are learning some useful trade in order that they may make a

 *MR. J. G. TALBOT : I rise to order, Sir. I understand you to say, Sir, that it would be out of order to quote words used in Debate in another place, though an hon. Member has a right to refer to arguments used.
*(9.56.)  MR. J. G. TALBOT  (Oxford University) : I cannot help thinking that the Government would do well to adhere to the clause as it has come from the other House. Its main object is to prevent anything like collusion between owner and occupier. We have heard a good deal about bolstering up the tithe owner. I confess that I do not exactly understand what that means, because whilst in many cases the tithe owner is the clergyman of the parish, in others he is a layman, and the tithe is admitted to be in the nature of a property. This being so, whoever is the owner of the tithe has a right to it as his property, and has a right to have that property preserved. To preserve that right is the only object of this clause; it may be that it is not worded in the way hon. Gentlemen opposite desire, but its object certainly is to preserve the right to property which is legitimately owned. If the ownership of this property should be transferred to the nation it would be found that the nation would prove a harder taskmaster than the present tithe owner. The clause gives the tithe owner no new right, and if anyone could show that it did confer a right which the tithe owner does not now possess that would be a strong argument against it. With regard to what has been said of the occupier, the liability to the tithe which rests on the owner will, under this clause, should the occupier prove to be  pro hac vice
 MR. J. WILSON  (Lanark, Govan) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether he is aware that excisable liquors are sold in the Exhibitors' Club, within the Glasgow East End Exhibition; whether he is aware that a licence was refused by the Magistrates when the Exhibition was opened; and whether the sale of liquor in such circumstances is illegal?
 MR. BEAUFOY  (Lambeth, Kennington) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has received any information as to the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Keeble in Tonquin in January last; and, if so, whether any steps have been taken to bring their murderers to justice?
 MR. MARK STEWART  (Kirkcudbright) : I beg to ask the Secretary of

 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The House will recollect that when this clause was considered and a proviso inserted on the Motion of the hon. Member for Norfolk, I undertook that the omission of the proviso should be moved in another place in order to give an opportunity of considering the matter. One point included in the proviso was that where the tenancy terminates on March 25 or September 29, and the occupier is under a contract to pay the tithe which falls due on April 1 or October 1, he is not to be relieved of his liability to pay up to those dates, notwithstanding the expiry of his tenancy, and the omission of the words now proposed to be omitted will make this clear.
*(4.26.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I hope the House will not be disposed to enter on this question into a general discussion of the Lords' Amendments, for I think the House will see that such a course would not be in accordance with the usual practice. But I am far from complaining of the course taken by the right hon. Gentleman in asking what the intentions of the Government are with regard to the three principal Amendments. The right hon. Gentleman says that the Government are not themselves responsible for these Amendments. I think they are all due to a noble and learned Lord, who has hitherto been spoken of in this House with the respect due to him, until the right hon. Gentleman—an old Colleague—compared him to a certain personage of whom the less that is said the better. The Amendments were introduced by Lord Selborne, and I think the House will be disposed to consider that they come from one who has given special attention to a subject of which he is practically master. With regard to the first Amendment to which the right hon. Gentleman calls attention, I cannot quite accept the account which the right hon. Gentleman has given of the action of the Government in this matter. The proposal which was made for an Amendment practically to the same effect was not in Committee, but on Report. That proposal was withdrawn in accordance with the general wish of the House; and
 1443 1444
*(4.53.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The intention of the Amendment is obvious.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The only effect of the omission of the words will be to make the tenants liable in cases where the tithe falls due only a few days after the expiry of his tenancy.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I hope the hon. Member will not press that.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I would point out to the House that the Amendment was inserted on the Motion of no less an authority than Lord Herschell, whom I certainly should prefer to the hon. Member for Glamorganshire (Mr. S. Evans). I do not think, however, that
 1447
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I think the House will see that the hon. Member proposes to deprive the landlord of a part of his right. The hon. Member wishes that the landlord should not have the power formerly conferred upon the tithe owner. That is contrary to the position we have always taken up. We did not accept the suggestion made in the other House of increasing that right by giving the landlord the same right of recovery in the case of tithe rent-charge as in the case of rent. I would ask the House to sustain us in the position we have assumed from the beginning of the Bill.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Yes.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am willing to do so.
*(5.52.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I cannot quite accept the theory that the right hon. Gentleman is so ignorant that he did not appreciate what has been done. Let me point out what the House will do if they agree to the omission of Section 85. Section 81 limits the power of distraint to land liable to the payment of any tithe-rent charge. The only lands thus liable to the particular tithe rent-charge are lands upon which the par-
 1456
*(6.11.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The hon. Member for Mid Glamorgan has given notice of an Amendment to this proviso, but I think I can meet what he wants by the Amendment, a copy of which I have placed in his hands. What I propose is to leave but the words in the beginning of the proviso down to the word "court" in the second line, and insert—
 "If the Court is satisfied that the officer would find no distress, or not sufficient distress-on the said lands, the Court "—
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : My suggestion was to meet the point the hon. Member desired to raise. I do not desire any alteration.
*(10.33.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The right hon. Gentleman complains that I did not address to the House a social and political argument on the Amendment of the hon. Member for Mid Glamorgan (Mr. S. Evans). It appeared to me that my hon. and learned Friend the Attorney General had adequately and sufficiently dealt with the subject already. The right hon. Gentleman has entered on this Amendment, as he often has done on other Amendments, upon the principle of the clause. I decline to follow the right hon. Gentleman into his argument on that point. If it has to be re-argued another opportunity will arise He is very hard to please. If we had resisted the Amendment the right hon. Gentleman was, I think, prepared to denounce us for not giving the tenant a proper mode of recovery. As we accepted it, the right hon. Gentleman denounces us for imposing a personal liability on the landlord. We innocently thought that in this matter we were meeting an argument the right hon. Gentleman had himself addressed to the House. The right hon. Gentleman said a little time ago—
 1495
*(7.43.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I had hoped my suggestion would have met with general acceptance, as it would not have placed any hon. Member in a worse position; but as there seems to be a determination on both sides not to accept the clause in its present form, time may be saved by disagreeing with it forthwith. This course will be adopted by the Government, but only on the complete understanding that we are free as to the course we may adopt in regard to the subject both here and in the other House.
*(6.25.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The hon. Member proposes to throw a very difficult duty on the Court in requiring it to decide on a matter of probability. The Court can only decide on the matter of fact whether there was an absence of distress. Moreover, the hon. Member assumes most extraordinary conduct on the part of the tithe owner when he supposes he will act, as is suggested, for the sake of annoying the tithepayer. The object of the tithe owner is to get his tithe paid, and therefore he will not levy his distress at a time when he knows there is nothing to distrain upon. It is not reasonable to suppose the tithe
 1461
*(7.30.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The Government fully appreciate the difficulty
 1470
*(6.19.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Surely we can come to an agreement on this, which is merely a verbal Amendment, and then come to the main Question.
*(11.40.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I cannot understand the arguments in favour of this proposition. I can see no reason in justice why any difference should be made between the two classes
 1506
 ADMIRAL MAYNE  (Pembroke and Haverfordwest) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War how many Brennan torpedoes are now constructed, how many is it proposed to construct, and what it is proposed to do with them when constructed?
 ADMIRAL MAYNE : Will the right hon. Gentleman state the number?
 MR. WEBSTER  (St. Pancras, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he can state the number of electors who voted in Parliamentary Elections as illiterates, and their percentage to the total vote, from the conclusion of the General Election, 1886, to the end of February, 1891?
*(12.27.)  MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : There is no doubt that the power asked for by this clause is very much required, because of the way in which wretched parents get hold of their children after they have left the industrial school and drag them again down to vice. If the Industrial Schools Bill is brought in I shall support this clause—that is, if it cannot be adopted now.
(9.16.)  MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON  (Shropshire, Oswestry) : I deny that there is any hardship to the occupier involved in the Lords' Amendment. What is proposed is in operation now in the case of the Landlords' Income Tax. The tenant is the man upon whom the officers of Her Majesty's Revenue come down and insist upon paying the Landlords' Income Tax. The tenant is the only man who can be forced to pay in the first instance, and the remedy which the tenant has is precisely the remedy which is given to the occupier in this. Bill. A tenant has a right to deduct the Landlord's Income Tax from the rent he pays, and if the landlord declines to acknowledge the debt he is liable to a fine of £100. A similar state of things is proposed in the case of tithe. Where is the hardship to the occupier? He will have his remedy against the landlord. The section is intended to provide against collusion. There are no doubt landlords who will endeavour to evade the payment of the tithe rent-charge, and the method suggested seems to me an excellent one to frustrate any such unlawful endeavour.
*(8.46.)  MR. STUART RENDEL : It cannot but be matter of regret to some of us that a question we regard as of much greater importance than other questions dealt with earlier in the evening should have come on for discussion in a very thin House. We have had the advantage of a full explanation of the Government view from the Attorney General, and he has courteously challenged us to meet him in argument, only stipulating that we should not depart from the case he has put before us.
 *MR. STUART RENDEL : The Attorney General has stipulated that we should keep strictly to the case he has submitted, and I will endeavour to do so. This lacuna in the Government measure has been discovered by my hon. Friend (Mr. S. T. Evans), whose grasp of the whole subject has been admitted by the House, and we have to consider the Government proposal to fill it under the disadvantage of having been able to give only scant attention to the proposal. Now, why is it that the Attorney General assumes that exceptional security is required in the circumstances of land, the rent of which has been paid by premium, and is not payable year by year; and why, if there is to be this extra security for the tithe owner, is the occupier to be at the cost of it? I do not know whether the Attorney General would like an innocent layman to suppose that any legal liability for tithe rests upon the occupier, that the occupier under any circumstances is to be a guarantor of the tithe on behalf of the owner? The occupier surely is no more bound to take cognizance, whether the tithe is paid or not by the landowner, than he is bound to take cognisance whether the landowner has paid his Land Tax or any other of his personal liabilities? I do not think that it is sufficient argument to use now to say that the occupier should bear the brunt of this. That there are tithe owners in circumstances of great distress, that there are, as the hon. and learned Gentleman says, parsons in circumstances that excite our sympathy, may be true—and we cannot but consider that these circumstances reflect the greatest discredit upon the landed class in Wales on whose behalf the system exists; but why the occupier should be held responsible in this case I cannot understand, unless it comes from old traditional usage which made the occupier liable for the tithe. No doubt, in the operation of the Act of 1836, the occupier has been largely held liable where he ought not to have been, and the single merit of the present measure is that the occupier is relieved from this liability. It seems to me that it is a contradiction of the general spirit of the measure to attempt to treat the tenant as an additional security for tithe. To take the kind of example cited by the Attorney General—an occupier who

*(5.35.)  MR. STUART RENDEL.  (Montgomeryshire) : I can assure the noble Lord opposite that we entirely acquit him of the charge that he never rises to speak except in the interests of" the Church. We admit that he occasionally speaks in the interest of the landlord. I think that on the present occasion he has transferred his advocacy from the Church to the landlord, because I understood him to say that he thought it obviously just that any power the tithe owner might have for the recovery of the tithe should now be vested in the landlord as against anybody else. I cannot realise the justice of that proposition at all. I have always understood that the tithe was a charge primarily on the land. It does not seem to me that because a man collects that charge by deputy the latter is to have against somebody else precisely the same rights as the tithe owner him against him. The proposition of my
 1453
*(5.21.)  MR. SIDNEY GEDGE : I think it would be far better to have the Lords' Amendment as it is. At present, if the occupier does not pay the tithe rent-charge, the owner may distrain upon the land out of which the tithe issues, and also on any other land within the parish of which the occupier is the owner, or which he holds under the same landlord. This Bill proposes that the occupier shall no longer pay the tithe rent-charge, but that the landlord shall pay it, and it gives the landlord identically the same powers as the tithe owner possessed, so that the occupier is in no worse position, while the landlord is in a worse, and not a better, position, because he has no general powers of recovery, but only those which the tithe owner had before.
 *MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : I will point out that unless this Amendment of the Lords' is passed, it might happen that a landlord giving a receipt for this charge without stating the fact would thereby render the receipt bad in law; and there being no legal voucher that the money had been paid, it might have to be paid over again.
*(7.42.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE : It is quite clear that as this Amendment now stands we cannot put it into a satisfactory shape. I think the best course would be to disagree with the clause,
 1472
*(7.29.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE : I beg to join in the request to the Government that this matter be postponed. I think if we had time to consider the matter, by to-morrow we could make the clause perfectly clear.
*(11.16.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE : I may remind hon. Members that the clause simply does that in one case which the law now does in all cases. The Bill will relieve the occupier in all other cases, but this is an exceptional case in which, owing to the arrangements entered into between occupier and tenant, the tithe owner cannot get his

 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : Take pasture land where during the winter months there may be nothing to distrain upon. Then, again, take orchards, where there may be for a considerable time no produce capable of distraint. I know a case in Kent to which this section was applied. An orchard had not produced any kind of fruit worth gathering for several years. Tithe had accrued, there was nothing on the land to distrain, and this section was put in force. It was manured, dug, pruned, and cultivated by the clergyman of the parish, and he afterwards took a crop of fruit, and
 1459 supersedeas
*(6.18.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : This section is not to apply merely to land that yields no-produce, it applies to cases of land where at the time of distress there is not sufficient on the land to answer the distress, and the two cases are entirely different. During a large part of the year the bulk of the land of a farm may have nothing on it capable of being distrained upon.
(7.3.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON : I would certainly join in the request that the Government should postpone this clause, because I feel serious doubts as to whether the County Court Judge has the power to make such an order as is suggested. Is it proposed that the County Court should have power to make an order in the nature of a writ of possession, power to take accounts and have control of the property, power to put the tithe owner in possession, and to exercise a certain control while he is in possession, and further power to make another order in the nature of a writ of  supersedeas
*(6.52.) MR. T. H. BOLTON : When there is no distress the receivership is practically determined, and the matter is handed over to the Superior Court. My hon. Friend (Mr. Lloyd-George) was mistaken in supposing that the process of writ of inquiry by the Sheriff will be at all necessary. I apprehend it will not be necessary. On the production of an order of the County Court Judges an officer of the Superior Court should issue the writ of  habere facias possessionem 1464

 COLONEL WARING  (Down, N.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether Mr. Myles Blake Burke has been compulsorily retired from the office of County Inspector, Royal Irish Constabulary, with a pension of £400 per annum, in consequence of alleged incapacity for further service; whether the injuries which caused such incapacity, if it existed, were received when on duty, and whether, if this be so, he would be entitled to £500 instead of £400 a year; and whether his Petition to Her Majesty to have his case re-considered has reached the Treasury through the Irish Government, to whom it was referred by Her Majesty's Command; and what course he intends to take with regard to it?
(12.53.)  COLONEL WARING  (Down, N.) : I may say that the hon. Member who last spoke has not quoted the will of the founder, nor did the proposer of the Motion.
 COLONEL WARING : At any rate, we on this side have in our favour the decision of the Court of Chancery in 1858, which distinctly provided that the two denominations shall be equally represented. The school will be closed to Protestant

 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am not at present in the possession of information that would enable me to answer it. I do not look upon it as an urgent matter.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I distinctly decline to state.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am not yet in a position to say.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope it will be possible to go into Committee on the Civil Service Estimates on Monday. Tomorrow the Government hope to proceed with several of the Bills on the Paper.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The matter will be referred to the Judicial Committee with full assurance that they have authority to deal with it.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Her Majesty's Government do not think it advisable to propound this question to the Judicial Committee.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I have seen the Report of the Royal Commission on the Laws of Marriage, presented in 1868, and although it is doubtless desirable that the Laws of Marriage should be assimilated, yet, looking to the time that has elapsed since the Commission reported, it is evident that the subject is one of considerable difficulty. I am, therefore, unable to hold out any hopes that the Government, with a very limited time at their disposal, will be able to deal with the matter in the course of the present Session. With regard to the Bills now before the House for altering the laws affecting Nonconformist marriages, it will be for the House itself to decide, when the Bills reach the Committee stage, whether it is desirable that they should be referred to a Select Committee.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I believe that some legislative action has been taken by foreign Governments; but the very short notice given me by the hon. Member has not been sufficient for me to ascertain all the facts of the case.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : If the Motion is not taken before Easter, it shall not be taken till the Thursday after the Easter Holidays.
*(10.54.)  SIR. M. HICKS BEACH : The right hon. Gentleman has entirely misrepresented, first, the argument of the Attorney General, and, secondly, the possible operation of this clause. The Attorney General did not use the argument which the right hon. Gentleman attributes to him—that this clause is not intended to apply to cases of collusion. It is intended so to apply; but the argument of the Attorney General was that there may be cases as between landlord and tenant which the Courts would not interpret to be cases of collusion, and yet which would be cases to which this clause ought to apply. The right hon. Gentleman also said that this clause would come into operation in the case of an ordinary agreement between landlord and tenant. That is a complete delusion. In such cases the rule is that a rack-rent is paid for the land; and in no such case would this clause come into operation. The only case in which the clause would come into operation would be one in which the landlord and the tenant had deliberately contracted together that the farm should be held at less than a rack-rent, either by the payment of a fine, or by the granting to the landlord of some corresponding advantage, with the result that the yearly rent by which the tenant held the farm would become insufficient to satisfy the sum ordered to be recovered for the tithe rent-charge. Anybody who knew the relations between landlord and tenant in England knew that such cases would be extremely rare.
(6.58.)  MR. BEADEL  (Essex, Chelmsford) : I beg to suggest that, instead of the words proposed by the right hon. Gentleman being added after the word "waste," they should be inserted after the word "obligation" in the preceding line, the effect being that the person obtaining possession shall be under an obligation either to cultivate the land in a good and husband like way according to the custom of the country, or, if he should let the land, to bind the tenant so to cultivate it.
 MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, for the convenience of Scotch Members, he will postpone the Motion for a Committee on the Private Bill Procedure (Scotland) Bill until the latter part of the week after the Easter holiday?
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : I am afraid that I can add little to the answer which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave in reply to a question addressed to him on the 23rd ult. by the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Essex. The Trade Union Acts are based on the principle of a minimum of official interference. Clause 4 of the Act of 1871, 31 and 35 Vict., cap. 31, enacts that—
 "Nothing in this Act will enable any Court to entertain any legal proceeding instituted with the object of directly enforcing or recovering damages for the breach of any of the following agreements, namely, … 3. Any agreement for the application of the funds of a Trade Union ( a
 MR. JACKSON : The negotiations referred to have reached such a stage that I think I may say that a decision will be come to at such a date as not to preclude the Eyemouth Harbour Commissioners, in the event of its being favourable, from taking advantage of the coming season.
 MR. JACKSON : Mr. Burke was retired from the Constabulary on Jane 1st, 1887, on the ground that he had received injuries rendering him unfit for farther service. His age was 61. The pension to which his service of 39 years entitled him was £386 15s.; but as he would have completed another year in the following September the Treasury awarded him £400 per annum, the amount for which a service of 40 years would have qualified him. The Treasury did not consider that the injuries which caused Mr. Burke's retirement were

 MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether, in view of the unsatisfactory and doubtful state of the law respecting the metalliferous mines of Great Britain and Ireland which contain base and precious metals in varied proportions and of varied values, and of the want of uniformity of the law in Her Majesty's possessions, the Government would support legislation which would make the law uniform, or, failing that, would alter the law so as to encourage (while maintaining the prerogative of the Crown) the development of the mineral resources of Great Britain and Ireland with profit to the owners of such mines and to the State?
 MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN  (Merthyr Tydvil) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he has received any communications through the Lord Lieutenant of Merionethshire relating to a desire to form a battalion of Volunteers in that county; whether he has refused permission to establish such a battalion; whether he is aware that Colonel Liddel, the officer commanding the Militia in the district, has alluded to the difficulty he experiences in obtaining recruits, and has expressed the opinion that such difficulty would probably be overcome if a battalion of Volunteers were established; and whether, in view of the fact that there are no Volunteers-in the county, he will re-consider his decision?
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : Will the right hon. Gentleman answer the first part of the question?
 MR. SUMMERS : Under what statute will the question be referred to the Privy Council?
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he can inform the House what is the total number of on-licences in England and Wales; and what is the total number of premises in respect of which on-licences have been granted that are owned by brewers and by brewery companies?
 MR. TOMLINSON  (Preston) : I rise to order, Sir. Is it order for the hon. Member to quote from Debates in the other House during the present Session?
 MR. TOMLINSON : I only wish to say that the hon. Member seems to forget the nature of tithe, and that by the Bill the tithe rent-charge is not a debt due from the landlord, and if it were so there would be no necessity for this clause at all.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Upon that point, Sir, may I ask you whether on consideration of Lords' Amendments, it is permissible, or not, to discuss the grounds upon which an Amendment was adopted in another place?
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Did not the Attorney General state he never alluded to collusion? If he did not, then this Amendment is aimed at legitimate transactions. That is a perfectly fair statement of what the Attorney General said. Let us take that as the basis. Are you going in this Amendment, which is not part of your original policy, which has never been defended by the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill except on the ground of collusion and illegitimate relations, to launch against the tenant farmers of England a provision which makes them responsible for the payment of the tithe in perfectly legitimate transactions in relation to land? Why do you force on this clause in this way? If the hon. Member for the Oxford University is content to have this clause limited to cases of collusion, why do you accept it from the House of Lords as applicable to cases which are not cases of collusion? It is unfair in legitimate transactions between landlord and tenant to impose such liabilities on the occupier, and leave him to recover from the
 1498
 SIR W. HARCOURT : That this was not aimed at illegitimate collusion.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : The real reason why the Amendment is proposed is that there is a general feeling against retrospective legislation. Before the passing of the Act the occupying tenant at a rack-rent and the occupying tenant on a beneficial lease were not in the same situation. Now, for the first time, you are proposing to make the occupying tenant under a beneficial lease responsible in the way the occupying tenant at a rack-rent is made responsible. What I contend is that if the Government choose to make legislation of this kind, which I protest against, at all events, they should not make it retrospective in regard to antecedent contracts. What we are trying to do is to mitigate the clause. With one exception the Government have refused all mitigations we have proposed, and that is why we have been obliged to continue so far in opposition to this clause. It is quite plain that if you are to embark on new legislation of this kind you ought to give the tithe-rent owner his remedy direct against the landowner, instead of getting at the owner through the occupier. I will tell you why you did not. It was because the clause comes to you from a House in the interest of the landowners. If all you desire is to secure the tithe to the tithe owner, do you not in the clause go direct against the man who admittedly ought to pay? It is because the House of Lords will not allow you to do it. [" Oh, oh!"  from the Ministerial Benches
(7.10.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I can confirm the statement of my hon. Friend behind me, that he has given valuable support to the Government on this Bill, and I would venture to point out that we are now in exactly the position we were in when this very clause was in Committee. When it came to be discussed in Committee it was found that it was surrounded by so many difficulties,
 1466 fieri facias possessionem 1467 habere facias possessionem 1468
 SIR W. HARCOURT : At what time of the year?
(7.32.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : It is evident that this clause has been brought forward without due consideration. There are only two courses open to us; either to postpone the Bill or to drop this clause altogether.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : The question is whether any writ can be issued without an inquisition upon the order of the County Court. There are no such words in Section 82, which imply that a writ can be issued without an inquisition. It is a condition precedent.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Yes; I beg pardon; the Act of 1836. Practically speaking, it is only after the issue of the writ that the machinery of the Act of 1836 is applied. I think no such difficulties as are anticipated will arise, and there is no necessity for postponement, because we do not propose to abolish the existing law.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I did not intend to do so. It was originally intended that jurisdiction in these matters should be transferred to the County Court, but it is now quite clear that that has not been done, and that it remains with the High Court. I think we ought to prolong this Debate, unless the Government choose to drop the clause out of the Bill.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : The noble Lord, who seems to consider himself in charge of the Bill, will, I suppose, tell the Government what they are to do. After the argument of the hon. Member for Stockton—than whom, despite his modesty, we could have no higher authority—we know that this question is not even arguable. Under the Act of 1836' the High Court could alone issue the writ, and although as the Attorney General admitted, the Government intended that the writ should be issued by the County Court, we know now it cannot be done.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Then the Government did not communicate their intentions to the hon. and learned Gentleman. No doubt they intended it should be so.
(7.43.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I agree with the hon. Member for Stockport that it is desirable we should agree with the Lords' Amendment.
(9.20.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : We are all familiar with the fact that the hon. Member who has just sat down is the champion of the tithe owner. We have heard the claims of the tithe owner put pretty high, and the privileges of the parson elevated sufficiently in former discussions, but when the hon. Member puts tithe owners on a par with Her Majesty's Exchequer, to which are given remedies unknown in any other case, I think he is a little too strong. It if admitted that the man who is to pay is not the right man; but because it is difficult to get at the right man, it is intended to make the wrong man pay, and let him get his remedy from the right man if he can. Everyone admits that the owner should pay, and having made that a principle of your Bill you then go at the occupier and say he shall pay this and recover it from the owner if and how he can. As
 1483 1484 Punch
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Impecunious when he comes back from Monte Carlo.
(10.22.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I understand that the Government are willing to accept this Amendment. So far, so good, as regards giving some remedy to the occupier. But I should like to point out that, in order to avoid one evil, they are falling into another, because the basis of this measure has been that there is to be no personal liability imposed upon anyone. Yet it is perfectly obvious that the result of this will be to overthrow the whole basis of the measure, because, although it is founded upon the principle of no personal liability, yon are adding to it now a proposal to make a personal liability on the part of the owner at the suit of the occupier. This shows that the matter has never been properly considered. You have got an acknowledged evil that may arise in the case of collusion. A natural thing would have been to draw up a clause pointed at collusion, and have limited it to that. The whole argument of the Attorney General was founded on the necessity of dealing with collusive facts. The Government have now got into a scrape, and the difficulty is how they can get out of it. Can it be done by simply giving the occupier a right of action at law against the owner? Bear in mind the argument which we have been urging, which is, that the owner may be impecunious. And then I would like to know what sort of remedy would it be to the occupier to give him a right of an action at law against the impecunious owner? It does not benefit him in the least. We want an answer on this point from the President of the Board of Trade. The Attorney General is no doubt most competent to deal with matters of law, but it is a remarkable fact that upon this clause, although appeal after appeal has been made by county Members on Benches opposite to the Government to give a satisfactory answer on this point,

 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : What business will be taken on the next day and on Monday? Further, what date will be fixed for the Committee on the Civil Service Estimates?
(4.55.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I do not see why the Government should object to that. It is much simpler than the present form.
(5.44.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I quite agree with the Attorney General as to the general change made in the original provision. I confess that when I first saw the Amendments of the Lords, I was utterly unable to understand why they altered the Bill. I thought they had some object in making the alterations, and that they regarded this as something different from the arrangement to which the Attorney General has referred. It is ridiculous to say this is better drafting—it is worse drafting. The Attorney General has not attempted to explain why the alteration is made; but he has appealed to us on this side of the House, and to me specially, to adhere to Clause 85. I do not know whether Clause 85 was discussed; it was certainly not discussed when I was here, because I have learned a great deal more about
 1455
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I thought when the Attorney General said it was discussed in Committee it must have been when I was absent. But the hon. Member for Mid Glamorgan was never away. Now that the Lords have brought the clause specially under our notice, I think we are entitled to see what the operation of the clause will be. The hon. Member for Dorsetshire has pointed out what an exceedingly invidious position a landlord will be in if he is empowered to exercise such, power as this. I think there are few people who would be disposed to say that a landlord should distrain not only upon in the case of the farm which the tenant holds under him, but also in the case of some other farm. Few people would have the courage to make such an assertion unless it be the noble Lord the Member for Darwen, who, in the interest of truth, justice, religion, and piety, would do his duty and distrain upon the yeoman. Such an operation would not commend this Bill or the persons who took advantage of it to the agricultural tenants of the country. In the interest of the Bill the Government would do well not to press the powers under Clause 85. In respect to the argument of the Attorney General, I should like to say I have never heard of a landlord sueing the tenant for the non-payment of tithe. I have always understood that the landlord has been willing to leave the tithe owner to enforce the obligation in regard to tithe. I am fully persuaded that if this clause is ever acted upon a great deal of irritation, vexation, and discontent will be created; and in opposing the clause I do not consider I am departing from any understanding which has been come to.

For what reason do they object to the receipts setting forth distinctly what the money is paid for? I should think there must be something absolutely dishonest in the mind of a man who refuses to say what he gives a receipt for.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE ADMIRALTY (Mr. FORWOOD,  Lancashire, Ormskirk : In the unavoidable absence of my noble Friend the First Lord I will answer the question. The minimum age for the admission of hired men to Chatham, Portsmouth, and Devonport Dockyards is 21; there is no maximum age. A discharged soldier was refused admission at Chatham in February last as being "too old for consideration," but a further inquiry is being made in his case. Under existing regulations labourers are selected from the whole body of candidates who present themselves, and are not entered unless accustomed to labour and constitutionally capable of performing the duties required of them, and I do not consider it desirable to make any alteration in this practice.

 MR. KING  (Hull, Central) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India (1) whether it is customary to allow officers of the Indian Army 90 days' privilege leave, of which they avail themselves to make brief visits to the United Kingdom; (2) whether it is usual to count the 90 days from the day when the officer leaves the station where he is serving, wherever it may be situated in any part of India or Burma, the difference in some cases between Bombay—the necessary point of departure from India for so short an absence—and many of the stations, varying from two or three days to three weeks or over in going and returning; (3) whether, having regard to the fact that officers in the Bombay Army, stationed in or near the City of Bombay, have a great advantage over officers in up-country stations, or in Madras, Bengal, and Burma, the Secretary of State will consider the advisability of recommending to the Indian Government that in the case of privilege leave for 90 days, the leave shall count from the date of embarkation for England at the port of Bombay, regulations being framed as to the additional time to be allowed from the various stations or districts to the port of embarkation; and (4) whether, as the season for leave is rapidly approaching, an early intimation can be given to that effect?
 SIR H. ROSCOE  (Manchester, S.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it is the case that an unknown donor has offered £80,000 to build an Art Gallery on a site at South Kensington, the erection of which would materially interfere with the purposes for which land was recently bought by Government for housing the Science Collections, and for the necessary erection of suitable chemical and physical laboratories in connection with the Royal School of Science; whether another site at South Kensington has been offered which would not interfere with the object for which Parliament granted the purchase-money for the land; and whether the Government will give an assurance that these objects will be maintained?

 SIR J. FERGUSSON : I was myself surprised to see the publication to which the right hon. Gentleman refers. The Report is not absolutely correct in regard to several paragraphs, which were only added at the last minute. I have no knowledge how it was furnished, and it is a breach of order on the part of any one to furnish the Report in such circumstances to a newspaper. I do not think that any Member of the Committee would do that. Perhaps it is hardly a matter to which serious attention need be called, but I am glad the right hon.

 1489
*(11.19.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE : I hope the Government will re-consider this point. Of course there would be reason for the Amendment if it were confined to cases of collusion between landlord and tenant, though I think there is very little possibility of such a conspiracy arising. Indeed, it is casting a most undeserved slur upon the agricultural classes to introduce a penal clause like this. I can speak as a landowner and a tithe owner, and I am bound to say that I have heard from no member of either class any approval of this clause, and I am at a loss to understand why the other House inserted the clause, and why Her Majesty's Government accepted it.
*(7.40.)  SIR J. PEASE  (Durham, Barnard Castle) : It seems, from the proposition made in such a fair spirit by the President of the Board of Trade, that this clause must be amended, and I therefore think it would be much better for the Government to take up some other business for the remainder of the evening, and endeavour, before again bringing this matter on, to amend the clause in a practical way. At present, so far as we have been able to gather from the Debate, the lawyers on both sides of the House are unable to understand it, and, therefore, I am sure that laymen cannot be expected to do so. When the clause is brought forward in a form in which it is possible to understand it, I think we shall be able to discuss the matter. I beg to move that the Debate be now adjourned.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : I have taken the full blame on myself. It is not a question of the Government communicating their intentions to me. I was responsible for the original suggestion. I have frankly said that I made a mistake in answering a question across the floor of this House,
 1471
 SIR R. WEBSTER : I made a mistake to-night in saying that the Government intended that the writ should be issued by the County Court.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : That is a matter of opinion. The Statute says that the County Court may issue the writ, and, with due deference to the judgment of the right hon. Gentleman, I have no doubt the proceedings may be taken up under Section 82, at the stage of the issue of the writ. At any rate, that is the procedure we contemplate. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman what is the necessity for this procedure. It has become necessary to deal with derelict farms, on which no distress could be levied. We have already provided for the protection of the occupier, if he desires to prevent the writ being issued. The writ being issued, it is desirable that further proceedings should be under the Act of 1836; not Section 82, as the right hon. Gentleman observed.
(6.47.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I have no objection to dealing with the substance of the Amendment, but I think the particular line the right hon. Gentleman has taken does not meet the case. It is not necessary to put in the owner, as we are only dealing with the question of there being sufficient distress on the premises. I would suggest that the words should run—
 "After such service on the occupier, if necessary, as may be prescribed, and after hearing such occupier if he desires to he heard." 1463
(7.22.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I can only speak with the indulgence of the House, and I should like to say at once that I made a mistake when I said that the County Court issued the process. There is no necessity for postponement, as the preliminary steps to which reference has been made would no longer be necessary.
(6.55.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : There is not the slightest intention of relieving a-person who has taken possession of the land from obligations such as are contained in the existing law. The idea in referring to Section 82 of the Act of 1836, was to get a starting point. The County Court would be able to do that which was pointed out by the hon. Member opposite (Mr. Bolton). It would be a matter of form.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : That is simply a re-statement of my proposition. Surely the hon. Member does not mean to suggest he would countenance a bargain whereby a poor unfortunate clergyman would be deprived of £10 which might be due to him as tithe. The clause contemplates cases in which it is the  bonâ fide
 SIR R. WEBSTER : I never said anything of the kind.
(10.40.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : It has been suggested I spoke of fraud and fraudulent conspiracy. I certainly never referred to fraud or fraudulent conspiracy, and I am not aware I used the word collusion. I referred to several cases which were not collusive. I spoke of perfectly  bonâ fide bonâ fide bonâ fide
(8.5.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : The hon. Gentleman and his friends recognise there is a difficulty to be dealt with. They proposed some time ago to find a remedy in the sale of the land, but they have abandoned that proposal. What is the difficulty which has to be met? It is true, as the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade has pointed out, that the discussion initiated on the previous stage of the Bill has opened people's eyes to a way in which the payment of tithe could be evaded. Let us take a simple case: Suppose a landlord and tenant enter into an agreement whereby the tenant says "instead of paying you £50 a year rent for 10 years I will pay you £400 down." The occupier knows perfectly well that tithe is due and would become due from year to year; he knows the land is worth £50 a year, but he elects to pay a proportionately smaller sum down in order that neither party may be required to pay tithe. I submit there is no hardship in such a case in putting the occupier in the position of owner. I appeal to the House to consider what is the best and fairest way of dealing with such an attempt to evade the payment of tithe, You cannot sell the reversioner's interest; that is an impracticable remedy. When you are dealing with land which is fairly worth from year to year more than the tithe, you ought to provide that the tithe should he received  in anno in anno 1476
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : As there must be a further stage of this Bill, I would ask the hon. Member not to press his Amendment, but simply to put it upon the Paper so that it may be considered by the Lord Chancellor, who has carefully gone into the whole question involved in the provisions of this measure. The matter can then be dealt with on the Report stage.
(12.23.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I have no objection to the clause, save that it is one which is without the matters which
 1511
(12.17.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I am most unwilling to fetter the discretion of the Court by adopting the form of words suggested. And our objection is that the Bill provides that a parent who has deserted his child shall not be allowed its custody again until he has satisfied the Court of his fitness. I am strongly of opinion that it would be better to leave the Bill as it stands than to insert defining words.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : It is scarcely fair of the right hon. Gentleman. I was pointing out it was not aimed solely at that.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Only.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : I hope the hon. Member will not press this Motion. There is quite sufficient in the clause as it stands to show that the money is paid in respect of tithe rent-charge, and to stamp the obligation resting on the person receiving the money. As was pointed out in Committee, the object was not to alter the liability, but to direct that the landlord should ear-mark or stamp the amount received for tithe rent-charge. I think it is hardly fail-now to alter the provision in the way proposed by the hon. Member.
(5.38.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I must say that in regard to the course of the previous discussion and the understanding between the two sides of the House, I shall be indeed surprised if the majority of the House should come to the con-delusion that the clause ought to deprive the landlord of his remedy when he has paid the tithe which the tenant ought to pay. Last year we introduced a provision that where the landlord paid the tithe himself it should be treated as rent as between the landlord and tenant. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby (Sir W. Harcourt) said this would be an unfair thing, because at present the tithepayer is only liable to be distrained upon under the Act of 1836. The right hon. Gentleman and others pressed us to give the landlord, who has paid the tithe, the same remedy as though he was the tithe owner, and no other remedy. That principle we accepted. We were pressed by the hon. Member for Stockport, and many other hon. Members behind us, to give the landlords that remedy which would naturally flow through a breach of contract. We resisted that pressure; we declined to in any way depart from the principles which were pressed upon us by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby. That was not all. In Committee Section 85 was discussed, and the Bill left the House with the bargain carried out that the landlord would pay the tithe, and have as against the tenant the same remedy that the tithe owner would have had, and no more. What
 1454
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : Until removed by the Court a bankrupt can act as trustee; but under Section 147 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, the Court has power to remove a trustee, and has done so both in cases in which the bankrupt has obtained his discharge as well as in cases where he is undischarged. It is not quite clear whether the section applies to an  ex officio
 MR. S. T. EVANS : It was never mentioned in the last Debate.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Will the right hon. Gentleman accept the words "if there shall be"?
(6.12.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : The right hon. Gentleman has given me the opportunity of seeing this Amendment, but I cannot say I have had time to properly consider it. The original proposition was that the officer should satisfy the Court; but now the right hon. Gentleman proposes to turn the sentence topsy-turvy, and says "if the Court is satisfied." I do not wish to prejudice the discussion of the Amendment generally, and I say nothing about giving a hearing to the tenant, as to which my hon. Friend will have something to say. I observe that the words do not indicate how the Court is to be satisfied. I do not myself see the advantage of the words. If the clause is to come in let it come in as it originally stood. What is the reason for altering the words in the old Act, that "if there shall be no distress," and so on, the writ may issue? What is the difficulty that the wording is intended to meet?
(5.12.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : The whole of Section 1 was struck out by the Lords in order to insert quite a new remedy, enabling the landlord to distrain for his tithes, or rather the words were re-inserted in an altered form. I want to point out that that alteration is a very serious one. The words were originally "by distress in like manner as provided by the Tithes Act." The Lords referred to two sections of the Act of 1836, namely, Sections 81 and 85. I have no objection to the words as they stand if they are confined to Section 81, but I think the words in Section 85 ought to be
 1449
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I have an Amendment which, as the time has been very limited, I have been unable to place upon the Paper. I propose, in order to
 1448
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Mr. Speaker——
(4.57.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I do not see any reason for the omission of these words. They were accepted upon my Motion, and I hope the Government will stick to them. One of the chief reasons why the Lords struck out the words was that they objected to the tithe being earmarked. Now I contend that the tithe should be earmarked in order to enable the tenant to see that he is not called upon by the new statutory contract to pay a sum which he was not under a liability to pay before. The object of these words is very evident. Let me put a case before the House. Suppose a tithe rent-charge of £5 is by the fall in the value of corn reduced to £4 10s., how is the tenant to know he is not called upon to pay more than he was liable for under the old contract? A very high authority in the other House, no less an authority than the Prime Minister himself, said it was of the utmost necessity to keep the tenant in the dark as to what he will be called upon to pay. But although we are always willing to listen to the recommendations of the Prime Minister, I think the House will agree with me that people who are placed under certain obligations by Act of Parliament should know the exact extent of these obligations. Yet the object in omitting these words is to keep the tenant in the dark.
(4.40.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I am afraid the effect will be more wide-reaching. It will make the tenant liable to an indefinite extent for tithe after his contract has expired, and that will be a very dangerous proceeding indeed.
(4.35.)  MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : It would, of course, be irregular at this stage to enter into details of the Amendments. We on this side rejoice at the decision of the Government with reference to the last Amendment referred to by the right hon. Gentleman. But with reference to the Amendment incorporated in Clause B, I think that requires further consideration. I hold that the way in which it has been dealt with in another place is most objectionable. As these Amendments were only circulated yesterday we have had scarcely any time in which to consider them, or in which to draw up any counter proposals that may be necessary. I hope the Government will give us further time to consider the matter.
(4.39.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I think this Amendment is more important than might be supposed from the mere words.
 1445
 MR. S. T. EVANS : It seems to me that these points of order hon. Members are so anxious to raise show the anxiety to keep out of view the very object with the Amendment was introduced. I hope I may now proceed to read the words used by the Prime Minister in reply to
 1501 "After the matter has been enormously discussed in private, though no doubt it is surrounded with difficulties on every side, no remedy has been proposed that is entirely satisfactory. Although it is somewhat clumsy, and will operate rather by deterring the owner than by any effect of its own operation, still it will practically prevent that which we have reason to apprehend, namely, a collusive arrangement of the terms of occupancy for the purpose of evading payment of the tithe rent-charge. When my noble and learned Friend first Drought this question before the House, I thought it was rather like the question of the Confessor who asked the groom 'whether he ever greased the horses' teeth in order to pre vent them from eating oats '—' No, but I will take care to do it next time,' was the answer of the groom. I thought that the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord was due rather to his own enormous ingenuity "— "and would rather have a tendency to raise in the minds of evil-thinking men some idea of evading the rent-charge by a method which they never would have thought of themselves. When the noble and learned Lord had once raised it he was certainly bound to find a remedy, and I think the remedy proposed would be satisfactory." bonâ fide bonâ fide 1502
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Following upon your ruling, Sir, I venture to think that the House would prefer that I should not use words of my own in giving my impression of what took place, but that I should cite the very words used by the Prime Minister. This is the  Hansard "After the matter has been enormously discussed in private, though no doubt it is surrounded with difficulties on every side "——
(11.1.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I think this Amendment is well calculated to test the  bona fides 1500
(11.45.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : We need not apologise for getting up over and over again and trying to mitigate this clause, which is admitted to be a most
 1507
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Suppose, as very often happens, the occupier says, "I must have farm buildings" and the landlord says, "I am a poor man, I cannot afford to erect buildings, but if you will erect them I will let you off the rent for seven years."
(7.55.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I think this is the proper place to move the Amendment to leave out from "order," to the end of the clause, in order to insert the following words:—
 "Sum ordered to be recovered or the portion thereof remaining unpaid shall, until payment thereof, he a charge upon the interest in the lands of the owner of such lands, but such charge shall not be enforceable by sale until a year has elapsed after the creation thereof." 1474 1475
(10.18.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I beg to move to add, at the end of Clause B, the words—
 "Provided further that such occupier shall he entitled to recover from such landlord by action at law any such amount which shall have been recovered from him under this section as aforesaid as money paid on the account of such landlord." 1492
(7.0.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : This illustrates the difficulty we have in discussing Amendments of so technical and compli-
 1465
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I beg to second that.
 SIR W. LAWSON : Sir C. Forster voted in the majority.
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : I wish, Sir, to ask you a question, as there is a slight error in the report of our proceedings yesterday. In the record of the Division that took place, the Noes are given as 179. If you add up the names of the Members as printed, they come to only 178. Is there any way of putting that right?
 *THE VICE PRESIDENT OF the COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : It is impossible to include such instruction in the obligatory subjects prescribed by the Code; but by the removal of all restrictions as to optional
 1421
(5.2.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE  (Lancashire, N.E., Darwen) : I hope the House will not disagree with this Amendment, as I think the Lords did quite right in omitting the words they have struck out. I do not believe that the effect of it will be that any occupier in Wales will be left in the dark, as has been suggested, and certainly no hardship can attach to the occupier if these words are omitted. I would, therefore, suggest that the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade should adhere to the Amendment made by their Lordships.
*(5.29.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE : I would willingly regard the tithe rent-charge as part of the rent which the tenant pays to the landlord, but the House has decided that it will make a distinction. I hold that the landlord should have exactly the same power to recover from the occupier which the tithe owner has at present. It is quite evident that the landlord ought to have the same power of recovery from the occupier as the tithe owner has now. it has been said that some of us on this side of the House never speak except in the interests of the Church. This proposal has nothing whatever to do with the interests of the Church, but it would, I think, be very unfair to the landowner.
 VISCOUNT CRANBORNE : Oh, oh!
 VISCOUNT GRIMSTON : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the abolition of the power on the part of the companies to carry parcels and letters will render the remainder of the business unremunerative and will entail a loss on the companies?
 VISCOUNT GRIMSTON  (Herts, St. Alban's) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he is prepared to fix electric calls in the houses of such persons as may desire the same, without charge, as the District Messengers Company have done and are now doing, and to supply messengers to run errands and make small purchases; carry notes and parcels; call cabs, policemen in case of burglary, fire-engines in case of fire, &c.; and, if not, if he will consider favourably the Petition of the said company to carry on their business under a royalty to the Post Office, before depriving the public of this great and much-appreciated convenience?
 EARL COMPTON  (York, W.R., Barnsley) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether there are any candidates, who have passed the Second Division examination, waiting for appointments to the Post Office Savings Banks; and, if so, whether he can state whether temporary clerks who have not passed any Civil Service examination are being employed in the Post Office Savings Banks during ordinary official hours, while duly qualified clerks are waiting for appointment?
 MR. STAVELEY HILL  (Staffordshire, Kingswinford) : Before the question is answered I desire to put one to the First Lord of the Treasury upon the same subject. I have received the following cable message from the Speaker of the House of Assembly and the President of the Legislative Council:—
 MR. H. T. KNATCHBULL HUGESSEN : Well, the hon. Gentleman said he hoped so, and he also said the Church Party would not gain anything by this measure. I wish to call attention to the primary operation of the first portion of the Bill, which shifts the onus of the tithe from the occupier to the landowner. That is undoubtedly a gift on the part of the landlords' Party, and justifies me in declining to agree with my hon. Friend in saying that it does not contain a fair measure of compromise. It seems to me that the Opposition are not quite fair in the way in which they regard the property of the tithe owners. They seem to look upon the property in tithe as they would not look on any other kind of property. Why, I should like to ask, is the tithe owner to be placed in a worse position than the owner of any other description of property? These are some of the reasons why it appears to me to be absolutely impossible not to adopt some clause of this kind, whereby the tithe owner is placed in a position enabling him to recover what is his due. At the same time, while saying this, I must also say that I do not regard the clause as, on the whole, a very satisfactory one. I cannot help thinking the Government would suffer no great disadvantage if they adopted the suggestion thrown out by my hon. Friend, and gave the House of Lords the opportunity of further considering this clause, together with the other clause with which we have disagreed. I cannot say that I regard the
 1552
*(3.58.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS  (Carnarvonshire, Eifion) : The right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade has based his argument against the clause mainly on the provision of Clause 5, whereby a remission is made where the amount of tithe exceeds two-thirds of the value of the land. The right hon. Gentleman doubted whether the rack-rent always represented the value of the land. What I wish to point out is, that it may very often happen that although a remission ought to be granted, the tenant would be unable to obtain the benefit of it in consequence of some default on the part of the landlord. Suppose we take the case of an absentee landlord, against whom tithe is claimed in Court. Judgment in that case would go by default for the entire amount of the tithe, and the tenant on whom it is now sought to impose responsibility would have no opportunity of obtaining the remission allowed under Clause 5. The landlord having neglected to appear, there is no provision that service should be made upon the tenant. In a case of a contract of tenancy made before the passing of the Act, service is compulsory upon the tenant, the tenant may appear, and he may be able to get a remission; but it will be different with contracts entered into after the passing of this Act. I will put a concrete case. Assume a farm on which the tithe amounts to £60 a year; assume that that farm cannot be let at a rack-rent of more than £40; suppose that the landlord is abroad, that proceedings have been taken against him, and he does not appear. What occurs? The tenant is not aware that a possession order has been made, and that the sum of £60 is to be recovered under Section
 1553
(9.30.)  DR. McDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : The Mover and Seconder of the Resolution said this was a very small matter indeed, and I quite agree with them. I understand the Government are going to accept the Resolution, and I suppose we must be thankful for very small mercies. I, myself, think that in many instances this proposal will be resented by the crofters, who will say they are able to manage their own affairs. In the village in which I was brought up, it was the custom for the
 1589
(9.33.)  DR. McDONALD : I know this proposal is regarded as necessary in some places, but I am afraid it will not be received with a very good grace by a great many communities in the Highlands. In a great many districts the people have been very dependent on the estate managers, who have done everything for them, and now they are not able to take such good care of themselves as other communities which have not been so dependent on the estate managers in the past. If the Government think proper to pass an Act specially for this small matter I have no objection, only if they do so, I think they will find it wise not to make it obligatory, as the crofters are perfectly capable of appointing men to manage their affairs for them in their own way. I think, also, as some authorities have said, that the Act already gives this power, if it is required.
 An hon. MEMBER : Only two institutions.
(9.49.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : These may be the grievances of which the hon. Member for Leith complains, but these must arise in connection with the new crofters who have come in without
 1593 1594
(6.45.)  DR. CLARK : I think this is a bad system we are falling into of inserting in new Bills clauses modifying provisions of existing Acts without giving the House any indication of what is being done. I think it is only fair to the Committee that when such changes are proposed the official in charge of the Bill should say what is being done. Had it not been for the rumours which were circulated, we might not have known that this clause was intended for the relief of the Postmaster General.
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : Would this not weaken the clause, and should you not have the word "or" instead of "and?" I thought the object of the clause was to throw over the merely ornamental Trustees, who never attend the meetings.
(6.36.)  DR. CLARK : I think we ought to hear from the right hon. Gentleman what it is intended to do by means of this clause. It practically abolishes all statutory requirements as to presenting accounts, and if it is passed the Postmaster General will not be compelled to send in his Report as hereto-fore. I have heard that the clause is intended to relieve the right hon. Gentleman at the head of the Post Office of the difficulty he has been placed in by the recant strike.
 MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, after the refusal of the Lords of the Treasury and the Lord President of the Council, he received the deputation from the Lord's Day Society in his official capacity?
 *MR. LAWSON : Hampton Court is open on Sundays.
*(10.1.)  MR. LAWSON  (St. Pancras, W.) : In the Motion which I have placed on the Paper the House will renew its acquaintance with an old friend. I have, however, varied the terms adopted in former Resolutions of the kind. I ask the House to say it is expedient to open those national museums and galleries that are now shut in London on Sunday for certain hours and under special regulations. By "certain hours" I mean on Sunday afternoon from 1 to 6, and by "special regulations" I mean that no man shall be obliged to work more than six days a week. Sir J. Walmesley and Mr. Peter Taylor often introduced Motions on this subject over a long period of years. They laid the foundations of the work of religious emancipation, I am going to ask this House to complete to-night. In 1863 this He use refused, to pass though Lord Palmerston, who was then Prime Minister, supported, a Motion to open on Sundays the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh. Only two years ago the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works (Mr. Plunket) opened those gardens on Sunday amid general applause, and in answer to a question I put to him he said that conspicuous success had attended his action. The murmur of intolerance that proceeded from a small section has died away, and
 1597 "If the people who wanted to go to the museums and picture galleries liked to take a railway ticket to Hampton Court they found they were at liberty to look at the pictures there, but they could not look at the pictures close by their own doors—it might be at Bethnal Green." 1598 "From February, 1890, to December, 1890, there was an almost unbroken decline from an average per evening of 635 to an average of 90. The average for January and February this year has been 120 and 160 respectively." 1599 "Paris, Berlin, Vienna. Florence, and many other cities of the Continent, capitals of varying nationalities, and representing both the Roman Catholic and Protestant religions, have had museums open and the provision of State-supplied and other recreations for many years, with the result of almost unbroken toil for immense numbers of working men, and with a state of morality so much darker than that of London, that infanticide, illegitimacy, suicide, and murder attain a far higher proportion in relation to population in ell those cities than in this Metropolis." 1600 "There can be no doubt that the Sunday opening is greatly appreciated, and it is a very striking fact that the number of visitors in three hours on Sunday is more than double the average on a week day, when the Museum and Art Gallery are open nine and a half hours per day." "At Birmingham the Sunday opening of the Art Gallery has become quite a recognised institution—even the severest Sabbatarians in our midst no longer think it worth while offering the mildest protest against the plan. They philosophically bow to the logically inevitable—thousands visit the Gallery on Sunday afternoons; they are orderly in their manners, and appreciative in their remarks; no damage has ever been done, and little trouble is given to the staff." 1601 "The Galleries at Worcester, Chester, Maidstone, Wolverhampton, and Stoke-on-Trent, opened on Sunday in recent years, have all been closed, an evidence of inutility or of evils attending them on that day." "In answer to your letter of the 13th inst., the opening of the above on Sunday afternoons has proved a success. It was first tried as an experiment in June, 1888. The total attendance for the 21 occasions during which the building was opened was 8,512, or an average of 405 per Sunday afternoon from 2 to 5. Last year the Gallery was open 51 Sundays (from 2 to 5) with an attendance of 16,372, showing an average of 321. The daily average attendance being 346 (open from 10 to 4; 5, 6, 7, and 8, according to the season). The Gallery is now open every Sunday afternoon. Winter months, 2 to 4, October to March; Summer months, 2 to 5." "Considered that Sunday bathing interfered with the sanctity of the Sabbath and was exceedingly improper and unwise." 1602 "There is no more beautiful, no more  religious "We have opened a picture gallery every Easter on Sundays; we have now a Free Library which is always open on that day. My experience is that those who come on Sundays come with a more serious intention; they wear their best clothes and they have more leisure. As a consequence, they look at pictures to learn, and they take up books to study. There has never been any difficulty about order, and the number of people who use the place, is much greater than on other days." "Our attendance on Sundays has always been very much greater than on any other day, often as large as the other days of the week put together." 1603 "I am glad to say that the majority of the Trustees are in favour of opening it on Sunday afternoons, and three-fourths, at least, of the Staff are also in favour of such opening. Many of them are so enthusiastic as to say that they are willing to come and take their turn at attending, even without remuneration. I do not think we should act on that principle, but even if we did, the work would be extremely light. But these men would not be expected to sweep and clean, to stuff birds, to arrange tablets, or write labels, or do any of the real work we expect of them on week days; they would only have to walk the Museum; walk or stand about there a few hours, and then walk back again. Probably if they were not doing this, they would be taking a walk somewhere else, so that they would not be working any harder than usual. And out of our whole Staff only a few need come, so that the turn would only fall upon each man perhaps once in every six or eight Sundays, and we should never ask anyone to come if he had any conscientious objections to do so. We have calculated that the cost of opening every Sunday in the year would probably amount to something under £300 a year, a trifle compared with the cost of the whole Museum, and even as compared with what the evening opening would come to. I therefore, think that Sunday opening would be, on the whole, a greater advantage even than the evening opening, because instead of being tired with their day's work, people would be in a fitter frame of mind and body to look at the beautiful instructing and elevating objects to be seen in a place like the Natural History Museum." 1604 "The desire for rest from ordinary work on Sunday is increasing in France, but there is not a single Frenchman, so far as I know, who desires to close the museums and galleries on Sunday." 1605 "I fear that want of due consideration of this mechanical aspect leads some persons to believe—and many more to pretend, for other purposes, that they believe—that if museums and picture galleries were to be opened on Sunday, the next step would be to open the theatres. If anyone is so foolish as to believe or to argue any such point, you can easily show that there is no analogy whatever between theatres and museums, &c. A theatre is a workshop on a large scale—why, in the Lyceum we employ daily some hundreds of people, varying between 300 and 500 with the play. These people are all workers, and six days work is quite enough for them, as it is for anyone. It is not possible to vary the workers, except, perhaps, here and there, in the merest labouring department. The same work, to be properly done, must be done by the same people, and it could not be practically possible to employ fresh hands. Besides, the actors themselves would be the first to resent any encroachment on their day of rest—in fact, six performances a week are quite enough for all, and where excessive work is attempted, there is very often a lamentable result. For many reasons there is no fear of any system of opening theatres on Sundays creeping in or obtaining a footing here. In Western America, where it is sometimes practised, it is rapidly coming to an end. If I had any power with those in high places, I would say: 'For God's sake, let a little life and a little light into the dead and dark places of our cities, and give our toilers a chance of learning and enjoying something beyond and above the sordid routine of their lives.' " "I am thoroughly in favour of the opening of picture galleries and museums on Sundays, that those whose work allows them no other chance, may see their treasures; but it is altogether a different case, in my humble opinion, with regard to theatres, and I do not
 1606 "But the Lord's Day, in its proper nature, is a day of holy mirth and refreshment, of gladsome worship and honest enjoyment, of family reunion and sober hospitality. The day of rest and refreshment, as well as of worship and religious instruction, has for multitudes become a day of sluggish and wearisome inactivity, and those 'filthy tippling",' which the famous  Book of Sports "In 1647 punishment was ordered, according to the Minutes of the Fife Synod, of 'whoever was guilty of sitting or walking idle upon the streets or fieldes on Sunday.' In 1742, according to an old book, 'sitting idle at their doors was profane.'" Buckle "It was a sin to visit your friends on Sunday; it was sinful either to have your garden watered or your beard shaved. No one, on Sunday, should pay attention to his health or think of his body at all." 1607 1608
 *MR. LAWSON : Practically unanimous—60 to 7.
 *MR. LAWSON : Something like that.
 *MR. LAWSON : I did not refer to the hon. Gentleman at all. From his religion he has thought it better to remain neuter, though in favour of the Motion.
 *MR. LAWSON : There is a museum in the gardens.
(12.30.)  LORD ELCHO  (Ipswich) : I desire to say one word in favour of this Motion. An eloquent passage from the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian has been quoted against this Motion. The right hon. Gentleman was in the House at 11 o'clock, but he is not now to be seen. I trust he did not receive any bad news which took him away. It is important that we should know his opinion. The speech quoted was made in 1869 and, judging from experience, we may presume that the opinion stated by the right hon. Gentleman in 1869 is the exact opposite of that held by him in 1891. The hon. Member for the City (Sir R. Fowler) told us that the Sabbath was a divine institution, and I think he took a rather narrow and somewhat bigoted view of the manner in which we are bound to keep the Sabbath according to the Scriptures. I think the only question we have to consider is that of labour, and certainly, if it were proved that any large amount of labour would be entailed by this Sunday opening of museums, I should vote against it. Bat I think this point has been much exaggerated, and that no more Sunday labour would be required by the opening of museums than is at present required to prepare the Sunday dinners of a few hon. Gentlemen.
(4.14.)  MR. ABEL SMITH  (Herts, E.) : I consider that Clause 5 gives all the protection to the tenant farmer which is necessary. I have for many years served upon an Assessment Committee, and in almost all cases we have fixed the assessment at the rent. Such a case as that quoted by the hon. Member opposite is not likely often to arise. I feel it my duty, therefore, to support this proposal.
*(10.48.)  MR. M'ARTHUR  (Leicester) : I rise to second the Amendment of my hon. Friend opposite, and to oppose the Motion of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, believing, as I do, that the policy recommended for our adoption would be injurious to the public interest, would be especially injurious to the interest of artisans, the working classes, and the poor. Sir, I give the hon. Mover and Seconder of the Resolution full credit for pure motives and good intentions. I doubt not they honestly believe that to open our national museums, picture galleries, and other institutions on Sunday would be an advantage, and that it would not injuriously affect the proper observance of our English Sunday, which I regard as one of the greatest blessings and safeguards of the nation, and the loss of which I would deprecate as one of the greatest calamities that could befal us as a people. Sir, I am
 1610 1611 1612 1613 1614 "The continental Sunday need claim our attention but briefly. It is pointed to by opponents of Sunday opening as an institution of the worst kind, and it is said that if museums are opened here all the vice, work, and other evils of the continental Sunday will follow. But it must be remembered—firstly, that while no Englishman would care to have the continental Sunday here in its entirety, yet it is by no means so black as it has been painted, and its evils are in many points being remedied. Secondly, its evils are not in any way the result of museums and art galleries being open. Sunday work, Sunday theatres, Sunday drinking, dancing, and pleasures existed long before the museums and art galleries were built." 1615 "We Germans and Schleswig-Holsteiners, not the least, are to a great extent far removed from such a celebration of Sunday. The day of rest and of the most elevated joy is too often robbed of its honour. The forenoon of Sunday is given up to work, and the afternoon to pleasure. That which can elevate man is often despised; but that which degrades him is sought after. On Sunday children cause the greatest anxiety, and servants the greatest annoyance. On Sunday evenings, above all other days, does the wife anticipate the return of her husband with a fore-boding heart. Drunkenness and riotousness celebrate their triumphs on Sunday; and most of the misdemeanours are committed on that day, or are intimately connected with the misuse of it. We turn, therefore, to our own people with the urgent request that they would, in their various spheres, endeavour to procure for the Sunday a more honourable observance in our land. If the Sunday acquires a different character, the national life will rest upon surer basis. Wilhelm von Humboldt justly said that the future of our nation depended upon the observance of Sunday. The Sunday question is not that of a party, but the common cause of all who have the good of the people at heart. Not merely the Church, but the State and the family as well, must demand and promote a right observance of Sunday." "And yet this is the day which certain friends of the people wish to extort from them, false friends that cheat them with the name of liberty, thinking only of their bodily needs, and not wisely even of these." 1616 "Let me tell you a fact which may be interesting to you. On entering the principal church, the Church of the Holy Trinity, we were surprised to find a placard just at the entrance announcing that a Mass was celebrated there every Saturday to deprecate the Divine vengeance on France for the desecration of the Sabbath." "Be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body." 1617 "The Lord's Day is one of the greatest boons ever given by God to man. It is absolutely necessary to enable him to bear the wear and tear of six days' work. In these times of pressure and hurry, it is only through the institution and observance of the Sabbath that the mass of the people can enter into the full enjoyment of that great and blessed gift of God to man—domestic happiness." "Of all divine institutions, the most divine is that which secures a day of rest for man—for is the corner-stone of civilisation, and its
 1618 "Speaking now as a working man, I think it safer to remain as we are. I do not find the restrictions of the Sunday so very rigorous. I can do much as I please; I can stay at home or go abroad; keep sober or get drunk; dig my garden or range the fields; attend a place of worship or go a ratting; study the sciences or read my Bible; and if Done of these will satisfy I can, for sixpence, buy all the news of the week. But, say my opponents, the museums are closed, and we cannot enjoy ourselves unless they are open, not on six days only but on the seventh also. I hold the Sabbath as a Divine ordinance—not subject to any abrogation by any human authority. On this day, as now kept, I feel myself a man; during it I can enjoy quiet hours, not subject, so far as trade is concerned, to the commands of any one." "If ever our present Sunday and its form of observance be done away with, it will be to old England a day of mourning, lamentation, and woe. In conclusion, let me say I love museums as much as any of their warmest advocates, but rather than give up my Sunday, let them sink into those primary rocks from which some portion of them came." "Asa toiler during six days of the week, I feel the relaxation of Sunday simply life itself, therefore if anyone infringes upon my privileges let him be assured of my earnest hostility. But if my liberty in this respect can only be obtained by robbing someone else of the same right, I scorn, to seek it at such a price. Relaxation I must have, but I do not think I could best accomplish my purpose by exchanging the din of the workshop for the crush of the excursion train. The question is one for the working classes. If the thin end of the wedge only tickles the fancy and gives pleasure, let us beware lest workshop and factories follow in the wake, and we get seven days' work for six days' wages. On these grounds alone, I believe the man who encourages Sunday labour is the foe of the toiling multitude." 1619
(9.55.)  MR. A. SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I am glad to find the Lord Advocate offers no opposition to this Motion. The right hon. Gentleman seems to express a preference for the Sheriff's Court over the Crofter Commission.
 MR. A. SUTHERLAND : Yes, that there should be an appeal from the order of the Commission to the Sheriff's Court. Bat I should prefer to see any such power left with the Commission entirely rather than to have the power vested in the Sheriff's Court. I also wish to say in regard to the difficulties expressed by the hon. Member for the Partick Division, that, although I have had considerable experience of these matters in the Highlands, these difficulties between individual crofters are entirely new to me. I support with pleasure the Resolution of my hon. Friend the Member for Leith. I have no exception to take to

 MR. A. SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether his attention has been called to the fact that Mr. Mackenzie, Sheriff Substitute

(4.35.)  MR. JEFFREYS  (Hants, Basingstoke) : I agree with the hon. Member that this proposal will give rise to great irritation. It may be that land is let on an improving lease at a nominal rent, on condition that it is brought into cultivation; and it seems to me, when the tithe owner comes for his tithe, it will be an easy thing for him to prove that the rent of the land is insufficient to pay it. A very low rent may be taken for a few years, say a nominal rent of £5 for a farm of 100 acres; and the farmer may contract to bring the farm into a proper state of cultivation. Under the clause it seems to me the landlord will get free, but the tithe owner will come on the land and distrain.
 MR. JEFFREYS : But how will he be made to do this?
 MR. JEFFREYS : If that is the case, that does away with the objection to a great extent; but it will not be always understood in that way, and many will have a very different view of the

 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member cannot do that. He must vote against the clause.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Yes.
 MR. C. DYKE ACLAND  (Cornwall, Launceston) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether it is the fact that certain parts of the 6in. Ordnance Survey, with contour lines, are ready, but are being withheld until the first edition (which, having no contour lines is incomplete) has been sold out; and as the delay so caused may be prolonged indefinitely, whether he will direct the complete edition, which is much desired, to be issued for sale forthwith?
 MR. DARLING  (Deptford) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether it is in contemplation to re-establish sittings for the trial of causes at the Guildhall or elsewhere in Middlesex than at the Royal Courts of Justice; and whether the accommodation at the Royal Courts is insufficient for the Judges of the Queen's Bench Division in the matter of Courts for the trial of causes with a jury?
 MR. DARLING : Arising out of that answer, may I ask if it is proposed to provide sufficient accommodation in the Royal Courts?
*(9.14.)  MR. FRASER - MACKINTOSH  (Invernessshire) : The hon. Member for Leith has done good service in bringing this matter before the attention of the House, though I regret that his Motion is not more comprehensive in its character. One of the most pressing grievances which came before the Crofter Commission of 1883 was that relating to the question of grazing and the stock upon club farms. It was so very pressing that our Chairman, Lord Napier, laid down some very stringent rules with regard to the management of club farms, but the Act of 1886 to a great extent ignored the point. The grievance
 1586
 MR. C. W. GRAY : I said I hoped so.
 MR. C. W. GRAY : Let me explain. I did not make a proposal with any idea of it being accepted; I only suggested that something in that way might be done.
 MR. C. W. GRAY : I hope the House will not agree with the clause. My reasons are these. We have always understood that the cardinal principle of the Bill was that the tithe rent-charge should be recoverable from the landlord, and the landlord only. In accepting this clause from the House of Lords we should be departing from that principle. I admit that the point raised in the clause is a fair one to raise. I think that the interests of the tithowner ought in some way to be protected; no one wishes to defraud him of his legal right. But this clause reverts to a principle which all have condemned, namely, the power of distraint on the tenant-farmer's property. That principle is objectionable, and I hope the House will refuse to listen to any proposal of that sort whatever. I know that there is a difficulty in the matter, but it has not arisen from any fault on the part of those who take an interest in the tithe payers' position. The difficulty has arisen from the drafting of the Bill as it is proposed to amend it by those who take a special interest in the tithe-owner. There may be collusion between a landlord and tenant to so reduce the rent as to escape the tithe; and there may be a perfectly genuine and business arrangement for the payment of a merely nominal rent in consideration of money spent by the tenant on buildings and improvements. Certainly it is not fair in either case that the titheowner should be deprived of his tithe. As the landlords will object to be rendered personally liable for the insufficiency of the rent to pay the tithe, the only way out of the difficulty is to send the Amendment back to the House of Lords to be re-drawn. I would suggest that in the cases provided for under the clause—and there will not be very many of them—the titheowner should allow the tithe which has been sanctioned by the County Court to remain as a debt owing from the landlord until such time
 1543
(3.0.)  MR. C. W. GRAY  (Essex, Maldon) : I beg to move that the House do disagree with the clause as amended.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : The Second Reading will, if possible, be taken today. I understand there is no difference of opinion among the Vestries as to the necessity for amending and consolidating the Law regarding Public Health in London, and that objection is likely to be raised only against certain clauses in the Bills.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I understand that the objections entertained by Local Authorities are such as can be most properly considered in Committee.

*(2.15.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : The hon. Gentleman says that the House accepted the principle of the Water Charges Bill. Now, it is quite true that the Bill was read a second time, but the House did not commit itself to the principle of the measure; it simply said that it should go before the Committee. The hon. Gentleman asks that this Bill shall

 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam : The Secretary of State's attention has been called to the accident at the Gartsherrie Iron Works, and he is now in communication with the Secretary for Scotland with regard to the question, whether a special inquiry shall be held into all or any of these accidents.
*(12.5.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam : I interpose in this Debate for a short time to explain why, although on a former occasion I was one of those who in the ardour of political youth supported this Motion, I do not feel I can do so on the present occasion. Nine years ago when this Motion was discussed in the House I supported it and expressed my conviction that among the working classes, or among a considerable number of them at all events, there was a strong demand for enlightened, and even for artistic recreation on the Sabbath day. In voting against this Motion to-night I by no means abandon that conviction. With regard to the opening of art galleries and museums on Sundays, we ought to pay regard almost solely to the wishes of the working classes in the matter. We have not to please ourselves but the

 MR. STUART WORTLEY : Really hon. Members must allow me to place my own interpretation on the Motion which, being placed before the House, is public property. On the grounds I have stated, I cannot vote for the Motion.
 *MR. STUART WORTLEY : I cannot regard the Trustees of the British Museum as being entirely independent of the Government of the country. Their action could not but be interpreted as setting an example to be followed by Trustees and other Public Bodies. In supporting the Motion on a previous occasion, I received no sign of approval from those whose virtues we are bound to respect, but rather the contrary; and so far as one can judge in the light of subsequent experience, the opinion of the working-classes, if it sets in any direction, is rather against the proposal. In these days the demand is for a restriction of the hours of labour, and we who think that these proposals for restriction are in themselves most disputable, must, on our part, do nothing which can be construed into an unnecessary extension of those hours of labour. In these days of continually increasing pressure upon the mental

 MR. WARMINGTON  (Monmouth, W.) : Regarding this question from a depositor's point of view, and knowing that the depositors are not fully represented in the management of these banks, I feel that they require the protection that would be afforded by this clause, and, therefore, I trust that the Government will stand firm in maintaining it.
 MR. D. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the fatal
 1535
*(6.25.)  MR. E. BRODIE HOARE  (Hampstead) : I beg to move the omission of Clause 11, and I do so as a protest against the further extension of the limit of deposit in these excellent benevolent institutions bolstered up by Government credit, which compete most unfairly with private and other banks, especially in small towns. I cannot but think that the reason given in the Bill for the change is most inadequate. It is that difficulty has arisen about the due apportionment of principal and interest. If the Trustees of these banks cannot see the difference between principal and interest, they are not fit for their position. It is only due to the enterprise of banks in the country that they should have fair competition, and not to the unlimited competition of the Government for deposits, which are to them their very life-blood.
*(11.20.)  MR. NORRIS  (Tower Hamlets, Limehouse) : This is a very important and difficult subject to deal with; but, so far as I know it, I believe the feeling of the people of London to be decidedly against the opening of museums and galleries on Sundays. It was stated just now that consent had been given to the opening of the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh—but these gardens scarcely come within the category of museums and galleries.
 *MR. NORRIS : It appears to me that the better class of working men like to spend their Sundays in the open air, and, as it were, to receive sermons in stones. The hon. Member for St. Pancras referred to the fact that the People's Palace, of which I am a Trustee, is open on Sundays, and I believe I was the only man who protested against it being open except for the performance of sacred music. It appears to me that the consensus of opinion is against Sunday opening. Let me quote some opinions which have been uttered on the subject. Lord Beaconsfield, in 1879, voted against Sunday opening, and in his speech he said—
 1620 "Of all divine institutions the most divine is that which secures a day of rest for man. I hold it to be the most valuable blessing ever conceded to man. It is the cornerstone of civilization, and its removal might even affect the health of the people. It (the opening of museums on Sundays) is a great change, and those who suppose for a moment it could be limited to the proposal of the noble Baron to open museums will find they are mistaken." "The religious observance of Sunday is a main prop of the religious character of the country… From a moral, social and physical point of view the observance of Sunday is a duty of absolute consequence." "Believing in the authority of the Lord's Day as a religious institution, I must, as a matter of course, desire the recognition of it by others. But over and above this I have myself, in the course of a laborious life, signally experienced both its mental and its physical benefits—I can hardly overstate its value in this view—and for the interest of the working men of this country, alike in these and in other yet higher respects, there is nothing I more anxiously desire than that they should more and more highly appreciate the Christian day of rest." "It is inexpedient to impose labour upon those who must necessarily be employed if museums and galleries were opened on Sundays, and who are at present exempt from work upon that day." 1621
(6.39.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : The object of the clause is to relieve the Postmaster General from the serious dilemma in which he was landed by his gross mismanagement of the Savings Banks Department. It was rumoured that a specific Bill was to be introduced for the purpose of extending the time by which the Postmaster General is bound to produce his accounts. So far as the Trustee Savings Banks are concerned, I think that this clause might reasonably be allowed. It is obvious that the relations between the Treasury and the Trustee Savings Banks are not such as to lead the Treasury to extend the date for the presentation of accounts unduly; but we know how singularly intimate are the relations between the Treasury and the Post Office, and therefore we know that this power would be too readily used.
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I now move "That this clause do not apply to the Post Office Savings Bank."
(2.19.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : It is quite true that the Committee cannot Report before the 6th of April, but if this question were submitted to them specially I think it would produce a great moral effect. As the right hon. Baronet has pointed out, this Instruction conies upon us with some degree of surprise, and I would suggest that the Resolution should be withdrawn for the present and brought up on a later day.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : Certain proposals affecting promotion in the Army Service Corps have for some time been under the consideration of the Treasury. The answer to this question depends on the decision which may be come to.
 MR. WHITLEY  (Liverpool, Everton) : I beg to move the omission of this clause. There is great objection felt to this clause on the part of trustees of savings banks, because they think it is unfair that they should be over-ridden by the National Debt Commissioners. The clause gives the Commissioners power to examine the accounts of savings banks. A great deal of friction has arisen because the Commissioners have refused to allow the expenses of savings banks. I believe I express the opinion of all savings banks when I say there is no control they dislike so much as that of the National Debt Commissioners. They approve of the Bill, but they think when the Committee of Inspection has been constituted there will be no necessity for the National Debt Commissioners having an  imperium in imperio
 MR. WHITLEY : After what has fallen from my right hon. Friend I will not press my Amendment.
*(12.52.)  MR. DE LISLE  (Leicestershire, Mid) : I had come to the House intending to vote against the Motion but I have been converted to the view
 1640
*(4.46.)  MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : As a Representative of an agricultural constituency, I oppose the clause, and support the appeal made by several supporters of the Government to withdraw the clause, and thus end our discussion. I feel bound to offer one or two objections to the clause, which I hope may add somewhat to the force of the reasons urged why the President of the Board of Trade should re-consider the position he has adopted. The clause obviously undoes the main merit of the Bill, which is that it relieves the occupier from the burden of the tithe, but my objection goes further. This clause, in the most effectual way, sets up a Land Court for the tithe owner and for the benefit of the clergy. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire says, on behalf of tenant farmers, that they are contented with Clause 5; but I say they want something beyond that. In the  Daily News 1563 1564
*(3.55.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : Amendments were moved in Clause B to confine the operation of the clause to cases of collusion, and to limit the operation of the clause to contracts which might be entered into after the passing of the Act. The Government declined to accept those Amendments, and the question is, whether we are to agree to the novel principle introduced by the House of Lords. Considering the manner in which the clause was incorporated, and the short time allowed for discussing it, I think it would be well for the Government to give a further explanation as to the course they intend to pursue. There was a general consensus of opinion last night that the clause is objectionable; and I want to know whether the Government intend to adhere to it, or to take, in regard to it, the same attitude of compromise which they have taken in regard to other Amendments? We have always been of opinion that the cardinal principle of the Bill was that the tithe should be paid by the owner. By this new clause the principle is evaded. It introduces quite a novel principle into the Bill by throwing the responsibility of the tithe back upon the occupier. In certain cases, where land is let at a very low rent, or at no rent, the receiver appointed by the County Court will, under this clause, be able to recover from the occupier, thus placing the occupier in the position of one who has backed the landlord's bill. If there is collusion, the landlord ought to be alone responsible; and if there is no collusion, the effect of the Amendment will be to interfere with the relations between landlord and tenant, and to largely impede the application of capital to industry. Under these circumstances, before proceeding further with the
 1542
(4.45.)  MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S.E.) : I hope the Government will have the courage to cut the knot by withdrawing the clause altogether. From my own experience, I am bound to say I think the clause is most reactionary and retrograde in its tendency, and that it neutralises the best portions of the Bill. My hon. and gallant Friend (Captain Bethell), in defending the clause, put the query, "Where is the money to come from?" I reply, there is no money to come, with land going out of cultivation, and corn at its low price. I do not think the Government will gain much credit from the Church Party by adhering to this proposal, and I would urge them to accept the suggestion tendered
 1562
(4.5.)  CAPTAIN BETHELL  (York, E.R., Holderness) : I am inclined to agree with the Government that as the Church party have already given up something, as those who represent the landlord say, they cannot consent that a personal liability shall be thrown upon him, and as those who represent the tenant avow that, under no conditions, will they make him primarily responsible for the tithe, the present proposal is the best solution of the difficulty. In the case which we are now discussing, the Church has already given way to some extent, and I do not think any further concession can fairly be expected. I therefore hope the Government will abide by this clause.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Yes, Sir; the attention of Her Majesty's Government has been called to the recommendations made in the Second Report of the Western Highlands and Islands Commission. We have discussed most of the points raised in the question of my hon. Friend, and certainly I can hold out a hope that the Government will be able to give effect to some of the recommendations of the Commission.
(5.44.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I hope my hon. Friend will not press this Amendment. My hon. Friend will easily understand that gentlemen who take great interest in this question might find sufficient time to organise the scheme in the first instance but might not be able to devote continued attention to it.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I certainly did not consider that I had made the promise referred to by the hon. Baronet. In some cases there has been laxity which rendered inquiry necessary, but nine-tenths of the Savings Banks are admirably conducted. The question is how to meet the difficulty. I cannot agree to leave out the clause, but I shall see whether any modification can be made in it. I should like the National Debt Commissioners to have some kind of  locus standi
(5.56.)  MR. GOSCHEN : If the hon. Member will move the words as a separate sub-section to follow line 36, I will agree to them.
(5.47.)  MR. GOSCHEN : It seems to me it would be better to insert the words "for the appointment of the Committee and" after the word "scheme."
(5.49.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I have looked carefully into this matter, and I find that the object the hon. Member desires to effect is already covered by the words "and conduct of the business" in line 8.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Member cannot be aware that the rules at present have to be certified by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and that, therefore, this is merely applying to the rules the Committee may make, the law applied to

(5.55.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I do not propose to omit—
 "The National Debt Commissioners shall have power to determine what expenses shall be deducted."
 MR. GOSCHEN : I am afraid that I could not assent to that view, because it would involve the laying down of a guide to the Committee, besides giving permission to some banks, while refusing others. I do not think it is a business which should be carried on.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I am not much inclined to accept this Amendment. This investment business does not really belong to savings banks at all, and I am not prepared to say that it is desirable to extend this class of business. In fact, I think great precautions ought to be taken to separate the two. If we were to prolong the date until 1891 it would give existing savings banks opportunity to engage in investment business. I have endeavoured, as far as possible, not to interfere with the existing business of Trustee Savings Banks. I trust the Committee will not assent to this Amendment.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The Amendment does, to some extent, weaken the clause. Yet a Trustee may perform a certain number of duties though he never attends the meetings. I am informed that in some of the smaller towns it is difficult to get the attendance of Trustees, who, nevertheless, render valua-able service outside the meetings. On the whole, I think the clause should be carried with this modification.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I accept the words that
 "A similar statement shall be sent to the Inspection Committee each year at the same time."
(6.49.)  MR. GOSCHEN : On this I may announce the names of those gentlemen who have been chosen to frame the scheme for determining the appointment of the Inspection Committee, and its powers. They are Mr. Lyulph Stanley, Lord E. Hervey, M.P., Sir A. Rollit, M.P., Mr. John Ellis, M.P., Mr. T. C. Wright, of Lincoln's Inn, a Trustee of the Bloomsbury Bank, Mr. John Ure, Dean of Guild, Trustee of the Glasgow Savings Bank, and Mr. Henry Court, late Assistant Comptroller of the National Debt. It will be seen that three of these gentlemen represent savings banks, three are perfectly independent, and one is an expert, who will advise the Committee on technical matters. I will ask the Committee to allow these names to be put in the Schedule, and if there is an objection taken to any of them it can be brought forward on the Report stage.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : My hon. Friend knows the amount of legislation with which the Government have to contend during the present Session. I do not exclude the idea of proceeding with a Bill on the subject of the Investment of Trust Funds in Colonial Stock, but I am unable to give any definite pledge upon the subject.
(5.59.)  MR. HOWELL : I hope the Government will be firm as to this clause. It seems to me that you might as well get rid of the Bill altogether as omit this clause. I would refer the hon. Member for Everton to what took place at Macclesfield—and I could go into a number of other cases. I ask him to take the Blue Book in his hand and to refer to the evidence, and see if it is not absolutely necessary that this clause should remain. It deals with the only authority, at present, who has any power in these matters, and they only have it to a very limited extent. It seems to me that rather than try to take the power away, our anxiety should be to try to extend it. What we ought to do is to legislate for the depositors in such a way as to secure that there shall be perfect safety in the management of the Trustees. What the depositors require is absolute security, and unless the National Debt Commissioners have some controlling power over

(5.41.)  MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : I beg to propose the verbal Amendment which stands in my name.
*(4.15.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : It might have been all right if the Bill had not been made retrospective. I always thought that this clause was the worst clause in the Bill, and every speech I
 1555
 *MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : On looking at the whole question, I am disposed to think that the Bill would be better without this clause. The very scope of the Bill is to interpose a new body, so as to avoid, as far as may be possible, the Government being rendered responsible for the working of the Savings Banks. This clause does not appear to me to touch the security or the safety of the Savings Banks. It deals with a comparatively small matter in reference to which, I think, the discretion of the Committee might be trusted, and as to which there is adequate security.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it would not be desirable to extend the business of the banks in this direction, especially the smaller banks, and I support the Government in their view.
(9.56.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : This has been the most carefully circumscribed Debate we have had for a long time. The issue is so narrow that the most fertile imaginations have not carried speakers beyond it, and every hon. Member who has spoken has kept well within the limit the hon. Member for Boston (Mr. Atkinson) laid down in his Bill for the limitation of the duration of speeches. There is not a word in the speech of the Lord Advocate to which I can take exception, and I think he suggested a very good Amendment to the proposal when he recommended that the services of the Commissioners should only be called in when wanted. That is a condition of legislation I should like to see more of in the House. I have read the section upon which my hon. Friend the Member for Ross seemed to rely for his suggestion that the Commissioners already have this power, and as to which the Lord Advocate does not take a similar view. It appears to me that the section applies to grazing in connection with enlargement of holdings under the Act, and we know, therefore, that the section will not have a very wide application at present. My hon. Friend brought forward this Motion with the hope that, being accepted by the Government, it would be met by a Bill from the Government Bench. That, it seems, is not to be the case, but we are far from complaining of the suggestion of the Lord Advocate that the difficulty should be met by a Bill from this side of the House. This Debate has been limited because the Resolution is limited in its terms; but when a Bill is brought forward from this side of the House, I know from private conversations with my hon. Friends on this subject, that the Bill will not be so limited; it will be of a very different nature, and I earnestly trust that our legislative proposals will be accepted in as amicable, reasonable, and statesmanlike a manner as this Resolution has to-night been received.
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : I understand that entirely.
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : There has been no appeal, and, as in many other cases, it was on the ground of the expense that no appeal was made. We know that in other cases appeals have been made again and again, and have failed because the Assessment Authorities
 1550 1551
(3.44.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : Sir, I think the right hon. Gentleman has met my Friend very fairly. It is very important his argument should be met, because I think it really touches a very important part in this clause. We are not dealing with questions of lands which are let, but with the larger and broader question of depressed agriculture, which I am afraid, after the temporary revival, will be still more depressed. Every one knows that in many cases land, on which the tithe has reached as much as 7s. per acre, has gone out of cultivation, and the wise landlord is anxious to get his land into cultivation, even if he has to
 1549
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : But that order is made before the application.
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : The main objection, however, is a more serious one. Clause 5 enacts that where the annual value of the land is ascertained to be under the tithe rent-charge, remission shall be made. I maintain that the value of the tithe under Schedule B of the Income Tax is, in many cases, above the rack-rent, and this point, if established, must seriously invalidate the argument of the right hon. Gentleman opposite. I know a case in which land which used to let some eight or ten years ago for £1,020 is now rented at £699; and yet the value under Schedule B has never been reduced, in spite of annual applications.
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : Yes; it ought to have been, but it has not. On what ground has it not been reduced? I can understand their saying to the landlord, "You are willing to let your land to a good farmer for so much below the full value; but we think the value is over what the tenant pays, and we shall go on taxing the land at its full value."
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : It is not the case that certain parts of the 6in. Ordnance Survey with contour lines are ready, but are being withheld until the first edition has been sold out. The publication of the second edition of the 6in. map with contours is gradually proceeding, without reference to the fact whether the first edition has been sold out or not. But, owing to the pressure of work in the Ordnance Survey Department, it will be some time, I am afraid, before the publication can be completed.
(5.13.)  MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : In the interest of the tithe owner, I should like to point out a flaw in the clause. The tithe owner has to wait for three years before there are arrears. Then he goes to the Court, which has the owner before it. It may be discovered that the owner is not the occupier, whereupon the Court may appoint a receiver. The receiver may come to the Court and inform it that there is not sufficient to satisfy the tithe. Then the Court makes an order that the occupier shall be treated as owner. Why, when the owner is before the Court, cannot the Court ascertain whether there is any collusive arrangement? Why put the poor tithe owner to all this trouble? Surely the wisest course would be for the Government to withdraw the clause and see if they cannot simplify the procedure.
 MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India when the authorities in Burma set aside the regulation dated from Mandalay, 19th March, 1886, stating that "no shops whatever will be licensed for the sale of opium?"
 MR. HERBERT GARDNER : With great respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I can out of his own lips show that the clause is unjustified, because in defending the Bill he has taken the ground that its object is to do away with the responsibility of occupier under the Act of 1836. I do not think that it is sufficient explanation to say that a tenant must enter into his contract with his eyes open. The hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite said the problem was almost impossible of solution, and in that contention he takes the view of the Prime Minister, who said, with this Amendment of Lord Selborne before him, that the question was so surrounded with difficulties on every side that no proposal could be entirely satisfactory, and then the noble Lord went on to say that the proposal in the Amendment was somewhat clumsy. So it comes to this: that this unhappy clause which we have rightly been debating so long, this clause which is the result of the wisdom of the House of Lords, led by the acumen of that infallible lawyer, Lord Selborne, has been 'denounced by the Prime Minister as "clumsy." Then we have had a speech from the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen), and in that speech we may read the expression of the general opinion outside this House. My hon. Friend spoke with two voices: he spoke against the clause, but then he proceeded to say he should vote with the Government as a faithful follower of his Party. Well, if the Government have still any doubt
 1561
(4.39.)  MR. HERBERT GARDNER  (Essex, Saffron Walden) : I congratulate the hon. Member who has just spoken upon the course he is about to pursue, for I hope he will be true to his political record, and vote for putting the responsibility for tithe upon the landlord. We have had some interesting speeches from the other side of the House. Whether they have been interesting to right hon. Gentlemen on the Treasury Bench I do not know. There has been very little support to the clause in those speeches. There was a speech from the hon. Member for Hertford (Mr. A. Smith), who declared, as a Representative of tenant farmers, that they would be content with their position under Clause 5; but I observed he did not give the reasons why they should be content; he simply gave it as his  ipse dixit 1560
(3.52.)  MR. H. T. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN  (Kent, Faversham) : It is my intention to vote with the Government on this question, and for this reason: I think that the operation of this clause 'will be very small, and that it has been very much misrepresented—though not intentionally—and very much exaggerated by speakers on the other side of the House. I also think that the hon. Member for Maldon (Mr. Gray) and his friends have not been quite fair in the description they have given of the Bill. The hon. Member for Maldon has said he looks on the Bill as one founded on compromise, and give and take.
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the attention of Her Majesty's Government has been called to the. recommendations relating to Shetland and the Mail Service thereto, contained in the recent Report to the Secretary of State for Scotland made by the Western Highlands and Islands Commissioners, and in particular to the following suggestions therein made, namely, that Her Majesty's Government should grant a guarantee of 2½ per cent. for four years on the capital required to enable the Highland Railway Company to extend their line to Gills Bay; that there should be a mail service to Shetland at least thrice a week in winter and four times a week in summer; that additional lights should be placed on certain

(6.59.)  MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : What will be the business on Monday?
(9.58.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The right hon. Gentleman will allow me to say—for I do not wish him to be
 1596
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : No; what I said was, I thought the duty of laying down regulations might properly, and to a large extent, be left to the Commission; but that violations of these regulations should be dealt with by the ordinary tribunals as breaches of contract.
(9.35.)  THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : It may be advisable at this stage to state the views of the Government on this Motion. The hon. Member who has just spoken has intimated that certain high authorities are of opinion that the existing law is sufficient to meet the specific grievance, clearly and frankly put forward by the hon. Member for Leith. I shall await with interest for the disclosure of their names. What is the grievance which is stated to exist? All who are acquainted with the Highlanders are aware that many of the crofters, in addition to the generally small patch of ground of which they are the sole occupants, have aright of grazing over a common piece of ground. Before the passing of the Crofters' Act the adjustment of the rights  inter se 1590 inter se 1591 "That the Crofters Act, 1886, should be amended in so far as to confer upon the Commission powers to regulate the conditions and management of crofters' common grazings." 1592
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I think the hon. Gentleman had better put it down for some day after Easter.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : Parliament determined that among others the Chairman of County Road Trustees should sit  ex officio ex-officio
(6.43)  MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : If the date now fixed is too early, the proper thing to do is to alter it and fix some other date, but not to vest this general dispensing power in the Treasury. But a better method still would be to increase the staff, so that it should be adequate to the work to be done. I think the difficulty the Postmaster General is in is due not to any unreasonable unwillingness on the part of the Savings Bank clerks to work overtime,
 1580
(12.10.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : I have listened with more astonishment than I can express to the speech we have just heard, and pity the hon. Gentleman for the position in which he has foundered himself. He evidently desires—from conscientious reasons no doubt—to go into a different Lobby to that he entered nine years ago and thinks it necessary to give some reasons for the change in his opinions. But let me in a few moments analyse these reasons. The hon. Gentleman believes this is a question for local option, and so he thinks it is wrong for the State to take the lead. Now, that would be a very fine position for the hon. Gentleman to take up if the State had always refrained from taking any action in this direction; but I ask the hon. Gentleman how can he square his theory with the 'action the State has in many instances adopted? Already there are several public institutions which are not local property, but State property, which are supported out of funds voted by this House, and which are by the consent of the Government open on Sundays. The State has, then, taken the lead, and if my memory serves me rightly the State took the lead before any of these local institutions. The State has taken the lead in the case of public institutions in Dublin, in the case of Hampton Court Palace, Greenwich Hospital, and Kew Gardens. What, then, becomes of the

*(9.16.)  MR. PARKER SMITH  (Lanark, Partick) : It is a question open to argument whether the Crofter Act, 1886, requires any Amendment as regards the relation of crofters and landlords, but into that question I do not propose to enter on the present occasion. The Act, however, is deficient in not defending the crofters from each other. In communities of crofters, rights are so thoroughly and completely interlaced that the comfortable conditions and relations of life depend very much on there being some means of determining and loosening these rights from each other. Such matters as over-stocking, bringing down cattle too soon from the hills to the low districts, the cutting of peat, and drainage, are matters which do not concern the landlord in any way, but upon the settlement of which the happiness and the comfort of the crofters depend. In addition to the common grazings, the ground under crop is held in tiny and unenclosed plots. It is in evidence, for example, that on the Torridon Estate the holding of one man consisted of 43 plots—the whole, I suppose, not amounting to an acre. There is no wonder that difficulties of neighbourship arise when rights relating to ground are mixed up in this way. As a crofter expressively put it in a somewhat complex and involved sentence: "We were not understanding one another

 SIR J. POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the Bill which was introduced in the House of Lords by the Government respecting the Colony of Newfoundland has been communicated to the Government of Newfoundland for their observation?
 MR. KEAY : The following question stands on the Paper in my name:—To ask the Lord Advocate whether he is aware that Messrs. W. Anderson, George Smith, James Flett and Sons, Murdo Morrison, and others, fish curers, who hold portions of waste and uncultivated land within 100 yards of high-water mark on the foreshore at Castlebay, Island of Barra, under ten years' leases, and have built thereon sea walls, curing stations, and landing stages at great cost, have received from the agent of the landowner notice to quit on 1st May next, no compensation being offered for the disturbance or for the large outlay which they have incurred; whether he is aware that the sole reason for serving the notices is that these persons, while duly tendering the rent of their stations, have refused to pay the fees charged in their leases for net drying done by the fishermen, which fees the lessees had agreed to collect from the fishermen, but which, since signing the leases, they have discovered constitute an illegal demand on the fishermen, which, if made, would subject them to heavy penalties; and whether it is in accordance with the Law of Scotland that a landowner can terminate a ten years' lease at two months' notice under the circumstances stated, without any compensation to the lessees for disturbance and for the loss of all their outlay? I wish to say that the question has been put down on the Paper by mistake. I had intended to put it down for a later date, and will therefore defer it.
 MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : Will the First Lord of the Treasury kindly say when the Indian Councils Bill will be taken?
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the two colonelcies now vacant in the Army Service Office Corps are to be filled up by promotion in the ordinary way; and, if not, why this is not to be done?
 MR. KELLY : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he is aware that the following advertisement, which appeared in the  Times "To Accountants.—Wanted an experienced accountant, with knowledge of Company and Bankruptcy Liquidation. Salary from £200 to £300 per annum; "
 MR. KELLY : Will the right hon. Gentleman inquire?
(12.49.)  MR. M. STEWART  (Kirkcudbright) : I only wish to say one word before the House goes to a Division. It is said that we on this side contend that the working men of London are not so much in favour of Sunday opening as bon. Gentlemen opposite say they are-Well, I hold in my hand a paper which states that since January over 20,000 working men living in the neighbourhood of the People's Palace have expressed the opinion that that institution ought not to be opened on Sunday. It is clear, therefore, that hon. Members opposite are not entitled to say that all working men are supporters of the Motion before the House.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I never said anything of the kind. What I did say was that persons who entered into contracts should take care what bargains they made.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The occupiers do not pay the tithe rent-charge. The occupiers will pay in the first instance, but ultimately payment falls upon the landowner.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : As I have endeavoured to explain, there are, under the law as it now stands, a considerable number of cases in which the owners take upon themselves to pay the tithe rent-charge where they have let the farm on precisely the terms the hon. Member speaks of, and this will be the case in future.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The owner will pay the tithe.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Has there been no appeal?
*(3.32.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I entirely demur to the view of the right hon. Gentleman as to the object of this clause. It is not the object of the clause to impose liabilities, which ought to rest upon the landlord, upon another person. As has been stated over and over again, it is to prevent the landlord from practically contracting himself out of the liability by agreeing with his tenants on such terms for the occupation of the land as that it shall be impossible for the law to obtain the tithe rent-charge from the rent due to the landlord. As to the effect of the clause, the right hon. Gentleman has discovered what, with all respect to him, I must describe as a mare's nest. He thinks that this clause can be brought into operation in cases where a rack-rent is charged for the land. I demur to that doctrine altogether. The sum ordered to be recovered under the 5th clause of this Bill can never exceed two-thirds of the annual value of the land as assessed to Schedule B of the Income Tax; it therefore never can exceed two-thirds of the rack-rent. So I think it is clear that the clause could not possibly have the operation which the right hon. Gentleman predicts. My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and the Member for Glamorganshire appear to imagine that the clause will prevent those agreements between the landlord and tenant which are often very useful to agriculture, and under which the landlord lets his land either at no rent or a
 1547 1548
*(5.12.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I have no right to speak again, and I only rise to make an appeal to the House. I hope that as we have now discussed the clause for six hours we may be permitted to come to a conclusion. The rest of the Amendments will not raise any serious matter of controversy, and in that case we should be able to finish the consideration of the Amendments to-day, which, I think, would be felt to be for the general convenience of hon. Members.
*(2.21.)  MR. CAUSTON : As a point of order, may I ask whether it is competent for me to put down a further Instruction to the Committee at the time of Private Business?
*(2.13.)  MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : Before this Resolution is put to the House I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman if he will add a further Instruction to the effect that the first matter to be inquired into shall be the Metropolitan Water Companies Charges Bill, which has been referred to the same Committee, the principle of which was accepted by the House, and which will be admitted, I think, to be the most pressing question the Committee will be called upon to inquire into? The Instruction proposed by the right hon. Gentleman, in which I cordially approve, is a most important one, but there are other questions even more pressing, especially when we have regard to the fact that the quinquennial re-valuation is to come into operation on the 6th of April, and that it may affect the ratepayers to the extent of £40,000 a year. I do not at present propose to move an Instruction as an addition to the Resolution of the right hon. Gentleman, but I hope he will see his way to accept my suggestion voluntarily.
*(11.38.)  ADMIRAL MAYNE  (Pembroke and Haverfordwest) : I wish to give support from this side of the House to the Motion of the hon. Member (Mr. Lawson). "We have been told by the hon. Baronet the Member for the City (Sir R. Fowler) he wishes to prevent the desecration of the Sabbath. So do I, and so, I presume, do all hon. Members. The hon. Member for Limehouse (Mr. Norris), who told us he was on the Trust of the People's Palace, said he wished to have sacred music only played on Sunday, but we have found there has been great benefit to the poor people from music, whether sacred or otherwise, which has been played in the

 *SIR R. FOWLER : The hon. Member's reference indicated that the hon. Gentleman generally assented. The hon. Member for Whitechapel (Mr. Montagu) belongs to a community that has been distinguished by the observance of their own Sabbath, in which respect they set us a great example, and can scarcely ignore in this case the principle on which that observance is founded. The hon. Member began his speech by telling us that the House has become more enlightened. Well, for my own part, I do not wish to be enlightened in this respect. I think the Sabbath is a great blessing to the people of the world. I believe it is an institution which God, in His wisdom and mercy, gave to man, and as such I defend it. I, for one, will enter my humble protest against any attempt to desecrate the Sabbath.
 *SIR R. FOWLER : At all events, I do not admit that the County Council is returned to deal with this question, and this is an illustration of the circumstance that the County Council is disposed to interfere with everything except its own business. But what is the opinion of Metropolitan Members who are returned

(9.0.)  MR. MUNRO FERGUSON  (Leith, &c.) : The Motion which I have placed on the Paper refers to a portion of the group of subjects which are embraced under the head of the crofter difficulty, and I have purposely framed the Motion so as to make it of an entirely non-contentious character. The Motion aims at an object which is quite unpolitical; but the question at issue is one which in the public interest should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. It will be in the recollection of the House that under the Crofter Act, 1886, very considerable rights were given to the occupiers of land in certain districts of the Highlands. The crofters acquired large proprietary rights in their holdings, and tenants in townships became part owners of the grazings. But, at the same time, no legal status was conferred upon the men entitling them to be represented in Court, to sue or to be sued. While the power of control in regard to the management of common outruns has been taken out of the proprietors' hands, nothing has been put in its place, and the consequence is that in many townships something very like chaos reigns, so far as the common interest in the grazings is concerned. Lord Napier's Committee reported in favour of conferring corporate powers upon crofter townships. In the Act of 1886 this portion of the Committee's Report was disregarded. Unless some plan is found under which tenants can exercise some effective control over the management of outruns, we shall have

 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury what steps the Government have taken to carry out the Resolution of the House of Commons, adopted on 13th February, relating to Government contracts?
 MR.

 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I did receive the deputation in my official capacity, and I should have been equally willing to receive a deputation from the society represented by the hon. Member had a little longer notice been given me.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH  said: The Government adhere to the attitude taken up on a former occasion, and will oppose the Resolution.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I believe that it will be in my power to satisfy the hon. Gentleman before the Easter Recess.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The question is one of such grave importance that I am sure the House will not expect me to give a hasty answer to it. I have not had an opportunity of conferring with my Colleagues on the question. The telegram only reached us this morning, and I must take time before replying to it. The question comes from a Legislature which is entitled to the utmost consideration, and if the question is repeated on Monday I shall be able to give an answer.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I am not in a position at present to say when it will be taken.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The hon. Gentleman says that because Hampton Court is open on Sundays all public servants in these institutions are to be compelled to work on Sundays. I do not see that we are compelled to adopt the hon. Gentleman's conclusion, and I do not propose to act upon his recommendation. Hampton Court has been opened on Sunday for a great many years. It may not be desirable that it should be closed, but it does not follow because it is open that we should call upon public servants in every museum and picture gallery to work on Sunday. It may or may not be thought desirable by the public authorities in various localities to open such buildings on Sundays. That is a matter they have to determine for themselves. We are the Representatives of the people of the United Kingdom; we have to lay down rules for the guidance of public servants in different parts of the Kingdom; and we are asked, under these circumstances, to say it is our desire that public servants should not have that rest on Sundays to which I certainly think they are entitled. A great deal has been said with regard to the views of the working men. So far as I have been able to ascertain, there is nothing that working men are more jealous about than their Sunday's rest, and they would certainly regard this as an infringement of their right to Sunday rest after their six days' labour.

 MR. JACKSON : No, Sir; I do not think it is part of my duty to inquire.
 MR. JACKSON : I am not aware of any such advertisement as that referred to. Persons engaged by the Inspector General of Bankruptcy are employed and paid by him out of a lump sum supplied to him for the expenses of

 MR. JACKSON : I have no knowledge of the Memorials referred to, or of any grant having been made.
(6.44.)  MR. JACKSON : I am quite willing to accede to the suggestion of the hon. Member, and will bring up a new clause on Report fixing a date. If the suggestion is, as I believe, thrown out in a friendly spirit, I am quite willing now to withdraw this clause on that understanding.
(6.42.)  MR. JACKSON : I cannot accept this Amendment. The only dilemma from which the Postmaster General will be relieved will be to save the clerks of the Department some amount of overtime, to which some of them object. It is obvious it is impossible to present the account by the date prescribed, and I therefore ask that the Treasury shall have power to fix a suitable date. I appeal to my hon. Friend not to press his Amendment.
(6.37.)  MR. JACKSON : It is sometimes found to be quite impossible to present the accounts by the required date, and the result is that the accounts are presented in dummy—an objectionable practice. The Government think the power of fixing a later date might

 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : I understand that the Amendment is not necessary.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : It is perfectly obvious that that is the condition of things which fulfils the wording of this section. Therefore there would be hundreds of tenant-farmers compelled to advance the tithe which ought to be paid by the landlord. No lawyer in this House can controvert this interpretation of the clause; and such an effect is certainly discordant with the declared intentions of the Government. Another consideration is how this clause would operate on Clause 5. The Bill, under that clause, makes provision for reducing the tithe when it exceeds two-thirds of the annual value of the land; but this clause will conflict with and practically overrule that provision, for by it we should come on the tenant and compel him to pay in advance. The Bill professes to relieve the tenant-farmers of England; that has been urged as its great recommendation; but it will have the effect, with monstrous injustice, of making the tenant advance the money which the landlord ought to pay. It has been said that the clause is to apply to beneficial leases, but nine-tenths of those leases are made by ecclesiastical persons or corporations—by the landowners themselves—who would thus throw on the tenants the burdens they themselves ought to bear. A more gross, unfair, I will almost say wicked, injustice can hardly be conceived. Up to a short time since it has been the persistent policy of landowners to shift upon others the burdens they themselves ought to bear. By this Bill the House thought they had got rid of that policy in regard to tithe at least; but now, at the very last moment, the House of Lords makes again an attempt to throw upon the impoverished tenant-farmers of England a burden which the landowners clearly ought to bear. It is impossible to accede to such a proposal. Besides, we have decided that the man who ought to pay the tithe rent-charge is the landowner; then, having done that, why
 1545 1546
(3.10.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I rise to support the appeal of the hon. Member There is one point which I am sure has not been fully appreciated, and which, indeed, has only just been brought to my cognisance. The clause as it stands does very much more than the Government ever intended to do. The Prime Minister has argued that the clause was intended to cover cases of collusion, and it was afterwards declared that it must also embrace those cases where small rents were paid in consideration of sums of money paid down. But, as a matter of fact, the clause affects every case of rack-rent where the tithe is larger

 *SIR A. ROLLIT  (Islington, S.) : I may say that the managers of Savings Banks,

 *SIR A. ROLLIT : The Bill as it stands limits the opening of investment departments of banks to November 1890. These Investment Departments have been attended with excellent results, and have formed one of the most useful features of the banks. Under these circumstances, it seems somewhat hard that the door should be somewhat suddenly, and without notice, closed against the development of this part of the business of the banks. At a representative meeting of the banking interest there was a very general feeling that the period ought to be extended for the formation of these departments.
*(5.3.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : Notwithstanding his speech, I think the noble Lord must see that the general opinion on both sides of the House is that this clause ought not to be passed. I cannot conceive why, under the circumstances, the Government stick to the clause unless they think the Church will derive some benefit. The noble Lord appears to represent both the House of Lords and the

 DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to an accident involving the loss of three lives and the serious burning of a number of men, which occurred at Gartshorrie Ironworks, on Tuesday night; whether he has yet come to any decision as to instituting a special public inquiry into the two fatal and mysterious explosions in ironworks in Glasgow, to which his attention was last week called by Questions; and whether he will include the Gartsherrie accident in the scope of the inquiry?
 *MR. BARTLEY : Many of the Local Authorities are desirous of considering them before they are read a second time.
*(5.43.)  MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : The Amendment that stands next on the Paper in my name raises an important, point. The present scheme of the Bill is for the House to appoint a Committee, which Committee shall appoint a Committee of Inspection. I think it is just as well that the House should itself appoint the Committee of Inspection and insert the names of the members of that Committee in the Bill. My Amendment is that the names mentioned in the Schedule shall be the Committee of Inspection.
 *MR. BARTLEY : After my right hon. Friend's statement, I am content to have the Amendment negatived.
*(5.45.)  MR. BARTLEY : There should be some words inserted to empower the Committee, whose names will be mentioned in the Schedule, to appoint the Committee of Inspection. As the Bill stands, the power would only be given by inference. I beg to move to insert the words "appoint the Committee and" after the word "Commissioners."
 *MR. BARTLEY : I hope the clause will be retained as one that will have a very useful effect, because it will establish a necessary check with regard to these bank expenses. No doubt in the bulk of the Savings Banks of this country these matters are properly looked after; but there are certain cases in which a check is necessary, and that being so I support the retention of this clause.
 *MR. BARTLEY : They appear to me to be an improvement, as strengthening the Committee of Inspection.
 *MR. BARTLEY : Then I will not press the Amendment.
*(5.51.)  MR. BARTLEY : It seems to me that the question involved in this clause is one which may well be left to the Committee of Inspection and the National Debt Commissioners, and that it is a pity to introduce the Registrar of Friendly Societies in the matter. I, therefore, move to omit the latter part of the clause.
 *MR. BARTLEY : Then if the right hon. Gentleman will move that, I will withdraw my Amendment.
*(5.48.)  MR. BARTLEY : The clause does not seem to me sufficiently wide, therefore I have prepared an Amendment, which I will now move.
 *MR. BARTLEY : Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer will accept my Amendment, for it seems a little hard to shut the door for ever. By my Amendment the Commissioners or Committee of Inspection, where they thought it

 *MR. BARTLEY : I think the bankers owe a debt of gratitude to these banks. They have taught thousands the habit of banking, and so largely increased joint-stock banks, which are becoming familiar institutions at so many corners of the streets as almost to be as numerous as public-houses.
(6.51.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I wish to explain that its object is to confirm a Convention by which British mail ships will be put on the same footing as foreign ones. The fact of foreign mail ships possessing the privileges of men-of-war has caused great discontent among British shipowners, who are placed in an inferiority to foreign owners, but they will now be on precisely the same footing. There is a provision that, if a warrant is to be executed on board, notice must be given to the Consular officer, and the ship may be detained for an hour if he is absent at the time. Power is also given to enter into a permanent bail bond, that bail bond and damages claimed under it to be enforceable in the country of jurisdiction, so that any claim against a French ship will be recoverable in London. There is one provision which will require shipmasters to receive on board mails in a port of France as in an English port at the same rates as those fixed by the Postal Union of 1874. It is most important that this Bill should be read a second time this evening, in order that the new Convention may be ratified before the end of the month.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : A telegram was received two days ago from Her Majesty's Minister at Santiago, stating that the Chilian Government now refuse clearances to vessels for ports north of Chamaral. Her Majesty's Government do not consider that they can interfere with the discretion of the Chilian Authorities in regard to this matter. They have not heard of any attempt to prevent vessels by force from leaving Valparaiso for other ports in Chili, and they cannot doubt that such action, if known to Her Majesty's Legation, or to the British Admiral, would have been reported.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : In the unavoidable absence of my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies I will answer the question of the hon. Member for Kilkenny (Sir J. P. Hennessy). The draft of this Bill has not yet been communicated to the Government of Newfoundland. They were requested in November to procure the necessary legislation for empowering Her Majesty's officers to carry out the Treaties with France, and the present Bill is proposed in consequence of their declining to do so, as will be seen by reference to Parliamentary Paper C. 6275, p. 62.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : I have been requested by my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary for India to answer this question. The Order quoted in the question from the Commissioners' Instruction in March, 1886, was modified
 1531
*(2.17.)  SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : The right hon. Gentleman is always so courteous that it is difficult to make a complaint in regard to anything he deems right to do, but I think we ought to have had some longer notice of the Instruction he has moved. It only appeared on the Paper to-day, and in a matter of such great importance I think we were entitled to a longer notice, so that we might have been able to consider the terms of the Instruction. As regards the suggestion of the hon. Member for West Southwark (Mr. Causton) I can quite understand the objection to making it an Instruction to the Committee, but it is obvious that it is a matter which presses for immediate decision, if anything effectual is to be done. I trust I may be allowed to express a hope that the Committee will take that part of the inquiry into consideration at an early stage of their proceedings.
(6.29.)  SIR J. LUBBOCK : It is quite true that the proposal in the present Bill is but small; still, at the same time, it is another step in the direction of Government interference with private enterprise. I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead in expressing my regret that the Government
 1578
 *SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : I am sure we all agree with my hon. Friend in desiring the safety of these banks, but I cannot see that this clause does to any material extent add to the safety of the banks. It refers only to expenses, and surely we might trust that matter to the Inspection Committee. If the Committee cannot be trusted to say what are and what are not necessary expenses, they are not likely to be of any use at all. I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer promised the deputation which waited upon him on the 11th June, 1890, that the question of necessary expenses should be left to the Committee. That being so, I hope the Government will agree to the proposal of the hon. Member for Liverpool.
 *SIR J. LUBBOCK : Does the hon. Gentleman extend that principle to the Trustees of the British Museum?
(11.28.)  SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : I think that the House will perhaps expect me to say a few words with reference to this Motion, as a Trustee of the British Museum, With reference to the results of the evening opening of the Museum, I do not take quite so gloomy a view as the hon. Member for St. Pancras. The number of people attending is now slightly on the increase, and we hope will continue to increase. Undoubtedly, however the figures are very disappointing. The hon. Member for Leicester seems to think that is the fault of the Trustees; he says we are showing how best not to do it; he suggests the best hours for the evening would be from 6 to 8. We, however, have tried opening as he suggests, but we found that from 7 to 8 scarcely any one was present. With regard to Sundays, a large majority of the Trustees of the British Museum are anxious to open the Museum on Sunday. We cordially sympathise with everything that has been said as to the proper observance of Sunday, but we wish to open the museums because we believe that to do so will promote the object we all have at heart. What is the object of a museum? Why does the House annually vote large supplies for the support of the British Museum? Partly, no doubt,

 Sir JOHN MOWBRAY  reported from the Committee of Selection; That they had discharged the following Members from the Joint Committee of the Lords and Commons on the Railway Rates and Charges Provisional Order Bills: Mr. Colman and Sir Henry Selwin-Ibbetson; and had appointed in substitution: Sir Joseph Bailey and Mr. Dickson.

*(5.15.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I venture to ask the House to consider what were the leading principles of the Bill when it was discussed in Committee. The first principle was to take the liability to pay tithe off the occupier and lay it on the landowner; and the second was that the landowner should not be personally liable for the tithe. When the Bill got to the House of Lords, Lord Selborne said that as the personal liability of the landlord had been withdrawn, he could not see his way to ask the House to take off the 5 per cent. reduction, which had been proposed by Her Majesty's Government more than once in previous Bills during this Parliament. The whole spirit of the former Bills was to put a personal liability on the landowner, and, in consideration of that, 5 per cent. was to be taken off the amount of the tithe as

 SIR R. WEBSTER : That is not a question for me to determine, but ought to be addressed to the First Commissioner of Works. That the accommodation in the Courts is insufficient is a fact very well known.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : No.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : It ought to have been.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : No.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : He cannot do that; there must first of all be an order.
(4.21.)  MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : It is not necessary for me to say much, as all the arguments which can be used against this proposal have already been advanced. By that I do not mean to suggest that those arguments are in themselves weak. The fact is, we have bad no arguments put forward in its favour. I do not wish to infuse any heat into this Debate, although the manifest injustice of the clause would warrant me in doing so. I am satisfied that if those who intend to vote for the clause would listen to the arguments against it, the Government would be defeated. This is not a case where the tithe owner comes in. It is admitted on all sides that the tithe owner must have his tithe. The question is, how is he to

(12.40.)  MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch Haggerston) : I should not have interposed in this Debate, especially at this late hour, but for the extraordinary statement that has just been made by the First Lord of the Treasury. The right hon. Gentleman has stated that, so far as he is aware (and I am convinced he has only said what he believes to be true) the working-men have a great regard for the Sabbath. I share that opinion. Working men do not fear—and that is the point of difference between them and the right hon. Gentleman—that the opening of museums on Sunday will jeopardise in any way the sacred character of the Sabbath. Let me supply a proof. The right hon. Gentleman made an assertion, but gave us no proof. I am going to supply him with information which I think it is very necessary should be at the disposal of the House,
 1638 en masse 1639
 VISCOUNT CRANBORNE : I am not sure of that. I have good legal authority for saying there is much doubt on the point whether in law he could recover. Another hon. Member said it is a very common practice in England to let land at a nominal rent for one or two years, and maintained that in such cases this clause will act very hardly. Who pays the tithe now? I know the case of property with which I am intimately connected where precisely the same thing was done. The land had got into bad order. The late tenant was bankrupt, and allowed the land to get into a poor condition. The land was let to a new tenant at a nominal rent for the first year, for a little more the second year, and it was not until the fourth year that the full rent was charged. Of course, under the provisions of this Bill, the tithe owner has a remedy against the landlord in the first instance, and if it is shown that the occupier receives benefit from the particular method of letting, which the landowner and the tenant have agreed upon for their own purposes, then the tithe owner loses his money. Surely hon. Members will not say that when the land really produces sufficient to pay the tithe rent-charge the tithe owner should lose his right to tithe simply because of some special arrangement between the landlord and tenant. This matter has been very carefully considered, and of all the proposals made this is found to be the only one which is at all feasible. It is admitted that there is a difficulty to be grappled with, and therefore I earnestly hope the Government will adhere to the clause.
 VISCOUNT CRANBORNE : But nothing in the way my hon. Friend suggests could be done. This is the point I want to place effectually before the House. My hon. Friend proposes that the debt should remain a charge against the landowner. Now let me take an extreme case to show how impossible it is that his Amendment could meet the difficulty. Suppose a landlord let land to a relative at a nominal rent, a penny a year it may be, and suppose the landowner refuses to pay the tithe rent-charge, under the provisions of this. Bill a receiver would be put in and receive the rents and profits of the land
 1565
(4.55.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE  (Lancashire, N.E., Darwen) : I am reluctant to rise, but it is assumed that we all join in the objections because we do not rise to reply in defence of the clause. There is a strong feeling among hon. Members on this side that we ought to persist in agreeing with the Lords' Amendment. I am quite conscious how important the matter is; but the real fact is, hon. Members opposite rise so often and prolong their observations to such inordinate length that we get little chance to intervene. The right hon. Gentleman told us that any lawyer would say he is right in his conception of the clause. I do not pretend to be a lawyer, but I have read the clause and the Bill, which I do not know that he has; and as I read it it seems perfectly evident that the rack-rent never could be less than the tithe; for, under the 5th clause, the tithe will never be allowed to be more than two-thirds of the rack rent. The difficulty we have to deal with was first pointed out by the hon. Member for Glamorgan on a former occasion, and he made a proposal which the Government did not see fit to accept, and I think he himself admitted it would scarcely work. Then the Bill went to another place, and we have the conclusion arrived at there for meeting the difficulty. Now my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon, not satisfied with the proposal, has gone the length of proposing a remedy of his own.

 MR. J.

 MR. FLNLAY  (Inverness, &c.) : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will persevere with the Motion, as great interest is taken in the matter in Scotland.
*(7.41.)  SIR J. POPE HENNE3SY  (Kilkenny, N.) : Before the right hon. Gentleman replies I wish to call his attention to an important recommendation of the Commission. It is a recommendation that ought not to escape the criticism of the House. The Report proposes to stereotype the system under which admission to the Foreign Office is gained by nomination, and not by open competition. The time has come to consider whether we are prepared to support that system. It is said you must have a certain number of clerks on whom you can implicitly rely. Clerkships in the Admiralty and the War Office are thrown open to competition, and it cannot be said that there are never any secrets to be kept in those Departments. Clerks are also appointed in the Colonial Office by open competition. They are entrusted with the most secret and confidential work, and they do it as faithfully as the Foreign Office clerks. What occurs with regard to many of the most confidential cypher telegrams? They pass through both Offices. Take the case of Newfoundland and France. I suppose that not a single telegram relating to the pending question of Newfoundland has not passed through the hands of clerks in the Colonial Office as well as in the Foreign Office. In 1859 a Committee was appointed on my Motion, which threw open the whole of the Civil Service to competition; but it made an exception with regard to the Foreign Office. Great changes have occurred since then. England has become more of a Colonial and less of a Continental Power. Why the old line should still be drawn and why one office in the State should be so exceptionally treated it is difficult to understand. With regard to the suggested consolidation of the Consular and Diplomatic Services recommended by my hon. Friend (Mr. Labouchere). It is much better to keep them separate. It was the practice in China and Japan to amalgamate them, but the plan did not work well, and Lord Salisbury wisely altered it. The recommendations contained in the Report of the Commissioners, with the exception of that by which it is sought to stereotype the present exclusive system of appointments to clerkships in

(10.40.)  DR. McDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : In seconding the proposals of my hon. Friend it is not necessary that I should again go over the ground he has traversed to such advantage. The hon. Member, in the earlier part of his speech alluded to the number of Commissions which have sat upon questions relating to the Highlands. We have had a great many Commissions which have dealt with the Highlands, some beneficial and some useless; but I think that nothing has approached the slovenly way in which this Commission did its work. The Commissioners scuttled from place to place; they went to Ullapool; they saw nobody, they went away, and express an opinion as to what should be done, and so on in other districts. I should go beyond the terms of the Motion were I to say much upon this, but I may say that great dissatisfaction exists in the Highlands as to the way in which the Commissioners performed their duties. There are some wise recommendations in the Report, but there are some that are very unwise. As to this recommendation of a steamer for the West Coast of Lewis, everybody knows, who has any knowledge of the Island, that it is stupid to talk about such a thing. I marvel that, even with their summer experience, they could recommend such a thing. It has on all sides been repudiated as ridiculous in the extreme. There are but three or four months in the year that a steamer could go there; it is one of the wildest places on the whole coast of Scotland. This one recommendation shows that the Commission did not go very fully into matters they were appointed to look

(11.58.)  MR. CONTBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : So far as his main proposition goes, there is a considerable amount of reason in what the right hon. Gentleman says. Of course, he occupies his present position simply as trustee for the public, and I cannot for a moment, myself, complain of his doing his duty. It appears that the Post Office Act has been infringed, and, therefore I do not wish to complain of what has been done by the right hon. Gentleman. Still that does not "preclude the desirability of obtaining the decision of the Courts of Law as to one point of the operation of this company. But I take leave to

 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H.

The subject is receiving the careful attention of Her Majesty's Government, and it is not possible to make any statement at present.

 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : The delay in dealing with applications for promotion of Second Division clerks is due to various causes, among others, the question of fixing a normal establishment for the Department of the Accountant General, and the creation of a new Department of Ordnance in which one or two of the best Second Division clerks may be included with higher pay. I hope that shortly it will be possible to deal with these applications, each of which will receive careful consideration.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : Provision has been made for drilling Royal Naval Reserve men abroad, serving in vessels subsidised by the Admiralty, and this will include arrangements at Hong Kong for men serving in steamers running between that port and Esquimalt which earn the Admiralty subvention.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : No special instruction of the kind suggested by my hon. Friend seems necessary, as the Committee have power to take evidence, and they would naturally take the opinions of those who have the most practical experience on the subjects upon which they are directed to Report?
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : Sydney is, and remains, the headquarters of the Royal Navy in the South Pacific, in the sense that Admiralty stores are kept there; but the ports of other colonies will be equally visited by Her Majesty's ships, and serve as bases in the event of war. The Admiralty will cease to have any interest in land which is surrendered in exchange for land more suitable for naval requirements. The "Imperial purposes" for which the naval establishments are maintained are primarily the defence of Australasian commerce, and Her Majesty's Government are fully satisfied with the conditions under which the land will be held, which have been agreed upon by Her Majesty's Government and the Colonial Government.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : I would not put it in that way. We have an absolute right of ownership of a certain part of the land, and other land is now being transferred to us.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : We have not the Government contracts.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : This matter is now under consideration; but as it involves questions beyond those connected with the improvement of the position and pay of ships police, it requires very careful investigation, and a final decision has not yet been arrived at.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : The Committee on the Gibraltar Dock reported last year; but considering the many urgent demands made upon naval finance, and the amount of work of various kinds now in hand, it was considered desirable not to begin the work until a large sum could be annually applied to it, and its construction rapidly and continuously pushed forward. An extension of the Mole would be part of the scheme.

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The General Prisons Board report that Mr. Dillon had for a few days a slight internal complaint, but that he reported himself well on Friday morning.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I assume that the hon. Member refers to the provisions of the 29th section of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887. It is the case that the variations of judicial rents throughout Ireland, under that section, only applied to the rents which accrued due for the three years commencing from the first gale day in the years 1887, 1888, and 1889. The half year's rent due in November, 1890, was therefore not affected.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : Relief works have been arranged, and are now in progress. I cannot say anything about Kilmovee at present.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Land Commissioners report that the holding referred to was put up for sale as stated in the question. There being no bidders, the sale was adjourned, but not abandoned, as the Commissioners have reason to believe that a sale will be effected. No evidence or complaint reached the Commissioners that the purchase was made under threat of eviction. On the contrary, the terms appear to have been favourable to the tenant. The Poor Law valuation of the holding was £23, the judicial rent was £30, which, by the sale, was considerably reduced, the purchase annuity being £20 in respect of the purchase money of £500 agreed upon. The Commissioners do not apprehend any loss whatever in regard to the transaction.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Commissioner of Police reports that no charges have been made against the police officer mentioned, except those referred to in previous questions put by the hon. Member in 1888. As then stated, the charges were groundless.

 MR. CONYBEARE : I have one or two Amendments on this, and as I believe the Government are determined to press this Bill through to-morrow afternoon, when I may not be able to be present, I hope the hon. Member will not press his Motion.
 MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of Statefor India (1) whether he supports the statement made in the official "Collection of Papers relating to the Excise Administration of India" (page 334), issued by the Government of India in 1890, that there exists only one opium den in the Akyab district of Lower Burma, or has he any further information which would support the statement that there are over 1,000 opium dens in that district; and (2) what is the total amount of opium consumed in Upper and Lower Burma in the years 1887, 1888, and 1889, respectively and separately?
 MR. SCHWANN : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India (1) whether he is aware that a Government tenant, Russ Ram by name, farming 17 acres in the Jolesar Tahsil, Etah District, North-West Provinces, whose Kharif and Rabi crops in 1887 were of the value of Rs.321 90, paid as rent Rs.306, being 95 per cent. of the gross produce; (2) whether his attention has been called to the following cases cited in the Report on the economical condition of the Agricultural and Labouring Classes of the North-West Provinces of India (1886): Aba Ram, a cultivator of 21 fields in Nanganm, Payana Chhata, whose gross yield in 1887 was Rs.70 4 0, the sum of Rs.68 15 0 was taken for rent and canal dues, being 99 per cent. of the gross produce; Hira Singh and Bhara Singh (brothers), of Hazara, cultivators of 10 acres, whose gross yield in 1887 was Rs.67, the sum of Rs.40 11 G was taken for rent; and Baksha, cultivator of seven acres in the Jolesar Tahsil, District Etah, the gross produce in 1887 was Rs.85, and the rent taken was Rs.40; (3) whether the above cases may be taken as samples of the manner in which the State, as landlord in the North-West Provinces, treats its tenants; and (4) whether any remission of rent or delay for payment was granted; and, if not, under what circumstances are remissions or delays granted?
(9.33.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam : I think everyone sympathises with my hon. and gallant Friend in his trouble in getting an opportunity of discussing this question, and also with his desire to realise to the full the ideal possibilities of these reformatory and industrial ship schools in the way of recruiting the Navy and the Mercantile Marine. But in considering this question the House must remember that this class of schools is entirely founded and managed by private philanthropic enterprise and not conducted for the purpose of profit. Their only connection with the Home Secretary is that the right hon. Gentleman has to see to the enforcement of the conditions on which a certain rate of grant in aid is given by the overnment. The actual net result of the training given in these ships has, undoubtedly, been disappointing. There are 11 of these ship schools in England and Scotland, three of them being reformatories, and eight of them being industrial ships. Among these 11 the  Havannah 1731 1732
 *MR. STUART WORTLEY : The only alternative is to proceed to a system of compulsory transfers, to which course there are obvious difficulties. With regard to the small proportion of boys taken into the Navy from these school ships, I may point out that the Admiralty refuse to take the boys from the reformatory ships, because they have been convicted of some actual offence. That, no doubt, is a proper decision, for they ought not to allow boys of this class to associate with other boys. As regards industrial school boys, the Admiralty requires them to satisfy high physical standards; but I am bound to admit, as regards the industrial school boys, that the physical standard of many of them is not so high as might be desired, and I agree with my hon. and gallant Friend in wishing that the total number of boys who enter the Navy and the Mercantile Marine, from the whole of the schools referred to, were greater than at present, namely, 56 per cent. But there are several difficulties in this, not the least of which is often the wish of the parents at the close of the period of the boy's detention, which may occur as early as 14 years of age, and cannot go beyond 16. It is impossible to deny to respectable parents who still have the right to exercise parental control, a voice in the ultimate disposal of their children's future, and in many such cases their wish is that their children shall not go to sea. It is to be borne in mind, too, that the boys are just at the age, having received a number of years' training and education, to be of use and profit to their parents at home. I admit that the result of the naval training in such schools is not so satisfactory or ample as my hon. and gallant Friend desires. As to the inspection and management of the ship schools, it should be remembered that these particular schools contained only 3,000 children out of about 23,000 in all the industrial and reformatory schools
 1733
 *MR. STUART WORTLEY : And that Admiral is now doing admirable work as an Inspector of Prisons, and it would be very hard to take him away from that duty. However, I have made certain promises to my hon. and gallant Friend, beyond which I cannot go, and I hope he will be satisfied with them, and that in asking us to improve these school-ships, as we shall always seek to do, he will not ask that we should lay them under conditions which might improve them off the face of the earth.

*(11.8.)  MR. HOWARD VINCENT  (Sheffield, Central) : I rise to call attention to certain Commercial Treaties in force between Her Majesty and Foreign Nations, and to the Report of the Trade and Treaties Committee of the Board of Trade. I wish to call particular attention to the Treaty concluded with Belgium on July 23rd, 1862, and to the Treaty with the Zollverein on May 30th, 1865. The Treaty with Belgium of 1862 contains this stipulation—
 "Article VII. Articles the produce or manufacture of Belgium shall not be subject
 1745 "While these two Treaties remain in force the express stipulations above quoted are extended to all countries whose Commercial Treaties with Great Britain contain a mostfavoured-nation clause, and apply to British Colonies." 1746 1747 "Not only have these minimum duties been raised generally to the level of the General Tariff of 1881,  i.e "The effects would, no doubt, be injurious not only to British trade with Franco, but to our trade with the Continent generally, although the chief injury, we may assume, will be to the French people themselves. The extent of the primary losses to be inflicted on our own trade, apart from the more general mischiefs referred to in the previous paragraph, is naturally the subject of very serious complaint from the special interests concerned. In various trades, especially in the woollen, worsted, and other textile trades, the representations made to us are that the proposed tariff will, in effect, prohibit the export of certain articles of manufacture from this country to France, and greatly restrict the export of many others. A measure which can be described as having such effects is, as already indicated, an act of commercial hostility to the country affected; and this attitude towards English trade is, indeed, hardly disguised in discussions of the subject in France." 1748 "This is the question of the hour with us in Canada now. We have just emerged from a dangerous situation with honour, Sir John Macdonald's majority being 35 in a House of 216 Members. Having rejected the proposal for Unrestricted Reciprocity or Commercial Union with the United States, the thinking people of our Dominion are in an attitude of expectancy with their faces turned to the Mother Country. What will she do to help the loyal majority here in their struggle to maintain the integrity of the Empire? "
 MR. HOWARD VINCENT  (Sheffield, Central) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade if he can state what decision has been arrived at with regard to the protest of the Agents General of the self-governing Colonies, presented to the Trade and Treaties Committee of the Board of Trade, against the maintenance of the clause in the

 MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N. E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been drawn to complaints from the mining district round Airdrie, alleging that the provisions of Section 21 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, which requires that daily personal supervision shall be exercised either by the manager or by an under manager, nominated in writing by the owner or agent of the mind, is in many cases habitually neglected; if so, whether he has made inquiry into the complaints, and with what result?
 MR. D. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : What Supply will be taken when the House resumes?
(4.45.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I think the Scotch Members have good reason to complain of the course taken by the Government tonight. I snail, before I sit down, move the adjournment of the Debate. Two reasons mainly actuate me in making this Motion. The noble Lord the Member for Hampshire who told us that there is great joy in Scotland over the action of the Government in this matter is not yet a Scotch Member, and probably never will be. He certainly is not entitled to speak for public opinion in Scotland; all he was justified in saying was that there was great joy in the  Scotsman 1684
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : The suggestion was that you should abandon the Bill.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether he is aware that the majority of Scotch Members left town on the understanding that the Scotch Private Bill Committee would not be taken to-night?
 *ADMIRAL FIELD : I did not suggest that another naval man should be appointed. I asked that the Home Office should use one of their own officers—Admiral Fenwick.
 *ADMIRAL FIELD : I did not advocate the reduction of the grant for one moment. I only want to secure a supply of boys for our ships.
*(8.45.)  ADMIRAL FIELD  (Sussex, Eastbourne) : I am in sympathy with the hon. Member for Aberdeen (Mr. Bryce) who said he had waited nine years in the hope that he would be able to introduce this House to the mountains of Scotland. I have waited for three years to intro-

 *MR. E. STANHOPE : I cannot follow my hon. and gallant Friend's question. Warden Point is in Sheppey, and Shoeburyness on the north bank of the Thames, and it certainly is not intended to fire across the river. The extended range at Shoeburyness is over the sands, nearly parallel to the shore, and no injury to fishing is anticipated.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : I should have thought that my hon. and gallant Friend would have been aware that the dynamite gun differs so essentially from the Brennan torpedo that the weapons cannot be compared; and it is improbable that the adoption of the former, should it occur, would justify the neglect of the latter means of defence. A naval officer detailed for the purpose advised as to, and concurred in, the sites selected for the Brennan Torpedo Stations.
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the evidence in several recent baby-farming cases in which convictions have been obtained for manslaughter; whether he has observed that it appears from the evidence in these cases, and in similar cases, that the children are largely obtained by means of advertisements in daily and weekly newspapers published in London and the provinces; and whether he will take into consideration the advisability of legislating with a view to control or prevent the insertion of such advertisements?
*(5.56.)  MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I think the right hon. Gentleman is amply justified in raising this question, and the time is opportune when we remember that it is only a few days ago that the Government assented to the Second Reading of a Small Holdings Bill, and are themselves pledged to introduce a Bill of their own dealing with small holdings. The Glebe Lands Act was a wise and just measure. I know many clergymen who are good farmers, and many who are not, but whose benevolent intentions exceed their agricultural knowledge. To my knowledge many of them are promoting useful work among labourers in regard to allotments, but, as we are well aware, the great incentive to success in these small holdings is the prospect of being the owner.

*(6.1.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : The right hon. Member for Bradford certainly deserves the thanks of the House for having inaugurated this discussion, and it is to be hoped what he has said may be taken to heart at the Board of Agriculture. It may be that the consideration which ought to be uppermost in the minds of the Land Commissioners is to sell the glebe lands to the highest bidder; but it seems doubtful whether Section 8 of the Glebe Lands Act does not militate against that view, and whether more strenuous efforts ought not to be made to secure a development of the system of small holdings out of the glebe lands. There is no doubt that the profit incumbents obtain by sale is considerably more than the profit they

 MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S. E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the Government proposes to lay out a long range down the coast to Warden Point, Shoeburyness, and on to the Nore Light; and, if so, whether, in view of the serious injury to and destruction of fishing on that portion of the coast, the scheme can be modified?
 MR. BYRNE  (Wicklow, W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether there is any truth in the rumour that the mail car which has been plying between Tinahely, Hacketstown, and Kiltegan for the last eight years is about to be discontinued; and, seeing the great advantage and convenience to the commercial and residential community of the existing system, whether he will make arrangements for the continuance of the present postal service through that locality?
 MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman is aware that statutory accounts required under the Acts in question are accounts of expenditure actually incurred and audited. It is, of course, impossible to furnish such accounts till some time after the close of the financial year, in view of the distance of some places, such as Hong Kong. But I am considering the form of a Return which will give the Exchequer issues to the various Departments during the year.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I think it will be found that some of the items have been written off.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : The situation is as follows:—In the Report of the Controller and Auditor General on the Local Loans Fund the arrears of interest are given, but a great portion of that interest has already been written off as lost, and is kept on the account merely as against the debtor. As regards England, the amounts advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners applied not only to English loans, but to loans made by them in Ireland in old times; the arrears are the accumulations of a long period. Such items as the following are included in the account:—The Ulster Canal, £227,000; Rosslare Harbour, £25,000: Pulteney Harbour, £19,000; and Carlingford Lough, £20,000. The only other considerable item on this account is "Battersea Park," where the arrears of interest were £74,000. In this case the property, consisting of lands adjacent to the park, is in the hands of the Office of Works, who pay over all available receipts to the credit of the loan. In Ireland the list of arrears comprises a large number of relatively small items, of which the largest represents Clare Slob. Railways show arrears of £123,000, and each individual case is now annually examined by the Treasury and the Board of Works.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : I took exception to a like course being adopted on the Navy
 1680
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : What I stated was that the land itself was unsuitable, but that a great proprietor of the district was ready to exchange for it land which was extremely suitable.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I said that Lord Salisbury had first propounded the idea of selling glebe lands for the purpose of making labourers' holdings.
*(5.20.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : I shall not occupy the attention of the House at any great length, as the question I have to submit lies in a nutshell, and after the Debate on the Small Holdings Bill and the speech of the President of the Board of Agriculture (Mr. Chaplin) I am quite sure he will approach the subject with which I have to deal in a friendly and sympathetic spirit. One of the main objects of the Sale of Glebes Act was to promote the acquisition of plots of land by cottagers and labourers in rural districts. In 1888 a measure was introduced into the House of Lords to enable the sale of glebes, and when the Bill came down to that House it slipped through its various stages without observation till it reached the Third Reading. At that stage it came under my notice, and I moved to recommit the Bill for the purpose of adding two clauses. One aimed at greater publicity, requiring that before the sale of a glebe there should be public inquiry in the parish, so that the villagers and labourers might become purchasers; the other to enable a portion of the purchase money to be left on mortgage, repayable by instalments. The Secretary for War (Mr. E. Stanhope), who had charge of the Bill, objected to my proposal, and it was rejected. I then moved the rejection of the Bill, stating that in my belief no sales would ever take place to labouring people under the measure as it stood, and that it would be futile and useless for the object it had in view. The Secretary of State for War replied that—
 "The Government desired these glebes should he sold in small plots, and he had no hesitation in saying that he believed the measure, in many parts of the country, would not only enable them to be sold in small plots, bat would lead to their being acquired by labourers." 1692 1693 "I see by the papers that you intend to speak in Parliament about the sale of glebes. In this parish all the land and houses in the village belong to our squire. Many of the village tradesmen and labourers would like to be independent and to be owners of small plots of land to cultivate or build on, and some have money to do so and others if helped by loans. But when the glebe here was to he sold it was put about that the squire meant to buy at any price, and we thought it useless to compete with him or to offer for the land. We think a preference should be given to people in our position in such a case, at a fair market value." 1694
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I am afraid that what I have said with regard to the sale of the land has been misunderstood. I did not intend to intimate that the land should be sold for less than its true value. In fact, I maintained that the land ought to be sold at its full value, and that the proper way of carrying it out would be to ascertain, in the first place, what the full value was, and then to offer it to the agricultural labourers of the district at that value. Unless this is done, and the land then

 MR. HALLET STEWART : I am much obliged to you, Mr. Speaker, for the correction, but although I may not have made myself clear, I was merely suggesting that there is within the four corners of the Act sufficient power for the Commissioners to lend to the Sanitary Authority, and that they might be forgiven for doing so, inasmuch as it may have been the intention of the Act that this should be done.
(6.35.)  MR. HALLET STEWART  (Lincolnshire, Spalding) : Before the right hon. Gentleman rises to answer the question put by my hon. Friend, I wish to raise this point as to the administration of the Act. Assuming the answer to my hon. Friend's question to be in the affirmative, would it not be practicable to combine with the Act the suggestions that have been made from this Bench as to the Sanitary Authority being enabled to undertake payments by instalments for the land which is purchased for agricultural and labourers' allotments. Although it might be impossible for incumbents to sell their land to Tom, Dick, or Harry, and run the risk of his credit, it would be a totally different thing if, instead of substituting
 1706
*(6.38.)  MR. CHAPLIN : I can only speak again by the indulgence of the House. But perhaps I may be allowed to reply to the questions addressed to the Government. I speak from memory, but I believe I am right in saying that in every case where a glebe has been sold it has been invariably offered, either in small parcels, or to the Local Authority, for the purpose of allotments in the first instance. I may also add that there have been several cases in which invitations have been sent to the Sanitary Authority, but in which there has not only been no response to the invitation, but where the answer sent back has been that they preferred to have nothing to do with it.
 *MR. CHAPLIN : Yes; but the Prime Minister took occasion at the same time to offer a word of warning as to whether on economic grounds it was likely that any great quantity of land would in the long run pass into the hands of the agricultural labourers, and he expressed great doubt upon that point. The fact is, that if people do not want or are unable to buy land, no legislation which can be passed will compel them to buy it. The proposals of hon. Gentlemen opposite are to the effect that money should be left to be paid by instalments. Why? Because it is for a great public object. Very good; then the burden should be borne by the public, not by the State; and it should not fall on the unfortunate incumbent, who may possibly need his money for other purposes.
 *MR. CHAPLIN : I never supposed that the hon. Member intended to go as far as that, but the Act provides certain methods in which the purchase-money may be invested; and the hon. Member suggests that, instead of the money being invested in the manner prescribed by the Act, it should be invested and left to be paid by instalments, on a security which the incumbent may not consider to be a good one, and which is not provided for in the Act. What is the kind of security offered to the incumbent? When allotments and small holdings were provided at first, they were exceedingly popular; but that is not always the case. I was talking only yesterday to a great proprietor in the Midlands, not a member of the Tory Party, but a man of advanced and even of extreme opinions, belonging to the Party who sit on that side of the House; and he told me of a case where many small holdings and allotments were made by him a few years ago, in order to satisfy a demand then current in this neighbourhood. This demand has fallen off since then, and the small holdings have been given up and thrown on his hands. That might be the experience of the incumbents, who might eventually be saddled with various half-acres of land as a security, which might turn out to be of very little value. The right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) proposes that the Act should be suspended until greater facilities have been provided for the acquisition of land by agricultural labourers. I should be glad to consider any plan for promoting such facilities, although I cannot say that I have received much information, or derived much encouragement from anything that has fallen upon that point from hon. Gentlemen opposite to-night; but I do not think that the absence of these facilities offers any justification for the proposal to suspend the operation of the Act for the future. In its main object the Act has certainly not been unsuccessful. The right hon. Gentleman was correct in saying that there were 600,000 acres of glebe land in this country which could be sold under
 1704
 *MR. CHAPLIN : I believe that is quite accurate. The landed proprietor referred to was perfectly willing to give facilities, and the Board of Agriculture was exceedingly desirous that it should be done, but, owing to unfortunate disputes in the parish between some of the residents, the only thing that could be done was to put the land up to auction at the best price that could be got, and unfortunately none was obtained for allotments. The right hon. Gentleman is of opinion that the Board of Agriculture should give a preferential right to labourers. [Mr. SHAW LEFEVRE: At fair market value.] Then I fail to see how you are to give a preferential right. If we had adopted this course there would have been good ground for complaining of the administration of the Act, because it is expressly provided in the Act that before the land is offered in small parcels, or to the Local Authority for the purpose of small holdings, the Board of Agriculture is to be satisfied that the price of the land will not be diminished thereby. How, then, would it be possible, in accordance with the terms of the Act, to give a preferential right to agricultural labourers or any other class? To do so would be acting in opposition to the terms of the Act, and had I adopted the course which he suggests to me, then, indeed, the Board would have been deserving of the censure which he passes upon it. I should like to put before the House what are the precise facts with which we have to deal. Since the Act came into force in 1888 glebe land belonging to 64 different benefices in 24 English and in three Welsh counties have been sold in 108 different lots, making an average of 12½ acres. The sum realised by these sales was £81,845, averaging £60 per acre, and affording an increase in the income of the 64 benefices of something like 60 per cent. Let me remind the House that the first object of the promoters of the Act was to benefit incumbents. The view of the promoters was that, in consequence

*(6.30.)  MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I have only risen to raise a point on which I shall be glad if the President of the Local Government Board would say a word or two. I cannot quite agree with the arguments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bradford (Mr. Shaw Lefevre). No doubt this Act was passed in order to benefit the incumbents, and I understand that it has done so, because the incumbents were formerly exposed to great trouble and anxiety, and occasionally had to suffer a good deal of poverty in consequence of the great uncertainty which existed as to the amounts they were to receive, and the small amounts they did obtain at times as compared with what they had anticipated. Since the Act has been passed an Incumbent, when he sells his glebe, is not subject to the uncertainty which formerly attached to the annual value of the agricultural land. He gets a certain income, and he knows whether it is large or small, and what arrangements he can make. I agree that it is the duty of the Commissioners under the Act to get the utmost value they can for the property, and I should be very sorry if the labourers, simply because they happen to be poor, were to be allowed to buy land at a less price than other people. I do not agree with the suggestion as to leaving a portion of the purchase-money on mortgage. I do not think that that is desirable in the case of the labouring men, and further I think it clear, as pointed out by the Minister for Agriculture, that if the money were allowed to remain on mortgage, either wholly or in part, one of the main objects of the Act would be defeated. If the money was left on mortgage, one of the requirements of the Act that the Commissioners should invest it at the request of the incumbent in buying

 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S. E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether the Boy Messengers' and the District Messengers' Companies could be allowed to carry out and to reap the benefit of the system which their labour and capital inaugurated, and if he will, with that view, grant them licences to work the electric call system upon payment of a royalty to the Post Office; and' whether, if it should be legally necessary, he will introduce a short Bill to authorise charging a royalty?
 MR. COBB : Will the right hon. Gentleman be willing to grant some ready way of deciding the legal point involved—as to the right of these companies to deliver letters? Further, when the point is decided, will the right hon. Gentleman be willing to grant licences to the Messenger Companies for the use of the electric call system?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Homo Department whether, without giving a Return, he can state the number of persons now in prison in England and Wales for contempt of Court, the periods for which they have been in prison, and the places and dates of their committal?
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : I understood my right hon. Friend to say that, and I understood the right hon. Gentleman to bow assent. I would appeal to the right hon. Gentleman in the interests of promoting the business of the House. Nobody wishes to obstruct the appointment of this Committee, but the Scotch Members have a right to have their say with reference to the constitution of the Committee, as far as the Scotch element is concerned. To-night there are several questions of paramount importance on the Paper; the Committee, if appointed, cannot sit before Easter, and therefore, as there has clearly been a misunderstanding, and as both the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Stirling Burghs and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for, Berwick, have left London believing that this matter would not come on, I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to assent to the question being postponed.
(7.41.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : As I am one of those Commissioners of whom the hon. Member for Northampton has so low an opinion, I may say that the Commission devoted a considerable amount of time to the organisation and work of the Foreign Office. We received answers to something like 4,000 questions as to the work and organisation of the Foreign Office, and not one of the points raised to-night failed to receive fair consideration and examination. I wish to ask the Under Secretary a question, and so emphasise the appeal made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen—whether the Foreign Office intend, in the shape of a Minute or Memorandum, to take any course with regard to the recommendations of the Commission? We made 54 separate recommendations, and I think it is due to a body of gentlemen who devoted a large amount of time and attention to a careful examination of these public questions that some official notice should be taken of their recommendations. I think the Commission on Civil Establishments have some reason to complain of the mode in which their recommendations have been treated by the Government as a whole. With reference, to the Foreign Office, the Commission was very careful to recognise the exceptional peculiarities of the administration. The Commission entirely dissented from many of the views expressed by the hon. Member for Northampton, and I do not think there is in any one of our recommendations any point on which the traditions of the Foreign Office are not duly and sufficiently recognised. I can quite understand the right hon. Gentleman being in considerable difficulty in making a speech on this subject. A speech will have to be carried to a great length, and there will be some difficulty in discussing the various points with the Speaker in the Chair. I would suggest that, before the Foreign Office Estimates are discussed, some official Memorandum should be placed before the House of what view the Secretary of State takes generally of the recommendations of the Commission.
 MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : When the right hon. Gentleman stated on Thursday that if the Motion was not taken on Friday it would not be taken till after Easter, did not the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Stirling Burghs make arrangements to leave England on Saturday, so that when it was decided to bring that on today it was too late for him to alter them?
(5.5.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I am sure that everybody will agree that the right hon. Gentleman is most scrupulously honourable in recognising understandings in carrying on the business of the House, but I

 MR. HOBHOUSE  (Somerset, E.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he will explain why, although the parcel was properly insured, all compensation has been refused for the loss of a sum of £8 17s. 7d., which was stolen,  in transitu
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : And I will ask whether, in case the Speaker is got out of the Chair to-night, it is intended to take effective Supply?
(5.13.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I intend to vote for the proposal of the hon. Member for Dundee, though I disagree with every word that-has fallen from him and from every Scotch Member who has spoken. What with Scotch Members, Irish Members, and Welsh Members the unfortunate English Member never has an opportunity of expressing his views in this House, or of getting any sort of English legislation. Hon. Gentlemen from Scotland tell us that only 20 of their number are here. Where are the others? The answer is "Oh! they did not know that Scotch business was to be brought on."' Well, let me tell hon. Members from Scotland that their duty when they are elected to this House is not only to come-here when the Scotch business is on. The duty of every Member on this side of the House, no matter where he comes-from, is to help Ministers to carry on good legislation, and to do their best to hinder them from carrying on bad legislation. We always have this sort of appeal from Scotch and Irish Members when the holidays are coming on—

(7.22.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I think that the suggested fusion between the Diplomatic Service and the Foreign Office would entail far greater changes than the hon. Gentleman appears to contemplate. The fact is, that many men enter the Foreign Office who have no private means, for they can in London live on their salaries, whereas it is quite impossible for attachés abroad to do so. They are not

 MR. LABOUCHERE : No doubt certain retrenchments might be made, bat I believe that if the Commissioners had taken the trouble to make out an estimate they would have found the increased expenditure would nearly, if not quite, outweigh the saving. There certainly is great opportunity for reduction. Our Ambassadors at St. Petersburg and Rome are overpaid, being paid more than those of any other country. It is said they have to dispense a great amount of hospitality. I have been in the Diplomatic Service, and I never saw this reckless hospitality. The real expense is incurred in keeping up a position equal in style to that of the inhabitants of the country. But I would do away entirely with Ambassadors. All that is required
 1714
 MR. LABOUCHERE : When any sensible suggestion is made one generally hears it is rejected. Why was it rejected? Because, no doubt, the Consular Service is a happy home for the friends of gentlemen in power. There is an examination, but it means nothing. In France there is a different system. There is a fusion between the Diplomatic Service and the Consular Service. The French do not take gentlemen who are broken down in business and in health, but they start men in the Consular Service, just as they start them in the Diplomatic Service. Gentlemen start as Consular cadets, and these are to the Consuls what attachés are to the Minister. They rise to be Vice Consuls and afterwards to be Consuls, and if I remember right there are three different grades of Consuls. It frequently happens that instead of going on in the Consular Service a man will pass into the Diplomatic Service; whilst many gentlemen who are in the French Diplomatic Service, when they

 MR. MATTHEWS : I observe that the evidence in these cases shows that children are obtained by means of advertisement. I do not see my way to legislative interference with these advertisements, which do not invite to anything necessarily illegal. Neither the Infant Life Act of 1872, nor the amending Bill of last year, which was considered by a Select Committee of this House, proposed to control or prevent the insertion of such advertisements, which are, moreover, found by the police to be a useful clue to the whereabouts of the baby-farming establishments.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have nothing to add to the answer which I have already given, and to which I beg to refer the hon. Member.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The Inspectors whom I called upon to furnish this Return do not in all cases state the sources of their information; but it appears to have been gathered for the most part from notes and documents in their possession, and in part from inquiries made at the collieries.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have asked the Prison Commissioners to furnish me with this information, which I will in due course communicate to the hon. Member. I do not, however, propose to include in the Return persons who have
 1660
 MR. MATTHEWS : I do not think that the re-production of the newspaper reports as a Parliamentary Return would be advisable, as they would not necessarily have the authority and accuracy which in such a case would be essential. These Judgments will in due course appear in the most authoritative form in publications devoted to reporting the decisions of the Courts of Law. Such publications are well known and perfectly accessible to all Magistrates' Clerks and Clerks of the Peace.
 MR. MATTHEWS  did not reply.
 MR. MATTHEWS : My attention has been drawn to these complaints, and I have made inquiry. The Inspector reports that the existing arrangements work satisfactorily; but I am not satisfied that in some cases the requirements of the law as to personal supervision are fully observed; and I have it under consideration what further proceedings it may be desirable to take.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am afraid I am not sufficiently acquainted with both Judgments to be able to answer that question.
 *MR. MATTHEWS : The Memorandum containing the data and facts upon which the provisions of the Inflammable Liquids Bill have been founded has been some days in the hands of the printers, and I hope that it will be circulated to hon. Members in the course of the Recess. The notices, however, of opposition to this Bill are so numerous as to render its chances of passing this year very remote. I propose, therefore, as soon as the Memorandum is before the House, to move that a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the whole subject, and to await their Report before asking the House to legislate.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I am informed by the Clerk to the Justices that on the 7th March the Magistrates refused the application of Mr. Dix, because in their opinion, which had been twice expressed in previous cases and acquiesced in by the tenants, the point of law which Mr. Dix raised, namely, that a new tenancy had been created in the miners by holding over, and that there was no lawful right to possession in the landlord, was not well founded. On the 14th March the application of Mr. Dix was renewed as to another batch of warrants, and counsel for the landlord on this occasion joined in the application in order to get the legal question definitely settled. For this reason, and not because Mr. Dix on the 14th March intimated his intention of applying for a mandamus, the Magistrates agreed to accept sureties. The amount of the sureties was settled between Mr. Dix and the counsel for the landlord at £100 for the value of the premises and £50 for the probable costs of the action in each case. There were 173 cases included in the application of the 7th March. Ultimately bonds were completed in two cases only, the sureties in those cases refusing to execute any further bond, no other sureties being offered. The Magistrates made various offers to facilitate the finding of sureties by the defendants; and ultimately made an offer, with the landlord's consent, to reduce the amount in all cases, but the two above mentioned to the nominal sum of £5; but this offer was refused. The Magistrates held that under Section 3 of the Statute they were bound to require separate bonds in each case; that they had no power to delay the remedy under one warrant because security had been given with respect to another; and that they had not power to consolidate the cases, as the Superior Court might and probably would do. I have no authority to interpret the Statute, and must decline to express an opinion on the subject.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I received last year a representation from a Coroner's Jury that some restriction should be

 *MR. RAIKES : It is my intention to have the legal point decided almost immediately. An information will be
 1657
 *MR. RAIKES : There is no illegality in the employment of commissionaires for the delivery of letters. We are advised that it is equivalent to the employment of any ordinary messenger for a particular message. It is not a system for the collection and delivery of letters to the profit of a company which, by that profit, trenches upon the revenue. There is no profit to any company in the employment of commissionaires.
 *MR. RAIKES : It is my first duty to vindicate the rights of the State in the Courts of Law if necessary. After this has been done, I am quite willing to consider any suggestions that may be made in the interest of public convenience, so far as they can be reconciled with the law. If the hon. Member has read the correspondence which has passed between the Post Office and the companies, he must be aware that the system inaugurated by these undertakings has-been commenced and carried on in the* face of repeated warnings of its illegality.
 *MR. RAIKES : Of course I cannot suppose that the hon. Member's question is serious; but I have no reason to believe that the action to which he refers is in any way illegal.
 *MR. RAIKES : I give the figures asked for by the hon. Member as they appear in the printed Estimates and Appropriation Accounts. The actual expenditure in the Post Office Savings Bank for all purposes in 1887–8 was less than the amount estimated
 1658
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : I have been informed that certain firms send their price-lists and circulars to the Continent to be posted; but the transfer of this unremunerative business to foreign post offices is not financially disadvantageous to the British Post Office, though a slight advantage may be gained by the senders of the circulars. I have for some time been considering the question of postage rates as they affect the book post, which have formed part of the subject recently inquired into by a Departmental Committee. But I cannot' at present say whether any reduction can be made in this particular case.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to state that the second class postmen at Nottingham, to whom I presume the question refers, are on a scale of wages rising from 18s. by 1s. a week to 21s. a week. On promotion to the first-class they would receive wages of 22s., rising to 26s. a week. The rate of wages for postmen employed in London has always been higher than that for postmen in provincial towns.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member I have to state that, in view of the strong disfavour with which extensions of Post Office labour on Sunday are regarded by a large section of the public, as well as of the decision of the Select Committee on this particular question, I have not seen my way to impose additional work upon the Post Office servants in order to make a general collection of letters in London on Sunday evening.
 *MR. RAIKES : I think I must ask for notice of that question.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to state that compensation has been refused on the ground that the parcel contained money—money being expressly excluded from insurance under the Regulations of the Parcel Post. The parcel when insured was not known by the Post Office servant who received it to contain money. If this had been made known by the sender, the insurance fee would not have been accepted. The thief, I regret to state, has not been discovered. I understand that the money was collected for the purpose named. I regret that it is out of my power to direct that compensation should be paid.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am advised that under the Act of 1870 it is for the Postmaster General to decide when a publication contains a sufficient proportion of
 "Political or other news, or of articles relating thereto, or to other current topics," "News or to articles relating thereto, or to other current topics," 1663
 MR. RAIKES : Without pledging myself as to the decision which may be come to on this subject, I may say that the question raised is already under consideration.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am not aware that the Corps of the Commissionaires receives and takes in letters at its office in the Strand in the mode stated by the hon. Member. The Corps of the Commissionaires has no resemblance in organisation or objects to a company organised for profit, such as that of the Boy Messengers.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to state that while a scheme is under consideration for giving a later despatch of the day mail from Hacketstown and Kiltegan, which would involve working the mail car from Baltinglass instead of from Tinahely, I have not as yet full information before me, and I have come to no decision on the subject. I have certainly no desire to make any change which would not be acceptable to the residents generally; and I will take care that their views shall not be lost sight of when the matter comes before me for final decision.
 *MR. RAIKES : The telegrams coming in to an office at Kiltimagh from other places would represent revenue proper
 1673
*(11.52.)  THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : The lateness of the hour must prevent me from giving a detailed answer to the objections which the hon. Gentleman has taken to my conduct in this matter; and as I hope in a short time to obtain the decision of a Court of Law upon the main issues, it would be premature to discuss this evening what course I may be advised to take after that decision has been obtained. The hon. Member has very seriously misapprehended the action of the Department. The main question is one, not only between the Government and the District Messenger Company, but, in a much greater degree, between the Government and the Boy Messenger Company, which is simply an Express Service by means of boy messengers. The new service, of which the particulars appear on the Paper to-day, will be a far more efficient service. I would merely point out that the number of the stations will be at least double that of the Boy Messenger Company, and the number of boys employed ten times as numerous; the charge will be less, and, in fact, the new system will have every advantage which one system can have over another. I will only say that I should be very glad indeed if I could believe that I had no

 MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W. R., Holmfirth) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department
 1669
 MR. H. S. WRIGHT  (Nottingham, S.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he will explain why a number of letter carriers at Nottingham, who have been on the permanent staff about five years, are only receiving 21s. weekly, whilst others, who commenced their service at the General Post Office on the same date, are receiving 25s. or 26s. a week?
 MR. H. T. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN  (Kent, Faversham) : May I ask when the Memorandum explaining the Government proposals for increasing the pay of workmen in our dockyards will be issued?
 MR. WATT  (Glasgow, Camlachie) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the Colony of British Guiana has been in negotiation with the United States of America, and also with the Dominion of Canada, with

 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he did not state on Thursday that the Private Bill Procedure Committee would be nominated on Friday, and whether it is not within his knowledge that a large number of Scotch Members, relying on that statement, arranged to leave town on Saturday morning?
 MR. BRYCE : The proposal was made and rejected.
 MR. BRYCE : Mr. Marvin was not a Lower Division clerk, but a person brought in from outside.
 MR. BRYCE : I realise that the change will involve some extra expense, but I suggest it may be met by retrenchments in other matters.
(6.41.)  MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I desire to take this opportunity, which may not recur for a long time, to call attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, so far as it affects the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service, although I shall, of course, be unable to move the Resolution which I put upon the Paper—
 "That, in the opinion of this House, effect ought to be given to the recommendations of the Royal Commission relating to improve-men's in the organisation of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service." 1708 1709 1710 1711 1712
(9.54.)  MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I desire to call the attention of the House to the Report of the West Highland Commissioners, although I shall not be in order in moving as I had intended—
 "That, in the opinion of this House, the Government ought to proceed without delay to carry out the schemes recommended for the devolopment of the material resources of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland." 1735 1736
 MR. CALDWELL : The count that has just taken place has had this good effect: that it has brought in the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, both of whom have undertaken to consider the question of the grants to the Highlands. I hope they will take the opportunity of declaring the policy of the Government. Some remarks were made on the Report of the Commission by the late Lord Advocate, which would probably tend to cast a reflection on the men of the West Coast. It was pointed out that men on the East Coast can come round to the West and fish, while the boats of the West Coast fishermen are lying on the shore. But in the case of the East Coast fishermen, the boats are necessarily large. The men live in localities intersected by railways, and in which there is a large population, and the result is that the East Coast fisherman is a man of more wealth, and necessarily has a larger boat, which can come round to the West Coast. The West Coast fishermen are very poor, and it is impossible for them to own large boats. There is also a lack of harbours such as exist on the East Coast, and what is wanted is better harbour facilities and a ready communication with the markets of the South. Three lines of railway are recommended by the Commissioners. The first is a line to Mallaig, and the Commissioners recommend that a sum of 2½ per cent. should be guaranteed for four years on an estimated cost of £285,000. It is impossible that any Railway Company would construct a railway on any such terms. I think in such a case, considering what is being done in the congested districts of Ireland, the Government should bear a third of the cost. The Commissioners also recommend the construction of a harbour at Mallaig at a cost of £15,000. The second line proposed is to Kyleakin. If a line were made to Mallaig we would have the North British competing with the Highland Railway, who would be compelled to bring their line from Strome Ferry to Kyleakin, and also to Ullapool, if they wished to secure any of the Lewis or Skye traffic. The proposals of the Commissioners for the improvement of harbour accommodation in the Lewis amount to about £53,000

 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : Was there not an hour and a half available on Friday when the Motion might have been taken?
 DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if his attention has been called to the reported illness of Mr. John Dillon, M.P.; and if he can give any information with regard to Mr. Dillon's health?
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been called to an abortive sale by auction, on behalf of the Irish Land Purchase Commissioners, at Marsh's Auction Mart, in the City of Cork, on the 3rd instant, when the farm of Daniel Kelly was put up for sale, he having failed to pay the instalments to the Commissioners; but no bidders appearing, the sale was abandoned; whether he will inquire at what terms as to valuation and number of years' purchase Daniel Kelly purchased the farm, and whether he purchased under threat of eviction by the landlord, Mr. James H. Payne, of West Cork; and whether, in his new Land Bills, he will take measures
 1672
 MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that great distress prevails in the parishes of Kiltimagh and Kilkelly, in the County of Mayo; whether it is his intention to mitigate the distress in these parishes by means of the relief works proposed to be started at Black-loon and Kilbeagh in the same county; whether he is aware that the latter places are a long distance from the former two places; whether he can say how many hundreds of names the police-have given as needing relief in Kilkelly and Kilmovee, and how many have been relieved in these places; and whether, considering the numbers in need of relief in Kilkelly and Kilmovee, he will consider
 1671
 SIR J. COLOMB : Does the noble Lord mean to say we hold the land subject to the consent of the Colonial Government?
 SIR J. COLOMB : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether Sydney is the recognised headquarters-and base of the British Fleet maintained in the South Pacific for the protection of the maritime interests and sea commerce of the Empire; whether the contemplated surrender of the Admiralty establishment at Circular Quay, Sydney, to the Colonial Government (as referred to in the statement explanatory of the Navy Estimates) includes the surrender of the land; whether this land belongs to, and is under the control of, the Imperial Government; and whether the land to which it is proposed to remove the Admiralty establishment at Sydney belongs to the Imperial Government or to the Colonial Government; and, if to the latter, will the Admiralty reserve the right to use this new naval establishment for Imperial purposes for a fixed period or only during the pleasure of the Colonial Government?
 SIR J. COLOMB : Will the noble Lord lay the Papers on the Table?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : Will the Motion for the Adjournment be made at the commencement of the Sitting to-morrow?
 SIR J. POPE HENNESSY  (Kilkenny, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government have received any remonstrance from the Government of China respecting the recent annexation of a port of Burma, which part of Burma was tributary to the Empire of China?
 MR. KELLY : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he is aware of the occurrences which took place at the Charing Cross Railway Station upon the occasion of the departure, on Tuesday last, of the right honourable the Member for Mid Lothian (Mr. Gladstone) for Hastings, when the crowd broke down the frail barriers which had been erected, and two persons were thrown down between the saloon carriages forming part of the moving train, and narrowly escaped being crushed to death; and that again, on the same day, at the Tunbridge Wells Station, another crowd broke down the barriers, and gathered round the train there; and whether the Board of Trade have any power to prohibit the use of railway stations for political demonstrations; and, if so, if he is able to give the House an assurance that it will in future be exercised?
 MR. KELLY : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will inform the House when the Memorandum containing the data and facts, upon which the provisions of the Inflammable Liquids Bill have been founded, is to be laid upon the Table of the House; and whether, if this cannot

 MR. KELLY : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether the actual expenditure in the Post Office Savings Bank exceeded the Estimate in each of the years 1887–8, 1888–9, and 1889–90; whether he will state the amounts of the Estimates, of the total Votes, and of the actual expenditure for overtime in the Post Office Savings Bank in each of these three years; and whether the actual expenditure for overtime for the current financial year up to 14th March exceeds the Estimate for the year 1890–91; and, if so, by what amount?
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, in view of the fact that many of the recommendations for the promotion of Second Division clerks at the Admiralty have, although involving no change in the organisation of the office, been under consideration now for a period of nine months, he can say when there is any likelihood of effect being given to these recommendations?
 MR. COURTNEY  (Cornwall, Bodmin) : The new Standing Orders, and an Amendment to Standing Orders 21 and 23, which stand on the Paper in the name of the President of the Local Government Board relative to Procedure in case of Bills promoted by the London County Council, will be proposed on Monday, April 6.

 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The Board of Trade have, on appeal, sanctioned the establishment of a light and fog signal on Rattray Head; but the order in which this and other new lighthouse works sanctioned in Scotland should be carried out has not yet been determined, and I think there are more pressing works than this.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD or TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol. W. : Yes, Sir. The facts stated by the hon. Baronet are substantially correct; but I am now in communication with the Trinity House with regard to the removal of the wreck referred to.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Evidence to the effect stated in the question was given to the Trade and Treaties Committee, and the Committee have reported on the subject; but I do not think it advisable at present to publish their Report.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : No, Sir; I have no official knowledge of the facts referred to, and the Board of Trade have no statutory authority to take any action in the matter. But I agree with my hon. Friend in thinking that it is most undesirable that the safety and convenience of those whose business compels them to use railway platforms should be interfered with by political or other demonstrations. If an accident resulted, those who permit such demonstrations will incur a grave responsibility.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : As stated in my reply to a question by the hon. Member for Sunderland on the 13th of March, 1890, the Board of Trade have appointed a Special Committee consisting of the following gentlemen:—Sir Edward Harland, M.P., Mr. James G. S. Anderson, Professor Philip Jenkins, Mr. A. C. Kirk, Mr. James Laing, and Mr. T. B. Royden, M.P., to consider and Report upon the question of the efficient subdivision of merchant ships by means of watertight bulkheads, and I shall be happy to furnish the hon. Member with a copy of the terms of Reference. All the members of this Committee, with two exceptions, are shipowners. The Committee are still engaged upon their Inquiry, and have no doubt obtained such evidence as they required; but they have received no special authority for this purpose, beyond that implied in their appointment.

*(11.28.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I am in accord with my hon. Friend in desiring to promote, if we can, a closer union and greater commercial intercourse with our colonies, but I fear I cannot agree with him as to the means by which he desires to achieve his end, because I think my hon. Friend's proposal would fail to have any satisfactory results. My hon. Friend considers that the promotion of a closer commercial union

 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am now referring to the advantages which we enjoy under the Treaties, an important clause of which the hon. Member asks us to denounce. If we were to denounce one clause, that would necessitate the reconsideration of the other provisions of the Treaties. Before we take this course the hon. Member must induce the House and the country to accept his policy of adopting a Preferential Tariff as between this country and our colonies against Foreign nations. We have not as yet arrived at the point the hon. Member desires, and therefore he is putting the cart before the horse. From his point of view, what is the good of denouncing Treaties, which he admits confer other advantages, before we are prepared to adopt the policy which is prevented by the clause to which he objects? Let him propagate his gospel, and when he has converted the country to his policy, then he may ask the Government to carry it out.
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southward, W.) : I must press the Motion.
 ADMIRAL MAYNE : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, in view of the general dissatisfaction now existing with respect to the police in Her Majesty's ships, he will take steps to improve their position, and so induce petty officers and other seamen of standing and good character to join the Force?
 ADMIRAL MAYNE : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, in view of his statements on the great importance of the Dock at Gibraltar and of the lengthening of the Mole there, and also of the fact that no reference is made to these important works in his statement for this year, he will state what is the practical upshot of the deliberations of the Committee which reported last year on the Dock, and whether any steps are being taken towards its construction; and whether the Mole is going to be lengthened so as to enable it to store more than the ridiculously inadequate amount of coal it can at present?
 ADMIRAL MAYNE  (Pembroke and Haverfordwest) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he will stop the further manufacture of Brennan torpedoes, pending the completion of the experiments with the dynamite gun, which, it is believed by many, does all that the Brennan torpedo can, and probably much more, and is not open to many of the objections to the Brennan? I beg also to ask whether any Admiralty opinion has been obtained as regards the sites selected for the Brennan installations?
(5.10.)  DR. FARQUHARSON  (Aberdeenshire, W.) : Assuming that there has been no breach of faith with the Scotch Members, it would be most unsatisfactory, as a mere matter of business, to enter upon the consideration of a question affecting Scotland so intimately—and a question, which of course, indirectly affects in a like degree England and Ireland—when so large a number of Scotch Members are away. The right hon. Gentleman has said there is a fair number of Scotch Members present, but when I look round I do not see more than 20 of the 70 Scotch Members in their places. I am told that five

 MR. MONTAGU : Can it not be possible in future to bring the balance nearer?
 MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been drawn to the large consumption of chlorodyne, especially among women, and the grave evils which result from this practice; whether the fact of chlorodyne being a patent medicine and protected by a stamp exempts it from the operation of the Sale of Poisons Act; and whether the Government will take into consideration the expediency of classing chlorodyne with other narcotics, and only allow it to be sold under the same restrictions?
 MR. STOREY  (Sunderland) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that, on Saturday, 6th March, the County Magistrates at Sunderland refused the application by Mr. Dix, on behalf of the miners of Silks worth, to enter into a bond with two sureties to try the point of law in the Superior Court, and also refused to delay the execution of the warrants of eviction; and whether, having regard to the provisions of 1 & 2 Vic, c. 74, s. 3, the Magistrates, if satisfied of the sufficiency of such sureties, had "any legal power to refuse the said application; whether he is aware that, on Saturday, 13th March, after notice of mandamus, the said County Magistrates agreed to bind the said miners, but required a bond of £6150 in each case, or, there being in all nearly 500 cases, a total security for costs of £75,000 sterling; whether, the point of law in all these cases being one and the same, the practice of the Superior Court is, under such circumstances, to consolidate the actions into one; whether Clause 3 of the Act requires the Magistrates to approve two sureties
 "in such sum as to them shall seem reasonable, regard being had to the value of the premises and the probable costs of an action; "

STANLEY LEIGHTON : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether his attention has been called to the indebtedness of Local Authorities in England and Wales which, by the last Return, amounts to £195,442,397; and to the fact that the local debt is now 42·7 per cent. higher than it was in 1880, while during the same period the rateable value of the whole country, excluding the Metropolis,

*(5.48.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I think we are indebted to the right hon. Gentleman for bringing this matter forward. There is no doubt that the Glebe Lands Act of 1888 was primarily a measure of relief for the clergy. That was the intention and object of the Act. Clergymen had glebe

 MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade, in view of the fact that the Commissioners of Northern Lights have recently urged strongly the erection of a lighthouse and fog-signal station on Rattray Head, as a necessity for the safe navigation of the adjoining coast, but that this request was refused by the Trinity House, and also, on appeal, by the Board of Trade, on the grounds of the insufficient amount of funds allotted to the Commissioners out of the Mercantile Marine Fund, whether he will take steps to secure that an adequate sum is allotted to the Commissioners of Northern Lights, to enable them to render navigation safe along the coasts for the lighting of which they are responsible?
 MR. LEGH : I confess I do not see much difference. Mr. Marvin was introduced, and the results were particularly unfortunate. Under the circum

(7.35.)  MR. LEGH  (Lancashire, S.W., Newton) : As a former member of the Diplomatic Service, there is one portion of the speech of the hon. Member for Aberdeen (Mr. Bryce) with which I most thoroughly agree, namely, that portion in which he expressed the hope that the Diplomatic Service would in future be protected from the interference of outsiders. The practice of introducing outsiders has almost attained to the proportions of a scandal. The hon. Member for Northampton remarked that the Consular Service has become a sort of refuge for the friends of persons in power, and that the Diplomatic Service has literally been turned into the home of rest for decayed or distressed politicians, and in that I agree with him. But I feel bound to add that is the only friendly sentiment the hon. Member expressed towards the Diplomatic Service. I may possibly be somewhat prejudiced on this question, but I maintain there is no great difference, on the whole, between those in the Diplomatic Service and the clerks in the Foreign Office. If I mistake not, the hon. Member for Northampton was once in the Diplomatic Service. When he entared it probably the examination was not one of a very severe character, and yet I presume there would be few people who would be disposed to express the opinion that the hon. Member is not equal to the average Foreign Office clerk in ability or in anything else. Now, the most important change which is advocated by the Commission is the fusion between the Consular and Diplomatic Services. Anyone who has had experience of either of the Services must have come to the conclusion that that fusion is eminently desirable. Even the Foreign Office clerks, who are so superior

 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware whether the decision given by the House of Lords overrules that given in the City of Dublin (Queen's Bench) to the contrary effect?
(5.16.)  MR. W. E. GLADSTONE  (Edinburgh, Mid Lothian) : I entirely acquit the right hon. Gentleman of any departure from an understanding, but it is evident that there has been a belief in such an understanding, and important Members who are deeply interested in the question have left London in that opinion. But, still it remains a contested matter, while the good faith of the right hon. Gentleman has not been brought in question at all. He has been appealed to on the ground of an understanding, of courtesy, and of favour. I will appeal to the right hon. Gentleman on less lofty grounds, namely, those of interest in connection with the progress of the business of the House. I submit that the great interest of the Government, as the representative of the public in this matter, is to get the Speaker out of the Chair to-night for the consideration of the Civil Service
 1690
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE : Will the First Lord of the Treasury be good enough to say what Bills will be advanced before the Motion for Adjournment?
 MR. W. E. GLADSTONE  (Edinburgh, Mid Lothian) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury, with respect to the request of the two Houses of the Legislature of Newfoundland conveyed by telegram on the 20th instant, if Her Majesty's Government are now able to make known to the House their reply to that request?
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : In answer to the questions of the right hon. Gentleman opposite and of my hon. and learned Friend behind me, I have to state that the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed on Saturday to the Governor of Newfoundland, requesting him to inform the President of the Legislative Council and the Speaker of the House of Assembly that the Bill to give effect to the  modus vivendi
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I can only refer the hon. Member to the answer given by the Secretary of State for War, on the 28th November last, to an almost precisely similar question. To that answer I have nothing to add.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The Mail Ships Bill, the Electoral Disabilities Removal Bill, and one or two others.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Class I. of the Civil Service Estimates.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : No.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I did not gather that.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : In my letter I distinctly stated that we could not entertain the proposal to abandon the Bill, and that so grave a change with regard to procedure as the substitution of a Commission for Select Committees in dealing with Private Bills could not be made unless by Statute. We are of opinion that procedure by Standing Order is not desirable in so grave a matter, and that the judgment of both Houses of Parliament should be taken with regard to the proposal. It is obviously a proposal which cannot be confined to Scotland, but must be extended to other parts of the United Kingdom if the measure is successful, and it is impossible that it can be made by Standing Order. There is nothing which would pain me more than to have it supposed that I was capable of a breach of understanding in this House; but I cannot be responsible for the interpretation hon. Members may put upon my plain words, which is not consistent with those words. I would remind the House that I stated on Friday, before the adjournment, that I did propose to proceed with this matter to-day and at this hour, and therefore the House is not taken by surprise. Hon. Members from Scotland are not taken by surprise, and therefore I should be breaking down the practice under which we have conducted business hitherto, if I were to yield to the Motion for adjournment.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I said I hoped so.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Yes, Sir; we have reason to believe it will be before us to-morrow.
*(4.58.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : The hon. and learned Gentleman said he moved the adjournment first, because there has been a breach of an understanding, and next because there is a change of front. I do not think it possible for anyone in my position to be more distinct and clear than I was in what I said on Thursday, for I then said that if it was not taken on Friday it would be taken on Monday. I was careful to say that if it were not taken before the Easter Recess it would not be taken till the Thursday after the House re-assembled. Surely my remarks were of the nature of a distinct notice that the Government desired to take the Motion before the Easter Recess, not on the last day, but on a day like this, when the attendance is usually very full. With regard to the question of change of front, there was no change of front on the part of the Government, who are willing to act on the suggestions contained in the letter which I wrote to the right hon. Gentleman the

 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I do not wish to impute anything to the hon. Gentlemen who differ from me in my views, but I had reason to believe that the opportunity would be taken to talk out the discussion on that night.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I should be exceedingly sorry if the right hon. Gentleman misunderstood me. Bat if reference was made to the record it will be seen that my statement was that if the Motion for the Committee was not taken before Easter it would not be taken till the Thursday after. Moreover, no suggestion was made to me of an objection being raised at a sitting like this, which is a day before the adjournment.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope the Motion for the Adjournment will be reached at a Morning Sitting to-morrow. The course will be to move that the House after a Sitting on Wednesday, or perhaps, Thursday—because the Government can hardly tell when the Commission will arrive for the Royal Assent—adjourn until Monday, April 6. It is not intended to proceed with any business at the Sitting on Wednesday or Thursday,
 1682
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The hon. Gentleman is well aware that though I may propose I cannot dispose of the time of the House. I certainly had no expectation that the proceedings on the Welsh Tithe Bill, with regard to one clause, would be protracted as they were. Owing to that fact, it was impossible to take the Motion on Friday.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : No, Sir, it is not intended to do that. There is no rule against moving the Speaker out of the Chair as the second Order of the Day, when it is preceded simply by the question of the nomination of a Committee. I gave notice early in the week that if the Scotch Committee was not appointed before Easter it would not be taken until the Thursday after Easter; and, in answer to a question, I gave notice on Friday that I should propose it to-day, being aware, as the noble Lord has stated, that there is a strong feeling in Scotland in favour of the Committee being appointed. I am only keeping my engagement, therefore, with the House in putting down the Committee for to-day. The Member for Stirling Burghs spoke to me privately on Friday, and I told him, as I told other hon. Gentlemen, that the Government intended to proceed with the Motion on Monday. I should be exceedingly sorry if Scotch Members are not present, but I repeat I have given full notice, and I must adhere to the arrangement.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : It is not usual for the appointment of a Committee to take a very long time, and I hope that in an hour and a half's time we may be able to proceed with the Civil Service Estimates.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : No, not necessarily. It may be necessary to advance one or two Bills before the Motion is made.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : It is not in my power to set aside a day for the consideration of the Eight Hours Bill for miners.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I am afraid that that would be a most unpopular proposal.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I do not think the hon. Gentleman is entitled to say I did that; I only expressed a desire that

 *MR. W. SMITH : The proposals made by the delegates here from Newfoundland were submitted to the French Government, but were declined. The French Government have declared themselves unable to negotiate for the surrender of any of their rights until the extent of those rights has been authoritatively settled.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I have already said that the Bill will not be proceeded with in the House of Lords until the 16th of April. We have information that the delegation from Newfoundland will start immediately, and there will be ample time for any representation which the Legislature of Newfoundland may wish to make to Her Majesty's Government.
*(5.18.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : The right hon. Gentleman urges the Government to make this concession on the ground that it will forward public business. I own that is a very strong ground indeed. The right hon. Member for Wolverhampton says that the Debate ought not to take more than an hour and a half, and that he will do everything in his power to limit the discussion to a reasonable period. Upon the understanding which I think I have obtained from the other side of the House, including hon. Gentlemen from Scotland, that assistance will be given to the Government in bringing the Debate to a speedy termination, I will put the Order down for Thursday, April 9th, as the first Order of the Day. With regard to proceeding with the Land Purchase (Ireland) Bill, it is a serious matter to postpone a measure of that description; but I accept the assurance which has been given, and consent to the adjournment of the Debate.
*(10.58.)  THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I have listened with a great deal of attention to the remarks which have been made by various hon. Members as to the state of Lewis and and the other Islands on the West Coast of Scotland. The Government have taken steps to inform themselves as to the condition of that part of Her Majesty's Dominions. It is not now proposed that they should do anything on the ground of distress, but that, as there is a portion of the country which remains undeveloped, assistance may be given to enable the inhabitants to maintain themselves in a condition of perfect independence. It was with that purpose the Government thought it right to appoint a Commission. The labours of the Commission have been spoken of in a very disparaging manner, but I think if hon. Members will look at the result, it will be found that the Commissioners devoted a large amount of time to their duty, and brought a great deal of

 THE SECRETARY TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. LONG,  Wilts, Devizes : The indebtedness of Local Authorities in England and Wales, inclusive of the Metropolis, was, according to the last Return, as stated, £195,442,000, and this shows an increase of 42·7 per cent. since 1880. During the same period the rateable value of the whole country, excluding the Metropolis, has risen 8·6 per cent., and, including the Metropolis, about 12 per cent. The increase of indebtedness in respect to harbours, piers, and docks amounts to £6,362,400, and it should be borne in mind that the debt in respect of these undertakings, which amounts to about £31,000, is with very few exceptions not a charge on local rates, but on tolls, dues, &c. A considerable portion of the increase on the outstanding loans is attributed to the works acquired or undertaken by Municipal Corporations and other Local Bodies in their capacity of Sanitary Authorities. There has been a large expenditure on waterworks, gasworks, sewerage, and sewerage disposal, markets, street improvements, and similar undertakings. A considerable proportion of the expenditure, such as that for waterworks and gasworks, is the result of the Local Authorities themselves undertaking the supply of gas and water, instead of leaving the supply to companies. These undertakings, the outstanding debt incurred in respect of which exceeds £51,000,000, are to a large extent remunerative. In respect of the provision of schools under the Education Acts, there has also been a large capital expenditure during the period referred to. Notwithstanding the circumstances which I have mentioned, the increase of local indebtedness as so large that it is well worthy of attention; but I do not consider that any advantage would result from an inquiry into the financial condition of the Local Authorities of particular districts, and clearly an inquiry into the condition of the districts of all Local Authorities, which number many thousands, could not be undertaken.
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the statutory accounts of expenditure required to be provided under the Imperial Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act, and the Barracks Act for the year ending 31st March, 1891, will

 MR. MORTON : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether, as a number of newspapers now exceed the four-ounce limit for foreign postage, he can see his way to alter that limit, and place the postage for newspapers for places abroad on the same footing as regards weight as newspapers sent by post in the United Kingdom?
 MR. MORTON : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, with regard to the buying out of the French Treaty rights, the real difficulty is not our occupation of Egypt?
 MR. MORTON : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the Government intend to try and compel the Newfoundlanders, by a new enactment, to obey an old and repealed Act of Parliament (the Act of George the Fourth) against the wishes of the Parliament and people of that colony, who are anxious to settle the whole question by buying out the Treaty rights of France?
 MR. MORTON : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will introduce his Bill to consolidate the Gaming Laws during this Session of Parliament, so that it may be printed, and Members have an opportunity of considering its provisions?
 *DR. CAMERON : It was put down for Friday, and it might very well have been taken on Friday, instead of a number of small Bills being proceeded with. I may point out another reason for not pressing on this Motion now. The Second Reading of this Bill was taken on the first day of the re-assembling of Parliament after the Christmas holidays—a day most inconvenient for Scotch Members to be in their places. Therefore, we ought now to have a fair opportunity of discussing this matter. I think ample justification has been shown for the adjournment of the Debate.
 *DR. CAMERON : Of course if the eight hon. Gentleman says that he did not mean that, then everyone will accept his statement, but then the right hon. Gentleman said the Motion would be taken on Friday.
*(4.52.)  DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I beg to second that. The right hon. Gentleman was asked not to proceed with the Motion immediately after the Easter holidays, and he said if it were not taken before the adjournment it would not be proceeded with until the 9th April. Thereupon the Member for Stirling Burghs asked that the Motion

*(11.35.)  DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I rise to call attention to the position taken up by the Postmaster General with regard to the electric call and boy messenger system, and would have moved, if the Orders would have allowed—
 "That this House disapproves of the Postmaster General's refusal to allow the establishment by private agencies in this country of the electric call system, which American experience has shown to constitute a great practical public convenience." 1751 1752 Laughter Times 1753
 *DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : May I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman is aware that the Patronage Secretary to the Treasury sends, five times a week, written communications to the Government's supporters by messenger; whether that is not an infringement of the rights of the State; and whether the right hon. Gentleman proposes to take any steps to vindicate those rights in this case?
 SIR C. DALRYMPLE  (Ipswich) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he has in contemplation to remedy the great inconvenience to which British traders are put by the charges for transmitting printed matter to the Colonies; and whether he is aware that British firms, in order to obtain the cheap postage prevalent on the Continent to India, Australia, New Zealand, &c, send large packages of price-lists and circulars to an agent abroad, to be posted there?
 SIR C. DALRYMPLE : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if his attention has been called to the case of a large manufacturer at Ipswich, who on submitting a specimen of 20,000 circulars in new type somewhat resembling type writing, to be transmitted at the cost of £80 postage, was told that they could not be sent except at the letter rate, because
 "The Department cannot undertake to distinguish between type-written letters and letters or circulars produced by means of printing or other mechanical process in imitation of type-writing"; Postal Guide re "By means of ordinary type, engraving, lithography, or other mechanical process"?

 SIR E. BIRKBECK  (Norfolk, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he is aware of the fact that, on the 16th instant, one of the Palling lifeboats, stationed on the coast of Norfolk, was launched to the assistance of a stranded vessel, and rescued six lives; whether he is aware that she struck on the wreck of the "Danmark," and was seriously stove in: whether this is one of the wrecks for the removal of which the professional advisers of the Board of Trade refused to grant the funds under "The Removal of Wrecks Act (1877) Amendment Act, 1889," notwithstanding the recommendation of the Committee of the Trinity House that it was dangerous to lifeboat service; and whether he will give the necessary instructions for its speedy removal?
 MR. DIXON-HARTLAND  (Middlesex, Uxbridge) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General why the Post Office refuse to pass at the halfpenny rate circulars printed in characters resembling those of the type-writer; and whether he will give orders that they may in future be accepted?
 SIR G. BADEN-POWELL  (Liverpool, Kirkdale) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he has under consideration any arrangements for making local provision for courses of annual drill for men of the Royal Naval Reserve serving on Royal Naval Reserve vessels which are placed on distant stations and do not come to ports in the united Kingdom; and whether such facilities could be afforded at Hong Kong and Esquimalt for men serving on Pacific Mail Steamers earning the Admiralty subvention?
 SIR G. BADEN-POWELL : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether the Committee appointed to report upon the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers is specially instructed to collect the opinions of both officers and men who have the experience of actual service in either Force?
 MR. KIMBER  (Wandsworth) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his Department has information of the number of life-belts on board the  Utopia
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : As regards the first question of the hon. Member, I must refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer given to a similar question on the 26th of February, when it was stated that the Government of India would be asked to inquire into the allegations as to the number of opium shops; but that, according
 1649
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : The estimates are drawn as carefully as possible. The amount now estimated has been very carefully considered.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : I beg, in the absence of my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for India (Sir J. Gorst), to answer the question. The amount of £14,989,000 in the Budget for 1890–91 has, in the revised Estimate just published, been raised to £15,989,000. The Estimate for 1891–92 is £16,000,000. Unless the sum received up to the 31st instant exceeds £15,989,000, there will be no deduction from the £16,000,000 estimated for 1891–92.
*(7.48.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : The subject the hon. Member for Aberdeen (Mr. Bryce) has brought before the House is so important that I do not think any exception can be taken to his raising it. Yet I think that the hon. Gentleman, with his own experience at the Foreign Office, might have accepted for the present the assurances I gave him the other day that, as far as it could be done, the recommendations of the Commission were in course of execution. But the hon. Gentleman and others hare asked for a statement on the matter, and I hope I shall be able to satisfy the House that the Government are taking due and proper steps to carry out those recommendations. I quite agree with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton (Mr. H. H. Fowler) that the Report of such an important Commission is highly entitled to the consideration of the Government of the day, and that in particular the manner in which that Report deals with the Foreign Office demands the consideration of those who belonged to that Office. The Commissioners entered into the question with a care and consideration that certainly showed their full understanding of the very pecnliar character of the business of that Office. I will, without unduly detaining the House, endeavour to show that the recommendations of the Commission are not being neglected in any way. The hon. Member for Aberdeen placed in the front the question of the amalgamation of the Services. That is being attended to. The examinations for the two branches are being assimilated, and after the next examination gentlemen who passed the last examination will be eligible for appointments both in the Foreign Office and in the Diplomatic Service. There is one matter in which the recommendation of the Commission has not been exactly followed. The Secretary of State thinks the limit of age proposed is somewhat too narrow. It is recommended that the limit should be between 20 and 24, but the Secretary of State has determined to appoint gentlemen between the ages of 19 and 25, and in special cases above that age,
 1720 1721 1722 1723
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : I must ask for notice of the Question. Speaking offhand, I am not aware of any recent communication on the subject.
 MR. JACOBY  (Derbyshire, Mid) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in consideration of the general desire of the House, and the great importance of the question, he will give a day for the discussion of the Eight Hours Bill for miners?
 SIR J. SWINBURNE : Will the Tithes Bill come before the House again prior to the holidays?
*(5.44.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I am glad the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bradford has brought this subject before the House. The main principle of the Act of 1888 is to effect sales for the benefit of the benefices, and the Commissioners are bound to get the best prices they can, and the only way to obtain this is to put the land up to auction, when they are bound to accept the highest bidder, whether that offer is made by an adjoining landowner or any other solvent person. That, I consider, a great blot on the Bill of 18S8. The second blot is that, after the land is sold, the incumbent or the owner of the advowson is obliged to invest the money under Section 4 in Railway Debentures or Metropolitan Board of Works Stock or Consols, which do not yield more than 3 per cent. interest, and therefore it necessarily follows that the incumbent must get a high price for the land, a price above the real
 1695
 *SIR J. SWINBURNE : I will only point out that distinctly there would be an advantage in giving publicity to these sales by means of advertisement, and also I think an inquiry might be held prior to a sale of glebe which anybody interested might attend. A large portion of the purchase money also might be allowed to remain on mortgage. I do not agree altogether with the suggestion that the operation of the Act should be suspended immediately; because the great bulk of the glebe lands which have been sold have been a long way from the villages and are quite unfit for occupation by labourers. It is quite impossible for a labouring man to take an allotment for cultivation more than a mile from his cottage. In a great number of cases an adjoining proprietor has bought the land because it lies in the middle of his property. Landed proprietors have not, unfortunately, usually a large balance at their bankers, and the natural result is that a proprietor has to sell other land in another part of his estate in order to provide the funds for the purchase of the glebe land because it is advantageously situated, thus indirectly leading to small portions of land, situated suitably for allotments and small holdings, being thrown upon the market. The real fact is, these glebe lands are sold to the best advantage of the incumbent, and so long as the Act is in its present form I do not see how its operation can be otherwise.
 SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he will make arrangements for the collection of letters by the Post Office  employés
 *SIR J. SWINBURNE : Will the right hon. Gentleman give facilities to a private company to carry out such a collection of letters?
 SIR R. PAGET  (Somerset, Wells) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education if he will be good enough to state to the House what measures are now being taken, with regard to the day training colleges for teachers at Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Cardiff, Nottingham, Leeds, &c, to carry out the recommendation of the late Royal Education Commission, that in all day training colleges for teachers due provision should be made for the religious instruction of the students?
 SIR T. ESMONDE : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether, in the Kiltimagh district of County Mayo, the regulations for the reduction of judicial rents do not apply to the rents due on November last; and whether, although the Government is actually giving relief to the people of that neighbourhood, they are now compelled to pay their rents without any reduction?
 SIR T. ESMONDE : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he will allow the telegrams coming in to the telegraph station at Kiltimagh, County Mayo, to count, as well as those going out, towards making up the £68 required by the Post Office, in consideration of the fact that the former, equally with the latter, contribute towards the revenue of the station?
 SIR T. ESMONDE  (Dublin Co., S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware that charges have been made against Police Officer James Curry, of the F Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, in connection with the action of "Smyth  v
 SIR T. SUTHERLAND  (Greenock) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether it is the case that he has appointed a Committee to investigate the question of arranging a system of watertight bulkheads and compartments in merchant vessels; if any of the members of such Committee are shipowners, actually at the present time carrying on business in that capacity; if he will state the names of the members of the Committee, and the terms of the Reference placed before them for consideration, and Report; and whether they have been authorised to take evidence on the subject?
 SIR T. SUTHERLAND : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether it is the case that he has appointed a Committee to investigate the question of arranging a system of watertight bulkheads and compartments in merchant vessels; if any of the members of such Committee are shipowners, actually at the present time carrying on business in that capacity; if he will state the names of the members of the Committee, and the terms of the Reference placed before them for consideration, and report; and whether they have been authorised to take evidence on the subject?
 SIR W. LAWSON : What business will be taken before the Motion for the adjournment for the holidays is made?
 SIR W. LAWSON : Will the right hon. Gentleman instruct the Solicitor General to draw up a short abstract?
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, in view of the great importance of the decision of the House of Lords on the appeal case of "Sharpe  v
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : The Report of the Royal Commission mentioned the point as one for the consideration of Parliament, but did not suggest any means by which the Education Department could secure such provision. It is no part of the duty of the Department to inquire into the character or amount of the religious instruction provided, even in residential colleges, which it is assumed will be the care of those responsible for their maintenance; but by requiring that every day training college shall be under the direction of a committee who are responsible for the moral conduct and discipline of the students, and by seeing that all arrangements for the purpose are satisfactory, the Department has, in my opinion, gone to the full extent of its obligations in this important matter.
 VISCOUNT WOLMER  (Hants, Petersfield) : May I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman is aware that the proposal to nominate the Committee before the Easter adjournment has created great satisfaction in Scotland?
 MR. J. E. ELLIS : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether, in November last, orders were issued by the Military Authorities in Cork and Dublin authorising the issue to soldiers of intoxicating liquor in the Coffee and Recreation Rooms; and, if so, whether this is in accordance with the Queen's Regulations ( inter alia "The Coffee Room.… is maintained for the supply of refreshments of the following nature: tea, coffee, cocoa, non-alcoholic drinks, soup, fish, eggs, bacon, cooked and preserved meats, &c." "Smoking may be allowed in the Recreation Room, subject to the approval of Commanding Officers, and arrangements may also be made for the supply of tea, or coffee, or other refreshments at a regulated price; but the introduction of wine, beer, or spirits, under any pretence, is strictly prohibited."
 CAPTAIN MCALMONT  (Antrim, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he can now make any statement relative to the proposed mail route to and from the North of Ireland by Larne and Stranraer?
(3.30.)  MR. STAVELEY HILL  (Staffordshire, Kingswinford) : I simply wish to explain why I shall vote with my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon. It seems to me that if this is a remedy which is to be very seldom applied then it is scarcely worth while retaining it; but if this drastic remedy is to be continued, then, in fairness, let it be alle viated in every possible reasonable way.
(4.54.)  MR. PRITCHARD MORGAN  (Merthyr Tydvil) : Hon. Members from Wales who are not present could not have anticipated that the Government would take this action. I hold in my hand the Amendment to which the Commons agreed, "Nor in any case where no opposition has been given." The Attorney General now shields himself behind the allegations of innocence in this matter. There was an unmistakable pledge, so
 1794
(5.42.)  SIR G. TREVE LYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : I do not want to use strong language, but I think it is rather unfortunate that not a single word was said in the course of the last hour or two as to the intentions of the Government, and for this reason, that we on this Bench were prepared, directly the Motion was made that the Speaker should leave the Chair, to have risen and assured the Government that we would do all in our power to allow the Motion to be carried in time for the Motion for the Adjournment to be moved afterwards. I took a good deal of trouble to ascertain who intended to speak on the Motion "That the Speaker do leave the Chair," and I believe I absolutely ascertained that they were willing to enter into that course to the fullest measure. If the Order of the Day for the Speaker leaving the Chair had been disposed of I would have been disposed to ask the Government whether they would consent, under the circumstances, not to proceed with the two Bills next on the Paper, which are Bills upon which there is considerable difference of opinion.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Gentleman is out of order.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FER-GUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : The Bill now before the Committee is, I assure the hon. Gentleman, a matter of urgency, as it is necessary to give effect to the Postal Convention entered into with the French Government. The question is one that has been the subject of careful consideration, and I hope there will be no opposition to the Bill passing through the present stage.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : The question of a northern arm to the Colombo harbour has been recently again raised, and the Papers are now under the consideration of the consulting engineers. The Memorial, of the date referred to, related to questions of account, with a view to show that the construction of the existing breakwater had been remunerative, and a reply was
 1760
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I understood that an arrangement had been come to under which no business was to be taken after the Motion for Adjournment. We have already had a discussion on these understandings, and I should like to know whether the Government intend to carry out the understanding they came to with the House on this matter?
 DR. CLARK : I might have been willing to allow the Speaker to leave the Chair at an earlier hour, but now I cannot consent to such an understanding, because if the adjournment were moved
 1801
 DR. CLARK : On the understanding that I may speak on the point I desire to raise when the Adjournment is moved, I agree to the understanding.
 DR. CLARK : In Committee of Supply for several years I have called attention to the very inadequate grants given to Scotland for various purposes, as compared with those given to England and Ireland. Our position in Scotland is very peculiar. At the present time Scotland, partly owing to the industry of its people, and partly owing to the fact that the people drink a very highly taxed article, is paying about 2s. more per head of the population in taxation than England. We have to congratulate ourselves upon the one cause, but to deplore the other. Scotland has no Government dockyards, although we could build ships about 50 per cent. cheaper
 1802 1803 1804 1805 1806
 DR. CLARK : I do not agree to it.
 DR. CLARK : I frankly admit that so far as education in Scotland is concerned, where she gains—her results being higher—she gets more money. If we get more money in that respect we earn it.
(4.49.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I do not know if the hon. Gentleman was present when the pledge was given by the Attorney General. The whole thing would be settled if the hon. and learned Gentleman would only bring before the House the Rules he was drafting, and which he asked my hon. Friend to accept instead of this clause in the Bill. I remember the Divisions which took place on the Motions moved with the object of preserving the tithe as national property when it may be used for another purpose.
 1793
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : If the right hon. Gentleman expects to get through these two Bills this afternoon he is very much mistaken. There will be much discussion upon the proposal to omit an important clause of the Savings Banks Bill.
(5.4.)  DR. CLARK : I wish to ask some Member of the Government, on the Question of the Adjournment, what they intend to do with respect to Orders on the Paper?
*(6.30.)  THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : It is in contemplation to abolish the training squadron, but the opinion of naval officers on the subject will be taken.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : Her Majesty's ships  Emerald 1761 Pelican Forward
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The question whether the Labourers' Cottages (Ireland) Act should be included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill of this Session will be duly considered.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Minute inquiries are being made into the matter, but at present no decision has been arrived at.
(3.25.)  MR. JEFFREYS  (Hants, Basingstoke) : Although this same power of entering into possession has existed for the last 55 years, it has been very rarely exercised. My hon. Friend, who has taken much interest in tithe questions, only knows of one instance where the tithe owner availed himself of the power in default of payment of tithe. The fact is, that although it is a power that might be exercised or, as the hon. Member for Stockport says, threatened to be used, it has really been very little used. I venture to suggest to my hon. Friend (Mr. Gray) that he has rather exaggerated the importance of this subject. Let us take the case of a yeoman farmer, say with 100 acres, paying a high tithe of say 5s. an acre, and amounting to the comparatively small sum of £25, which on the ordinary tithe average would be reduced to £20. I think in such a case as that the yeoman farmer would never be likely to incur the penalty of the loss of his land for the sake of such a sum as that. I cannot help thinking that my hon. Friend exaggerates the importance of the subject. The remedy has existed for 55 years as a reserve, which sometimes has been threatened, to secure payment of tithe; and if it remains now, it is not likely to affect landowner or occupier more in the future than in the past, and, for my part, I do not think it is worth fighting about.
 MR. A. O'CONNOR  (Donegal, E.) : I also beg to ask the Chief Secretary whether he will state what has been actually done to relieve the distress in Ranafast, Lower Templecrone, County Donegal; and whether he will himself read the Report sent in by the Local Government Board Inspector after a house to house visitation in that district?
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member for Mid Glamorgan (Mr. S. T. Evans) has an Amendment on the Paper which will come first.
*(2.46.)  MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member for Maldon (Mr. Gray) has given notice of Amendments to this Amendment, but his object will be gained by simply negativing the proposal formally made by the Government "that the House agree with the Lords Amendment." If the Lords Amendment

 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member must confine himself to the Amendment before the House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! The Question is, the Adjournment of the Debate.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order order! The Question is, the Adjournment of the Debate.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 MR. PICKARD  (York, W.R., Normanton) : I beg to ask the Secretary of

(5.48.)  MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : There is considerable opposition to this Bill on its merits, and although I was personally willing and anxious to take the Bill last night there can be no question of obstruction if discussion is raised. The First Lord of the Treasury has said there are two uncontested Bills. I presume that one to which he refers
 1800
 *MR. C. W. GRAY : I sincerely trust that the House will not agree with these Amendments. In the Bill, when first presented, there was no reference to occupation by the tithe owner.
*(2.30.)  MR. C. W. GRAY  (Essex, Maldon) : I propose that the House should not agree with this Amendment, and I will explain briefly the position which I take.
*(2.49.)  MR. C. W. GRAY : I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the explanation. During the passage of the Bill through the House it was considered in the interests of the tithe owner that this particular point required alteration, and there was subsequently a proposal of  habere facias possessionem 1770 habere facias possessionem 1771 habere facias possessionem
 *MR. C. W. GRAY : I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman, but he will remember that when I referred to the turning of the screw I was comparing the present position of the yeoman farmer with that which he occupied prior to the Act of 1836, and I said the screw had been turned gradually at one period and another.
 *MR. C. W. GRAY : They were not my words.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : It is quite clear that the Government are not justified in pressing the Bill forward if there is any objection to that course. We should not have proceeded with it had we not believed that it was entirely unopposed; but, under the circumstances, we shall consent to Progress being reported.
 MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that the tonnage of vessels frequenting the harbour of Colombo, Ceylon, in 1890, exceeded the tonnage of 1889 by 185,000 tons, and the tonnage of 1889 that of "of 1888 by 576,000 tons; also that on more than one occasion lately, all the port accommodation was taken up, and steamers had to anchor outside the harbour from want of room, though they were anxious to obtain the protection and facilities offered by the port; whether, under these circumstances, the Government will consider the question of the construction of the "northern arm" to the harbour, and will promptly consider and give an answer to the Memorial addressed to the Secretary of State by the Chamber of Commerce of Ceylon, on the 21st of November, 1888, on this subject; and if the Secretary of State for the Colonies has already replied on the subject of that Memorial, what was his reply?
(4.27)  MR. RANDELL  (Glamorgan, Gower) : It is difficult to see why the Government agreed to the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend, and now assent to what has been done by the House of Lords. I must say that the fact of the Government assenting to the
 1788 bonâ fide
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many warders are at present employed in the prisons of England and Wales as Acting Governors and Acting Matrons respectively; and how many temporary warders are employed in those prisons instead of regular warders? I beg also to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he has considered the Petition of the prison warders, drawing attention to excessive hours of duty, and other grievances; and whether he is prepared to introduce some amelioration of their conditions of service?
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : I find that an experiment has been made in Ireland by the Local Military Authorities of allowing men to purchase one pint of beer with their supper in the Recreation Room. This has been done as tending, in their opinion, to reduce outside drinking. The matter has not been before brought to my notice, and all I should like to say at present is that I will communicate with the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland on the subject.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : Yes, Sir; I propose to submit to Her Majesty an alteration in the Warrant which would give a discretionary power of the character described by my hon. and gallant Friend.
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, having regard to the number of Notices of rejection of the Inflammable Liquids Bill on the Order Book, and to the possible effects of further uncertainty in raising the prices of the cheaper qualities of oils, he will withdraw the Bill?
*(2.38.)  MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : The right hon. Gentleman says that no alteration is made in the existing law. I am of a different opinion, and I shall support the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend in this sense, that there is a valid distinction between derelict farms and holdings upon which there have been reasonable concessions between the landlord and tenant in regard to the value of agricultural produce. If Her Majesty's Government are prepared consistently to follow out the object with which the Bill was introduced last year, they ought to find some way out of the difficulty.
*(3.21.)  MR. CHANNING : The hon. Member seemed to prefer an imputation against hon. Members on this side—and I am not sure whether he included the hon. Member for Maldon also—that we wish to withdraw from the tithe owner altogether the remedy of entering on possession, but no one wishes to make any such suggestion. What we do say, and what we intend to affirm as far as we can, is that this right of taking possession as a means of recovering tithe rent-charge when payment is withheld should be accompanied by equitable conditions. With all respect to what has fallen from the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade, will he allow me by simple analogy to point out how the argument of the hon. Member who has just spoken in reference to waste falls to the ground? Those who are familiar with proceedings under the Agricultural Holdings Act will know that it is a just illustration. The landlord, where a claim under the Act is not set up, does not in general require payment for waste and dilapidation; but whenever the tenant does set up a claim under the Agricultural Holdings Act, then the landlord sets up his counter claim from the farmer. The practical effect of this is to show that the remedy at Common Law for waste is one which fails to be exercised oven in the hands of the most powerful members of the community, and it is therefore wholly inadequate to hold out this general principle as a remedy to which the poor farmer may appeal. I hold that the words suggested on a previous occasion by the President of the Board of Trade clearly defining the duty of the tithe owner that he shall cultivate according to good husbandry, and in a suitable way according to the custom of the district, and avoid the commission or permission of waste, are words that are required for the protection of the tenant. It should be elearly and definitely laid down in this Act, not left as a remedy in the background that may be appealed to on
 1776
*(3.15.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON : We are labouring under considerable disadvantage in having to discuss this without having before us the Amendments made by the Commons in the Lords' Amendments. In the first place, hon. Members do not realise that Sub-section 3 has disappeared altogether. The question is whether, if the Lords Amendment in its new form is accepted, there will be sufficient security for the proper cultivation of the land. I decline to admit that the words which the Lords have struck out are mere surplusage, and I appeal to the Attorney General to say under what provision a tithe owner on taking
 1774
*(2.34.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON  (Suffolk, Eye) : The Lords' Amendment as it is now sent down to us differs only from their first Amendment in phraseology, and I object to it as bearing hardly on the yeoman farmer. It provides that if there is no sufficient distress the person entitled to the sum ordered to be recovered may proceed to obtain possession of the lands under Section 82 of the Tithe Act, 1836. That practically amounts to the same thing; the difference being simply between "tweedledum and tweedledee."
*(4.46.)  MR. F. S. STEVENSON : The course the Government have taken on this Bill in accepting Amendments moved in the Lords by persons other than members of the Government is one which may be fraught with serious consequences.
 *MR. F. S. STEVENSON : That strengthens my argument. By accepting this Amendment the Government made themselves responsible for it; and the question is whether they have shifted in any degree from the position taken up in a previous Debate. It seems to me that the contention of the Attorney General rests on the difference between opposition and notice of opposition. He admits that the acceptance of the Amendment was an afterthought, and that at the time he spoke in the House he did not contemplate the contingency the Amendment is designed to meet. The hon. and learned Gentleman must remember that he gave a pledge to the House and that a pledge depends not so much on the manner in which it is understood by the man who makes it as on the manner in which it is understood by those to whom it is made. The Welsh Members distinctly have a different impression of the pledge from that of the Attorney General. I appeal to the Government to consent to the disagreement on the part of the House to the Amendment.
 MR. SEAGER HUNT  (Marylebone, W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether there was any foundation for the statement that appeared in the  Daily News
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he can inform the House which of Her Majesty's ships of war are employed off the Canadian coast or the coast of Newfoundland, in keeping the peace between the fishermen of Newfoundland and those of France; what part, if any, of the expense of thus protecting the interests of the fisheries in Newfoundland is borne by the colonists, or whether it is wholly borne by the taxpayers of this country; and whether it is true that the Canadian Authorities have refused to submit the claims of the fishermen to arbitration?
 MR. HOWELL : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether he is in a position to state to the House the terms of Reference relating to the proposed Royal Commission on Labour; and whether he is in a position to give the names of the proposed Commissioners?
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : May I ask what will be the Order of Business on the re-assembling of the House after the Easter holidays?
(4.36.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : The hon. and learned Attorney General, in his very clear and interesting speech, showed that the Government have gone very far to meet the wishes of the Welsh Members, and I think he showed likewise that in his opinion they had gone as far as their pledges led them. I do not wonder, however, that the Welsh Members do not think that everthing promised them in previous Debates has been carried out, and I own I must join in that opinion. It appears to me to be a very small point. The Attorney General is reported to have said, in reply to the hon. and learned Member for Mid Glamorgan (Mr. S. Evans) on the 10th of February ( Hansard "There is no doubt as to the way in which costs in undefended cases ought to be dealt with, and the Government will take care that they shall he dealt with by rules of the Rule Committee. Under these rules the costs of employing a solicitor will not be allowed where no notice of defence has been given. If the tithe payer admits that he owes the money, a rule that no costs shall be allowed beyond the fees will meet the objections that have been made." "I think my undertaking ought to have been sufficient, for it is a most unusual practice to put, say, half a dozen rules on the face of an Act of Parliament. The words of "the rules which I have read are clear, that the costs of employing a solicitor will not be allowed in any case in which no notice of defence is entered, and in cases in which there is such notice they will only be allowed for work done subsequent to such notice." 1791 "An application to a County Court for an order under this Act may be made on behalf of the tithe owner by his agent, although not a solicitor, and on such application the costs either of a solicitor or of a witness shall not be allowed in any case where notice of defence has not been given, and when such notice has been given the costs of a solicitor shall only be allowed for work done subsequent to the notice."
 SIR G. TREVELYAN : I think the right hon. Gentleman has met us in a fair manner, and I shall consider it my duty to be here first thing on Monday the 6th, and bear testimony, if it is needed, to the understanding.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : It is quite evident we cannot get through the two Bills and dispose of the Motion for Adjournment this afternoon. I would therefore support the suggestion of the hon. Member for Northampton, namely, that we should come to an understanding that the Speaker should leave the Chair without discussion on Monday the 6th of April, and that the Government should now move the adjournment for the holidays.
*(5.38.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I think there has been some little misunderstanding. I was not aware the Government were going to put off Supply. I hope that even now it is not too late to get the Speaker out of the Chair. There was a distinct understanding that the Speaker was to leave the Chair on the Civil Service Estimates before moving the Adjournment. If that had been done I had intended to ask the Government not to proceed with this and the Savings Bank Bill. Let us deal with this question as sensible businesslike men. No one wishes to prolong this Sitting; we all want to get away. The right Gentleman met us in a spirit of the greatest fairness last night
 1798
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Order, order!
 MR. LABOUCHERE : The hon. Member for Caithness had intended to raise an important question on the Motion "That the Speaker do leave the Chair." I represented to him that perhaps it would be desirable if he deferred the matter, as it was to the interest of all Members that they should get away as soon as possible. The hon. Gentleman consented to defer the question. Other hon. Members gave up their right to speak on the Motion, under the impression that there was some sort of understanding that if they did Mr. Speaker would leave the Chair, and the Motion for Adjournment would be moved. As to this Order, the Amendment of the hon. Member for Camborne goes to the root of the Bill, and the hon. Member will not be left to discuss it himself, as there are many Members who share his views. Under these circumstances, I do not think it is probable that the Bill will pass before 10 minutes to 7 o'clock. There is no desire, when the House meets after the Recess, to discuss the Motion "That the Speaker leave the Chair," and I and my hon. Friends will be prepared to consider the Estimates at once on Monday week. I would suggest that, on the understanding that there is no discussion on Monday week on the Motion "That the Speaker leave the Chair," the First Lord of the Treasury should now move the adjournment. I certainly think he would gain by accepting such a proposal.
(4.29.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : It really is very sad to think that after we have passed a Bill here and sent it to the Lords, and have then considered their Amendments and sent the measure up again with an agreement on both sides of the House in favour of certain alterations, the Lords should step in and strike out those alterations. The Attorney General says he defies any fair person to get up in this House, and say after his speech that the pledge given by the Government has been violated. Well, I am prepared to say that, as far as I understand the matter, after listening to what has fallen from my hon. Friend, and from the Attorney General, the pledge has been absolutely violated. I am strengthened in my belief on this point by the indignation shown by the Attorney General. I have always observed that when a lawyer shows indignation there is something concealed behind it. The omission of these words was moved by Lord Selborne. It appears to me that the Liberal Unionists are as troublesome in the House of Lords as they are in this House. Either these words mean something or they do not. If they mean nothing why do not the Government consent to their re-insertion? The Attorney

 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed that the Statistical Abstract of Mining Inspectors' Reports for 1890 will be ready for issue by Thursday next.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Prison Commissioners that there are 12 chief warders in charge of prisons in England and Wales, and 32 female warders who have charge of the female Department in those prisons. The number of temporary warders necessarily varies from day to day according to the requirements of the Service. A Departmental Committee is now sitting for the purpose of investigating fully the grievances of these officers, and I await their Report before coming to any decision.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The Commissioners of Lunacy inform me that Dr. Thomas Bond signed the certificate upon which the urgency order was founded; and they believe that he addressed Mrs. Cathcart in one of the Courts, where she was (as they are informed) for the purpose of a Divorce Court motion. The Commissioners have no information as to the third paragraph. The answer to the fourth paragraph is, Yes. The urgency order was signed by Mrs. Cathcart's husband. The Commissioners have refused two applications to see Mrs. Cathcart. They have done so in the interest of the patient, and wholly without reference to any other interest or person. Mrs. Cathcart has had several interviews with a solicitor selected by herself.
 MR. MATTHEWS : My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk (Sir E. Birkbeck) will see that I have anticipated his question in the answer I am about to give to the hon. Member for Northampton (Mr. Channing). The Notices of opposition to this Bill are so numerous as to render its chances of passing this year very remote. I propose, therefore, as soon as the Memorandum, which will be issued in a few days, is before the House, to move that a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the wholes subject, and to await their Report before asking the House to legislate.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham E. : I am informed by the Secretary for Scotland that he is not at present in a position to say whether a public inquiry would be advisable, the matter still being under investigation by the Criminal Authorities in the usual manner.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : The facts are as follow:—The Controller of the Savings Bank, in January last, summoned the high officers of his Department and expressed his fear that they had not exercised over their subordinates the influence which it was expected they would have exerted. They replied that they had most emphatically discountenanced the action of the junior officers of the Savings Bank, and assured the Controller of their thorough loyalty to the Department. They took advantage of the opportunity to urge their view that they ought all to have better salaries, and their regret that that view was not shared by the authorities. I have received the Memorials of the 17th and 20th January, referred to, and have answered them. I do not see any necessity for the inquiry asked for; but I hope very soon to be able to adopt measures greatly to reduce the extra duty, which appears to me to constitute a reasonable and legitimate grievance.
 *MR. RAIKES : James Whittaker was dismissed, not for abusive language to the police—which as the hon. Member states, Whittaker denies having employed—but for obstructing the police in the discharge of their duties. Whittaker had been appointed less than three months before the occurrence took place, and was still on probation. I shall be willing, however, if Whittaker expresses his sincere regret for his conduct, to allow him to resume duty, on probation, as an auxiliary postman.
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I would point out to the hon. Baronet that it was fully understood that no business would be taken after the Motion for Adjournment over the Easter holidays. If the Government had regarded this Bill as important they should have put it in front of that Motion, and I say that the fact of its being placed after the

 MR. DALTON  (Donegal, W.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he will lay upon the Table of the House a copy of the Local Government Board Inspector's Report on the state of Ranafast, and the entire parish of Lower Templecrone; also the Police Reports on the same parish; and whether, as he has already admitted that there is considerable distress in Lower Templecrone, which was causing the Government great anxiety, the Government propose to start immediately some relief works, such as road-making, in the district?
 DR. FITZGERALD : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware that the Labourers' Cottages (Ireland) Act expires this Session, and if he intends to move its renewal?
 DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with regard to the seizure of Mrs. Mary Cathcart, if he will state the name of the doctor who signed the certificate previous to her seizure under an urgency order; if the doctor examined her by addressing the lady without her consent in one of the Courts in which she was defending an action; if the doctor was employed by the plaintiff in the said action; if the doctor is one of the medical men who afterwards signed a certificate for Mrs. Cathcart's detention in a private lunatic asylum; if the plaintiff in the action referred to is the person who procured the urgency order; and is he aware that Mrs. Cathcart has made several applications to see her friends, and that all access to her has been refused by the Lunacy Commissioners, acting under the authority of the plaintiff in the action which Mrs. Cathcart was engaged in defending at the time of her seizure?
(6.31.)  MR. J. F. X. O'BRIEN  (Mayo, S.) : I am sorry I do not at this moment see the Chief Secretary for Ireland in his place, as I am anxious to know what he proposes to do in regard to an urgent matter to which I called his attention by letter yesterday. Perhaps the Secretary to the Treasury will be good enough to call his attention to the matter. I refer to the supply of potato seed to agricultural labourers in certain places in Ireland, and certainly in the Union of Phillipstown, County Mayo. The Guardians there are anxious to supply potato seed to their labourers, but according to the Act it cannot be supplied sooner than the month of May, when it will be too late to be of use. I should like this matter to be brought under the notice of the Chief Secretary so that some means may be adopted for enabling the Guardians to supply seed potatoes to a very deserving class of people. No doubt this necessity is not limited to the Phillipstown Union but extends also to other Unions. The seed time is drawing to an end and the matter is becoming urgent.
 MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : If there is one person to blame for the difficulty in which we are in at the present time it is the First Lord of the Treasury. The difficulty arises through the second Order of the Day being passed over. In giving up their right to speak on that Order hon. Members were not desirous that the Electoral Disabilities Bill and the Savings Banks Bill should be pushed forward this afternoon. The Bill now under consideration is one which none of us like—indeed we regard it as a paltry measure dealing with a great subject. Even if we dispose of it, it will be impossible to get the Savings Banks Bill through this afternoon, as there are several important points which must necessarily be discussed.
(6.29.)  SIR J. COLOMB  (Tower Hamlets, Bow, &c.) : I wish to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether there is any truth in the current report that it is in contemplation to abolish the training squadron, and whether he can give the House an assurance that before any such step is taken the opinion of naval officers on the subject will be ascertained, and due weight will be given to their views?
(4.34.)  MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe) : It strikes me that the issue now before the House raises a very important question as to the value we are to place on the assurances that proceed from the Treasury Bench as to the manner in which business is to be conducted. I listened with very great attention to the speech of the hon. and learned Attorney General and it entirely failed to convince me that the Government have maintained in the House of Lords the attitude we had a right to expect from them in view of the assurances given in this House. This is not the first time this question has arisen during the continuance of the
 1790
 MR. J. E. ELLIS  (Nottingham, Rushcliffe)  had a similar Question on the Paper.
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether no promotion of clerks to the higher grade of the Second Division, with the exception of a few already in receipt of £250 per annum, has been made; and whether, seeing that such promotion was provided for by the Order in Council issued some 12 months ago, he can say when the question of such promotion, on which he stated on 17th June, 1890, that material progress had been made, is likely to be finally settled?
(5.0.)  MR. DILLWYN  (Swansea, Town) : I heard the whole of the Debate

 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : We had nothing to do with the fact that Lord Selborne moved this particular Amendment.
 Sir M. HICKS BEACH  rose in his place, and claimed to move, "That the Question be now put."
*(2.32.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I do not think that the House ought to agree to the Amendment. The writ does not now apply to derelict farms only, and there is no reason why it should. I may instance a case which is within my own knowledge. A gentleman had a large house in the country with a park of considerable extent around it. One part of the park, including the building, was in one parish and the rest in another parish, and it would be possible so to arrange as to prevent the tithe owner in the second parish from levying any distres upon the land in that parish. The object of the Lords Amendment is merely to retain in the cases dealt with by the clause, the powers conferred by the existing law.
*(2.48.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : My hon. Friend is quite mistaken. The words in the Bill provided that the officer of the Court should have the same right of recovery as now, which included the right of entry. In Committee the word "recovery" was altered to "distraint" at the request of the right hon. Member for Derby (Sir W. Harcourt).
*(2.47.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I beg to move that the House do agree with the Lords Amendment.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I do not charge the hon. Member with the responsibility of the words; I am only pointing out what would have been their effect. I hope the House will be content to accept this Amendment without any lengthened Debate. It does not alter the existing law, nor does it place the tithe owner in any better position than he now occupies.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Very well; I will modify the expression. I say there is no turn of the screw here. The right which the Lords' Amendment gives to the tithe owner he already possesses under the Act of 1836. Again, the words which the Lords have struck out were mere surplusage, because by the law, as it at present stands, the tithe owner upon taking possession will be compelled to cultivate the land in a proper manner, because he is bound not to permit or commit waste. Moreover the provisions of this Bill are not, as the hon. Member seems to think, generally to the disadvantage of the occupying owner, who is now just as liable to be distrained upon, and in the absence of distraint to have his land entered upon, as he will be if the Lords' Amendment becomes law. The only difference is that the distraint will be carried out by the officer of the Court instead of by the tithe owner. And as to the Bill drawing from the yeoman farmer his last drop of blood, it will, on the contrary, give him this great advantage—that whereas he may now be distrained upon for the whole amount of the tithe, whatever the annual value of his land, in future he will only be distrained upon to the amount of two-thirds of the assessment of the land to Schedule B of the Income Tax. The fact is, that the position of the tithe-payer will be considerably improved under the Bill, and I hope the hon. Member will not persist in his opposition. Although the Government at one time were willing to insert words putting an obligation on the tithe owner taking possession not to permit or commit waste, I have since discovered, from the highest authority, that such a proviso was absolutely unnecessary, as the

*(2.37.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : May I be allowed a word in explanation? The change in phraseology adopted by the Lords makes it clear that the existing law is to be maintained. The Amendment, as sent down by the Lords before, might have been interpreted as making a considerable alteration in the existing law, and it did, in fact, make one alteration—the substitution of a decision of the County Court for the interposition of a jury.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Because they are the law now.

 MR. R. POWER  (Waterford) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if his attention has been called to the case of James Whittaker, town postman at Waterford, dismissed for alleged abusive language to a policeman, which language James Whittaker denies having used, and states that he can bring evidence to that effect; and whether, inasmuch as the case against Whittaker rests on the unsupported word of a policeman, while Whittaker who is an  employé
*(6.20.)  MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I desire to say a word or two in regard to an Indian grievance, and I avail myself of the opportunity at this late hour, because if the matter is delayed until the Easter holidays are over, it will be too late to remedy the evil complained of. The matter was dealt with in a question I put down on the Paper for today, but it was not possible to ask that question. I desire to call the attention of the hon. or right hon. Gentleman opposite who represents the Government of India at this moment, to an Indian grievance. It springs out of what is called the Abkari system. Two years ago we passed a Resolution against that system, and the result of that Resolution was that the Government of India adopted certain improvements in the administration of the law in this regard. The improvements were given effect to in a Minute the Government issued about a year ago, and one of the points in that Minute was this: it was set forth that the sites of the liquor shops should, as far as possible, be at a distance from market places, schools, hospitals, places of worship, factories, and places of public resort. The reason of this decision was that great complaints were made all over India of the Government planting liquor shops close to factories, churches, and schools with the view of inducing people to enter them. Great demoralisation was caused by this practice of placing inducements in the way of people to indulge in liquor. In consequence of the representations made to them, the Government issued the Minute of which I have spoken, requiring the collectors to ascertain the public opinion as much as possible before planting the liquor shops. It required them to exercise a kind of local option in the matter. A great grievance has just been caused in the town of Madura, which is situated a short distance from Madras. Seventeen liquor shops were advertised to be opened in most objectionable
 1807
*(4.48.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE : The pledge given by the Government was clear. It was that where there was no opposition there should be no costs, and that pledge is amply carried out without these words. Every one who understands the matter will see that without notice of opposition when the receiver is going to take possession, it is possible for the tithe payer to put difficulties in his way. The insertion of these words would enable him to do so without being liable to the costs which his wrongful action had caused.
*(3.17.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : The tithe owner has two remedies against the occupying owner: distraint and taking possession, and he can only use the second in case the first fails. One could almost count on the fingers of one hand the cases in which, during the last five-and-fifty years, the tithe owner has actually put in force the remedy of taking possession. The threat was almost always sufficient. I know a case in which I acted professionally, in which a clergyman recovered his tithe from one of the richest men in the country simply by threatening a writ of possession. But if the power is taken away, the tithe owner in the case of pasture lands may lose his income, and be left without any remedy at all; because the occupier, having driven off his cattle and left nothing to distrain upon, might snap his fingers at the tithe owner. I have a letter here from a country rector in Suffolk, pointing out that in his case £300 of his tithe comes from pasture land, 50 occupying owners paying an average of £6, and if they found he would be left without remedy, if there were nothing on the land to distrain upon, they might take care the cattle were removed. I think the Legislature ought not to deprive the tithe owner of this remedy. Then the hon. Member says there is no provision against waste. But there is no necessity for such a provision. I speak under correction, but I have good authority for saying that there is nobody but an absolute owner in fee simple who is not liable for damage or waste. Everyone who holds land, whether he be mortgagee, trustee, or tenant, unless there is absolute provision for the contrary, is liable for damage or waste, and the tithe owner will be in exactly the same position when
 1775
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : I will not go beyond that. I only wish to urge my hon. Friends on this side of the House to preserve this public property while making reasonable changes connected with it; and not to allow their natural disposition to oppose Government propositions to lead them to sacrifice their principles.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I look upon legislation in respect to tithe rent-charge from a national point of view. Over and over again it has been admitted on this side, though just now it seems to be forgotten, that tithe is national property, used at the present time for Church purposes; but by-and-by, as many of us hope, to be devoted to public purposes, after fairly considering the claims of vested interests. Having in mind that this is a vast national fund, it behoves us to preserve it for the benefit of the people. This fund arises from a charge upon the land, and unless you provide full security for its recovery it will disappear, or almost certainly its redemption value—and a Commission is now considering this question of redemption—will be materially reduced. There are only two ways of recovering the tithe—first, by distress; and, secondly, if there is not sufficient distress by taking possession of the land. The public have the greatest interest in preserving this right to possession; it is part of the hold which the public have on the titheable land of the country, and if you abandon that and leave only recovery by distress you reduce the value of this national property. Necessarily you do this if you make recovery more difficult and expensive, not to say, in some cases,

 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : I regret I am not in a position to give the information asked for. It is not, I think, desirable that I should give the terms of Reference without giving at the same time the names of the Commissioners, and this last information is not yet complete owing to the delay which has taken place in answering the invitation of the Government to serve on the Commission. I hope, however, that the Commission will be completed in the course of a day or two.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : The Bills on the Paper for consideration to-day will be proceeded with on Monday after the Recess, and, if not reached on Monday, will be proceeded with on the following day.
*(5.36.)  THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : The hon. Member appeals to me to support him in an obstructive course.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I repeat the words, and I refuse to agree to the obstructive Motion of the hon. Member. The hon. Member is aware that there was a Parliamentary understanding last evening that we should get the Speaker out of the Chair on the Civil Service Estimates. That understanding has failed, and under the circumstances I am justified in asking the House to proceed with a Bill against the principle of which there has been no Division. I hope right hon. Gentlemen opposite will assist me in endeavouring to carry forward the business of the House.
*(5.41.)  MR. W. H. SMITH : I am afraid that it is impossible to go back upon the Order of the House postponing Supply until next Monday week. I may say that I received communications which satisfied me that we could not have got the Speaker out of the Chair this evening without the Closure. [ Cries of
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : If there is a distinct Parliamentary understanding which will be observed by hon. Gentlemen above and below the Gangway opposite, that the Speaker do leave the Chair on the Order being called on Monday week, I will accept the suggestion of the right hon. Gentleman.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : Am I to understand there is an hon. Gentleman who dissents from the agreement? If so it is impossible to carry on business.
(6.33.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : The Committee dealing with the financial relations of the three countries will have before it not only all the questions which the hon. Member for Caithness has mentioned, but many others besides. The hon. Member may rely upon the Representatives of Scotland oh that Committee seeing that full justice is done to Scotland in eliciting all the information necessary and clearing up any doubts. As I have said before, I do not think it is possible to compare like with like, but I have had taken out for me a few figures with a view of testing, at any rate in a general way, the proportions as between Scotland and England, referred to by the hon. Member. Comparing the cost with the population, I find that the population of Scotland is about one-seventh that of England, and that as regards education and the salaries of the administrative staff the ratio of expenditure of Scotland to England is about 1 to 5½. The expenditure connected with inspection work is about 1 to 4——
 MR. JACKSON : That is not the point at all. I am dealing with the salaries of the administrative Staff, and I admit the point the hon. Member now makes. The proportion of expense in connection with lunacy boards is as 1 to 3; paupers and Local Government Board, 1 to 9; prisons, 1 to 4; and registration, 1 to 5. Taking the special expenditure in the two countries on the work of registration the figures work out remarkably alike: In England the cost per head of the population is ·3475 of a penny, and in Scotland it is ·3484. The figure is slightly higher in the case of Scotland. As to the other Departments to which I have referred it will be seen that, except as regards paupers and local government on which the expenditure for England is rather higher, relatively, than in Scotland, the expenditure for Scotland is higher than that for England. But I am quite sure the question will be most thoroughly threshed out in the Committee. The figures I have given go to confirm previous Estimates which I

 MR. JACKSON : I am sorry that I am unable to give my hon. Friend the answer he desires, but I have not yet been able to obtain a final decision on the question.

 *MR. TOMLINSON  (Preston) : I rise to order. Is it in Order for the hon. Gentleman, on a Motion to report Progress on this Bill, to discuss the provisions of the Savings Banks Bill?
*(3.27.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I recognise in this Amendment another attempt on the part of the Church Party to get as much as they can out of the owners and occupiers of land. I gather that from the speech of the hon. Member for Maldon, who understands this question thoroughly, and has done his best throughout these discussions on behalf of the occupiers of land. But that the ties of Party discipline are too strong, I am sure there are many hon. Members on the other side who would support him with their votes. The hon. Member has described this Amendment as another turn of the screw, and I have no doubt it is so. It should be observed that in the other House not only is the Church directly interested in this matter, but there is a strong representation of owners of Church livings. I do not know how many Church livings are owned by Members of the House of Lords, but certainly a great many, and hence there there is a strong interest in keeping up Church incomes for the benefit of relatives and friends. I am sorry to see that some Churchmen regard this matter solely from that point of view—I mean the getting as much as possible out of a Church living. They do not care how they get the money or from whom they get it so long as they do get it, and this is an opinion I have formed not only from observation, but from personal experience. Some two or three years ago a clergyman for his own benefit put the law in motion for the redemption of tithe on some property of mine. I did not want the tithe redeemed, but the parson did, and he had his way, and I unwillingly had to pay all the expenses. I found, on calculating the cost, that I had been charged more than I ought to have paid, and that I, the leaseholder, was mulcted for the freeholder's share. So I went to the agent and the Land Commissioners, and they said, "Yes, it is quite correct; you are paying everybody's share. We get it from you because it is easier to do so, and you must get it from the freeholder as best you can." That is an illustration of what the Church has done within my own knowledge, and similar is the effect of this Amendment. But I should like to see the Church turn its attention in other directions than this attempt to get money by turnings of the

 SIR E. BIRKBECK  desired to ask his right hon. Friend whether he really realised the strong feeling there was with reference to this Bill among the small shopkeepers in the rural districts; and whether he would not withdraw the Bill and refer the whole subject—not the Bill—to a Select Committee?
 SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN  (Durham, S.E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War if, in view of the large number of Majors, most of whom hold the post of second in command, who are each month being removed from their regiments owing to the operation of the 48 years age clause, he would be prepared to place in the hands of H.R.H. the Commander-in-Chief discretionary power which would enable him to recommend the retention in their regiments for a short fixed period after this age is reached, of certain officers who, in the opinion of His Royal Highness, possess special fitness for the position of Regimental or Battalion Commandant?
(2.36.)  SIR H. DAVEY  (Stockton) : As I interpret the Lords' Amendment, it brings into operation the whole machinery of the 82nd section of the Act of 1836. Therefore a person desiring to obtain possession under the 82nd section must adopt the procedure indicated in that section.

(4.58.)  MR. JOICEY  (Durham, Chester-le-Street) : Sir, I was present when this bargain was made between the Attorney General as a Member of Her Majesty's Government and my hon. and learned Friend. I confess my reading of his words is that the Attorney General confesses that my hon. and learned Friend got the better of him. But, Sir, we commercial men have always been of the impression that a bargain is a bargain and ought to be adhered to, and that when one party has got the worst of it he has no right to attempt to upset that bargain. It is perfectly clear that the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend was accepted without any qualification whatever. It went to the House of Lords, and the Prime Minister moved it. Then Lord Selborne moved an Amendment to it, and the Representatives of Her Majesty's Government in the other House accepted it, thus breaking the pledge given by the Government in this House. I think that is most unfair treatment. When the bargain was made every Welsh Member had a full opportunity of discussing it. Now their mouths are practically closed. I repeat that such treatment is unfair, and I shall certainly vote with my hon. and learned Friend.
*(5.4.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE : We have had a good deal of hair-splitting on this matter, but really Her Majesty's Government come down here and say, "Here is an Order from the House of Lords." I repudiate that altogether.
(3.46.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : I confess to finding great difficulty in following the legal view in this matter. I believe the clause has three distinct legal processes to be gone through prior to the entering upon possession of the land, and for all these proceedings and applications the expenses are to fall upon the tithepayer. Then these Lords Amendments are rushed upon us before we have really had time to consider their bearing
 1782
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Will the hon. Member pardon me? I have not in the whole of this Session corrected a single thing except a printer's error.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : It was distinctly stated by myself that the law provided for it now.
 SIR R. WEBSTER  indicated assent.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : In undefended cases, yes.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : There will be none in that case. I will explain when my hon. and learned Friend has finished his speech.
(4.15.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I do not intend to adopt the tone which my hon. and learned Friend has assumed in the attack he has just made upon the Government. No doubt it is a very convenient thing to be able to launch a Debate of this kind by alleging that there has been a breach of faith or a breach of arrangement. Having regard to what has passed between the Government and those who, in conjunction with my hon. and learned Friend, have been conducting the opposition to this Bill most fairly, I think the allegation my hon. and learned Friend has made was singularly uncalled for. I will leave the House to form their own judgment when they have heard the very brief statement I am going to make. I go back in no shape or form from the substance of what I have said. In undefended cases there will be no costs. The subsequent alterations made by the Lords make it impossible to adhere to the words as they originally stood. As the clause now stands there are three cases in which no costs can be claimed. The House will see how unjust it is to allege a breach of faith. Now the point is whether we have provided there should be no costs in undefended cases. In the first place, no costs, either for solicitor or witness, shall be claimed in any case where the amount claimed is paid without further proceeding. Secondly, no costs will be paid, in any case where notice of intention to apply for time to pay the tithe owner's claim has been given. Thirdly, in any case where notice of opposition has been given within the prescribed time the costs of solicitor will only be allowed for work done subsequent to that notice. I say most distinctly no costs will be allowed in really undefended cases. In addition to the three enactments which were inserted, these are the words that are now insisted on: "Nor in any case where no notice of opposition has been given." I appeal to any Member of this. House to consider this matter fairly and impartially. Take this case: A receiver is appointed; objection is taken to the receiver receiving the rent, and it is necessary in consequence of the obstructive actions of the tithe payer for the tithe owner, through the receiver, to apply to the Court. Costs are thereby

 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : Hear, hear!
 SIR. R. WEBSTER : I am very sorry I have not got them here; but, as far as I know, they are in accordance with what I have stated to the House.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : May I point out that there is only one set of Amendments to this Bill, standing in the name of the hon. Member for Camborne, and that there cannot be any lengthened discussion upon it? The hon. Member himself appealed to the House last night to allow the Bill to be taken after 12 o'clock. It is important that the Bill should be passed at an early period of the Session.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I think we ought to have the adjournment in order to get the Rules from the Attorney General, who has placed his recollection against ours in this matter. Why does he not produce the Rules, which, no doubt, are in some pigeon-hole of some office. Surely the Government ought themselves to assent to the Motion, seeing that the majority of Welsh Members who are interested in the matter have
 1796
(5.2.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I think we ought to have some reply from the Government before the Debate is adjourned. It seems to be admitted by the Attorney General that a pledge was given. To that the Attorney General assents. All he says is that in his mind there should be some very accurate distinction as to what is a defended and what an undefended case. I would reiterate the case cited by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Bridgeton Division of a man being passive.
(2.45.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : My next Amendment is consequent upon the one which has just been rejected, and, therefore, I do not move it.
 MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : I propose to insert in the Lords Amendment before the word "and," the words "but in any case where such lands have become derelict lands." The object of this Amendment is to limit the operation of the writ of  habere facias possessionem 1767
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Will the hon. and learned Gentleman read the Rules he read on the Report stage?
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I am very sorry to contradict the hon. and learned Attorney General, but I contend that there will be costs in such cases. All the initial costs of an action must be incurred before the notice of action can be filed. I should like to see the Attorney General produce an Amendment carrying out the view that where no notice of opposition is filed there shall be no costs. I want to know what has happened in another place to make the Government depart from the pledge they gave us here, and I want to see inserted in the clause some words providing that where a case is undefended, and the tithepayer is entitled to his order to recover, there shall be no costs either of solicitor or witnesses. I think that unless this is done we shall be justified, even at this period of the Session, in carrying on the fight to the bitter end. The interference of the Lords has been entirely uncalled for, and appears to have been contrary to the wishes of the Government themselves. Are the Government to throw over their pledges in this way, and to tie themselves hand and foot to any ecclesiastical or sacerdotal supporter they may have in the Upper House? It was supposed that there was to be no more contentious business in connection with this matter this Session, and many hon. Members have in consequence gone away to their homes; but I can tell the Government that if they want to facilitate the working of this Act in the Principality, they had better throw over their ecclesiastical supporters and adhere to their pledges. Unless they do so it is clear that they are simply championing the cause of the clerical tithe owner; and, speaking with a full sense of my responsibility as a Member of this House, I say I think we shall be justified in resisting the smooth working of the Act in the Principality.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Then may I ask whether if the tithe payer files a notice admitting the claim there will be no costs?
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Does the hon. and learned Gentleman say now that there are to be no costs in undefended cases?
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Then it was a peculiar thing to add words which were meaningless, and which, according to the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade, would be less efficacious now. The hon. Member for St. Pancras seems to think that the Bill will in a short time require amendment. Is not the present the time to amend it, when we point out that it is unjust, unfair, and unworkable? If more time is required to consider a more reasonable method of procedure, let the Bill stand over until after the Easter Recess, and see if you cannot adopt a more reasonable method of preserving the tithe owners' property without harsh and inequitable treatment of the tithepayer.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : The Bill does not contain the provisions you thought necessary before. If it is the law now, it was equally the law when the Amendment was proposed. It was not contended when the Bill was going through Committee that waste and improper cultivation were provided for.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : Then it is well the House should know in the future that the Attorney General is not to be held responsible for the reports of his speeches, although they are starred. At all events, he is reported to have said (Vol. 11., page 391)—
 "The words of the rules which I have read are clear, that the costs of employing a solicitor will not be allowed in any case in which no notice of defence is entered, and in cases in which there is such notice they will only be allowed for work done subsequent to such notice. Again, witnesses' costs will not be allowed in any case where the tithe payer has not given notice of defence." "I shall be glad if the Attorney General will agree to the incorporation of the rules in the Bill." "Under these circumstances I do not propose to move the remaining Amendments on the Paper." quid pro quo
(3.59.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I hope the House will give its most careful attention to this Amendment of the Lords. If it be agreed to, the effect will be that the Government will have broken the pledge they gave and receded from the promises they made both in Committee and on Report. It was agreed by the Government that in undefended cases there should be no solicitor's or witnesses' costs. The first proposal was to insert a Schedule in the Bill, and the Attorney General read out to us the Schedule he suggested. There were various Amendments on the Paper at the time, and we refrained from moving them on an undertaking being expressly given by the Attorney General not only
 1783 Hansard "There is no doubt as to the way in which costs in undefended cases ought to be dealt with, and the Government will take care that they shall be dealt with by rules of the Rule Committee. Under these rules the costs of employing a solicitor will not be allowed where no notice of defence has been given. If the tithe-payer admits that he owes the money, a rule that no costs shall be allowed beyond the fees will meet the objections that have been made. I say this with the authority of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade." "I hope that I have satisfied hon. Members that they are under a misapprehension, and that in undefended cases, the costs will be strictly limited by the rules which the Government will have framed." "It is not contended that in undefended cases,' solicitors' and barristers' costs are not now incurred; but will the hon. and learned Gentleman undertake that in such cases there shall be no legal professional costs under this Act?" 1784 "I am perfectly willing to undertake that the rules shall, in cases in which there is an admission of liability, prevent such costs being charged against the tithe payer." Hansard Hansard
(3.40.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I had not intended to intervene in this particular discussion, but the speech we have just heard calls for a few words of reply. Let me inform the hon. Member for St. Pancras, who has the impression that we may not maintain the principle for which he contends, that that is exactly what we have been doing, but we have not always found the hon. Member in the Lobby with us. A more extraordinary speech in favour of the clause than that just delivered I have never heard. First the hon. Member says he sympathises with the Government in their difficulty in dealing with the matter; then he says the procedure is cumbrous and likely to be attended with a great deal of trouble and expense. He sympathises with the Government in their difficulty, and I am sure the Government sympathise with him in his anxiety to assist the tithe owner to recover the tithe, however inequitably it may press upon the tithepayer. In dealing with this clause and the writ of possession, our anxiety is not to take away any right the tithe owner has at present, but to make it fair and equitable towards the tithepayer also. The hon. Member says the Government have had but a short space of time to deal with the matter, but, supporter of the Government as he is, he is satisfied with the clause, though he admits it is cumbrous and expensive. But what have we to do with that? We have to consider whether the clause is a proper one to pass. The Government have occupied nearly all the time since we met after the Christmas holidays with this Bill; and even with the assistance of the hon. Gentleman and his knowledge of tithe questions, the clause is cumbrous and expensive, and we say unjust to the tithepayer. But the hon.

 THE CHAIRMAN : Of course, that can be done by the withdrawal of one Motion and the substitution of another, but surely that is quite unnecessary.

 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order: That is not relevant to the matter now under discussion.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It is quite unnecessary to propose a nominal reduction unless the hon. Gentleman wishes.
(7.34.)  MR. CONTBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : In connection with the subject, I should be glad of some explanation as to the payment of night watchmen referred to on page 12, and also of labourers acting as patrols on Sundays and holidays. We have the amount set down, but the number of labourers is not given, so that we cannot ascertain at what rate payment is made. Is this extra pay or not? I cannot help suggesting to the First Commissioner, who says he has endeavoured to equalise the pay to that usual in the district, that it might be desirable to commence the equalisation with reference to the pay of higher functionaries in connection with public parks and gardens. For instance, I may draw attention to the payment of more than £2 a week to the Ranger. The question has been asked, what are the duties of the Ranger, and, until we get this explicit information, we cannot form an estimate of the value of his services as compared with the work of the labourers and others. I should like to know, therefore, that we may gauge the fairness of the rate of pay generally, what number of times in the year the Duke of Cambridge visits the park, and what is the character of the work for which he receives more than twice the amount of the pay the majority of the labourers receive for work they actually do. If the right hon. Gentleman is

It is better that the public should not have too many facilities for seeing at least one of these frescoes. The Waterloo fresco is misleading and untrue to history, as it represents what never took place. I
 1859
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! That is not pertinent to the Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! It is impossible now to go back to that item.
 DR. CLARK : I notice there has been a reduction in several items connected with the Consulates. I should
 1887
 DR. CLARK : I should also like to know whether, as you have handed the Ionian Islands over to Greece, it is not possible to transfer to that Government the duty of looking after and maintaining the cemeteries there?
 DR. CLARK : But in dealing with Greece you are dealing with a civilised Power, and surely there could be no harm in handing over the cemeteries as well as the Islands to her.
(11.45.)  DR. CLARK : On this Vote I should like to point out the desirability of steps being taken to bring all the Government Offices closer together. The present system of having them scattered all over the place is a very costly one, and it seems to me the Government might easily find, in such places, for instance, as Northumberland Avenue, sites on which Public Offices could be concentrated. Now these offices are some of them in Spring Gardens, others in Gray's Inn, and others in Queen Street. I should like to know why the First Naval Lord of the Admiralty should have an official residence when no one else in a like position has that privilege? Surely some scheme could be devised by which the present disjointed system could be abolished, and the offices concentrated in a manner which would ensure more economical working, as well as greater efficiency.
 DR. CLARK : Attention has been called to this matter year after year. Cannot someone on the Treasury Bench bring forward a scheme for securing the end which is desired by all of us? If anyone had the moral courage to propose an outlay of £500,000 it would be found to be the cheaper in the long run.
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : My hon. Friend is aware of the character of the Bill. It is practically only a Schedule which was thrown out by the Lords. England already has a Schedule.
(10.15.)  DR. CLARK : We must renew the protest we have made in the past. Something may be said on behalf of a grant for Bow Street Police Court where other than Metropolitan Police business is conducted, and I should not object to a Vote which should recognise the general business transacted by the London Police Courts, but in all this list of Police Courts in London and its suburbs, practically speaking, it is London business which is transacted. I contend that, in the circumstances, it is only right
 1876
(10.20.)  DR. CLARK : We were formerly met with the reply that the Metropolis generally had no Local Authority; but now that there is a representative County Council, I think we should lose no opportunity of pressing this question.
(5.12.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : There is a sum of £1,100 a year derived from admission fees from visitors to Holyrood Palace; and formerly fees were charged for seeing special places of interest in palaces in England, as, for instance, an extra 6d. for seeing the vinery at Hampton Court. But, so far as England is concerned, this, I understand, has been abolished; and why, I would ask, is the charge for admission maintained at Holyrood? I shall be glad if the right hon. Gentleman will explain why this should be. I suppose the only way in which we can make our protest against the continuance of the practice is to take the absurd course of moving a reduction of the Vote. But I should like to be informed whether this custom of charging for admission to Holyrood is an exception to the general practice, and why it is maintained?
(5.18.)  DR. CLARK : That is the only course, absurd one though it seems, by which we can express our disapproval of the practice. When I raised this question a few years ago it was said the charge was a small one, and a similar charge was made at the
 1833
(5.34.)  DR. CLARK : It seems to me desirable to take a Division if only to strengthen the hands of the Secretary to the Treasury and to bring the necessary pressure to bear on him. As a rule, when Scotch questions are under discussion, English Members do not attend; but to-night we have a large number of English Members present, and probably they will support us. The result of pressure of that kind being put upon the Government may be to bring about the change we desire.
(10.40.)  MR. P. STANHOPE  (Wednesbury) : I should like to call attention to the very large expenditure proposed to be made on the Consular buildings at Smyrna. There is an extremely extensive plot of laud in connection with the old Consular House in Smyrna; and I would like to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether it would not have been possible to confine the new buildings to a portion only of the land, and to sell the remainder? I do not know personally the Consul at Smyrna, but I know that Consuls in these remote places are fond of magnificent houses and are apt to send home designs of expensive Consular buildings, which, they say, are absolutely necessary for the carrying on of their duties. I do not think the duties of the Consul at Smyrna are of such a character as to require such large buildings as suggested by this Vote, and I believe the
 1879
(11.54.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : Is it proposed to continue the present temporary office for the Agricultural Department? I think a more suitable home should be found for that Department if it is to be a permanent one.
(11.38.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : May we take it there is no present intention of embarking on a considerable expenditure in building a new Consulate at Zanzibar?
(11.37.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : I see there is an item to cover the cost of enclosing certain land purchased by the Government at Zanzibar. Does that item indicate the intention of the Government to build a new Consulate there; and if the Vote is passed to-day shall we be told next year that we are committed to the policy of building there?
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : I wish to correct an answer which I gave to the hon. Member for
 1816
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : The cost will be very slight, and we do not propose to make any claim on the Egyptian Government.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : It will appear in the Expenditure of last year.
(7.33.)  MR. A. M'ARTHUR  (Leicester) : I should like to ask, also, what is the rule in regard to Sunday labour in the gardens, and whether the men are allowed any holidays, and whether the men are paid at the rate of six or seven days a week?
(5.1.)  MR. A. O'CONNOR  (Donegal, E.) : I do not wish to proceed with the discussion of this particular item, but I should like to elicit from the First Commissioner what is exactly our position in regard to these public buildings. Are we to gather that he claims the right to quarter in these public buildings the ex-Empress of the French, King Milan, or the ex-Emperor of Brazil, or any ex-Sovereign or descendant of an ex-Sovereign who may be wandering about the face of the earth? If that is the position, let us clearly understand it; but I think it will be matter of surprise to many British subjects to learn that this is so.
*(6.43.)  MR. WINTERBOTHAM  (Gloucester, Cirencester) : I agree that artisans and labourers in the country object to being called upon to pay for keeping up these London parks. It is a sore point with them that the London parks should be maintained out of the general taxation of the country. No doubt it is true that country people now and then visit the parks of London and enjoy them, but against this Londoners go into the provinces and enjoy the parks which are maintained in many cities and towns by the Local Authorities, yet these authorities do not ask the nation to contribute to the cost of keeping up their parks. I think it is only reasonable and right that London should pay for its own parks; and therefore if my
 1845
(8.19.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I understand that the right hon. Gentleman will take the suggestion I have made into consideration, and that being so, I hope my hon. and gallant Friend will not press his Amendment.
(8.11.)  MR. CONYBEARE : The right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works is quite right in the contention that it would be irrational and unfair to ask the House of Lords to permit a stream of strangers to be constantly passing through the Lobbies when they want to use them themselves. But I rise to point out that the passing of strangers through the Division Lobby of the House of
 1858
(8.25.)  MR. CONYBEARE : I should like to call the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to another matter. I see that there is an item in the Estimate for the construction of a lift in the Reporters' Gallery, and a question has been raised as to whether a lift should not be constructed for the use of the visitors to the Ladies' Gallery. I wish also to know whether the right hon. Gentleman opposite has received lately any representations as to the
 1861 grille
(9.43.)  MR. CONYBEARE : It is no doubt true that Ministers are often in attendance at the House from 3 o'clock to 1 o'clock, but at this time of the year a lamp is not lighted until, say, half-past 6. I object to the system of burning oil lamps, on account of the danger attending it. We have had a conflagration at the Palace of Westminster before now, and we may have the whole place burnt down again. We are extending the system of electric lighting, and I am glad of it. Can the right hon. Gentleman give us any idea of the length of time it will take to extend the electric light to the Committee Rooms, and to those other parts of the buildings which are usually frequented by Members? Again, I should like to know whether arrangements are made in the different rooms for switching the light on and off? [Mr. PLUNKET signified assent.] I am glad that is the case, because that must lead to a material saving.
 MR. CONYBEARE : There is a lift which is used for the taking up of coals and other articles required for indoor purposes, and anyone who has gone up and down the ladies staircase, in the well of which that lift exists, will be satisfied that there is ample room to construct one of the new elevator lifts. In the National Liberal Club, and probably in other places with which hon. Members-are acquainted, there is a small lift of the kind I have referred to. I may be told that in the case of the ladies staircase it might be necessary to sink a shaft, and that this would create a structural difficulty; but if that be so, I may remark that there are other forms of lifts which would not require the sinking of a shaft. It may also be said that the present lift is necessary for household purposes, and cannot be done away with. I do not know how that is; but, at any rate, it is not a structural difficulty such as the right hon. Gentleman has raised. I hope, therefore, that unless some very serious difficulty does exist, the right hon. Gentleman will re-consider this question, and see whether, after all, the suggestion I have made cannot be complied with.
(11.40.)  MR. CONYBEARE : On that point I should like to know, if the rooms are re-furnished every year, could not a reasonable sum be at once laid out so as to avoid these annual charges?
 MR. CONYBEARE : Is there any special reason for giving the First Naval Lord an official residence?
 MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I bog, Sir, to move that you do report Progress, and ask leave to sit again. I do not wish unnecessarily to oppose this Bill after what was said by the right hon. Gentleman the other night; and, therefore, I did not object to the Instruction carried just now.
(12.6.)  MR. CONYBEARE  (Cornwall, Camborne) : I am always loth to interfere with Scotch business, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness did not oppose the last Bill I did not venture to object to it. This Bill, however, is one which I think it very desirable to have extended to England, and I cannot allow it to pass now.
*(11.53.)  MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Member is no doubt aware that several of the Government Offices have already been concentrated, and that when the Admiralty scheme is carried out and the War Office dealt with as proposed, pretty well all that is most urgent will have been done.
 *MR. PLUNKET : Yes; it is deemed desirable, in the interests of the Department, that the First Naval Lord should be enabled to live close to the Admiralty, so as to be easily approached in case of emergency.
 *MR. PLUNKET : We are making arrangements to secure suitable offices.
*(11.50.)  MR. PLUNKET : The matter is still being considered, and no final decision has been arrived at.
 *MR. PLUNKET : It was thought advisable that we should retain the control of the cemeteries at this and other places, and I do not believe anyone would wish a different policy to be pursued.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I should not like to go so far as that. No decision has yet been arrived at. Something will have to be done towards improving the existing Consulate; but I am unable to state more than that no decision has yet been arrived at.
 *MR. PLUNKET : Land has been acquired close to the Consulate there, and it is necessary that it should be enclosed.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I would remind the hon. Member for Camborne that when the question as to constructing lifts was asked I stated that there were structural difficulties with regard to the erection of a lift for the Reporters' Gallery which will render it almost an impossibility. But with regard to the conversion of the existing coal lift into a lift for the Ladies' Gallery, that was not so much one of structural difficulty as of the very considerable
 1863
 *MR. PLUNKET : My adviser on these subjects is Mr. Taylor, the Surveyor, and hon. Members who know him will admit that there could not be a more competent officer to appeal to on these matters. He has given me the result of the calculations he has made, and I shall have great pleasure in showing his figures to the hon. and gallant Gentleman should he desire to see them. (8.34.)
 *MR. PLUNKET : I had almost hoped that during these small hours of the dinner time we might have escaped these criticisms of the hon. Member for Northampton, but the hon. Gentleman is like one of those Scriptural characters who always kept their lamps burning. But, with regard to the reduction the hon. Gentleman proposes to move——
 *MR. PLUNKET : The reduction he proposes to move if my explanation is not satisfactory, I hope I shall be enabled to relieve him from the necessity of dividing the House on this question. The fact is that hon. Members who may think the consumption of oil in these buildings is excessive and that the amount asked for is exorbitant, can
 1865 1866
*(9.29.)  MR. PLUNKET : In answer to the hon. Gentleman, I have to state that during the Easter Recess certain alterations have been successfully made in the electric light in the Reading Room, and we may have a further opportunity of improving it in the long Recess. As to the contract for oil lamps, it is not a question of middlemen at all, it is a question of economy. There is great irregularity in the number of lamps used, and it was found better to pay a certain sum for each lamp lighted. It is found it is cheaper to do this business by contract than by ourselves. At present there are large numbers of lamps always at hand, and large numbers of men always available to attend to them. If we undertook the work ourselves the staff at one time might be insufficient, and at other times more than sufficient. I can assure the Committee the matter has been gone into most carefully since the last time it was brought up, and that there is really no waste.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I have no objection to furnish a Return, giving, as nearly as we can, the number of the lamps used and the hours they burn.
*(9.46.)  MR. PLUNKET : We recognised that the light in the Reading Room was defective, and during the Easter Recess we made some endeavours to improve it. It was not possible to make it entirely successful. I hope that after the summer Recess the House will find the quality of the light has
 1870
*(9.53.)  MR. PLUNKET : As to the question raised by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Sir G. Campbell), he will see that a sum of £1,000 is included in this Estimate for the external repair of the stonework, and no doubt that part of this will be applied to the portions of the building to which he has called attention. Fresh stone has been let into the decayed spots, and the curious thing is that it has rotted in exactly the same places as before. We have had the assistance of some of the ablest authorities on the subject, and we have really not been able to account for the very partial and occasional decay of the stone. As to the staircases, that at the southern end of the Hall has been altered, but, as far as I can gather, the general opinion is not in favour of altering the one in the centre of the Hall. The contracts for furniture are in the same position as they were before; that is to say, that we have invited a large number of the best firms to tender, and we are ready, as I stated last year, to add to the list the name of any firm which any Member wishes to suggest.
*(10.1.)  MR. PLUNKET : The work as a whole has been done in a manner most creditable to the contractors, and as to the decay of the stone I have consulted the best advice I could obtain.
 *MR. PLUNKET : It seems impossible to satisfy the hon. Member, who ranges over a number of small items. A considerable saving has been effected by seeking professional assistance, and this has been secured by retaining the services of this gentleman for the fee. It is a practice which obtains and works well in many large establishments.
*(10.6.)  MR. PLUNKET : Yes, undoubtedly. The original delay was caused by the changes recommended by the Committee in 1887. New plans had then to be worked out, and afterwards some delay was caused by a re-arrangement suggested by the Admiralty. But since then we have been proceeding with the work as fast as we can. The contractors found enormous difficulty in getting a good foundation in the sand, a difficulty which, of course, would have had to be encountered whatever buildings were put on the site. But that difficulty has been overcome, and without any harm to the adjacent buildings; the foundations are now almost complete, and the building will be proceeded with, with as little delay as possible.
*(10.43.)  MR. PLUNKET : The large sums taken for Consular buildings last year, and in the present year, are principally in connection with the Corea, which has recently been opened up to our commerce. With regard to Smyrna, I have been in the Consular buildings there more than once, and I can say they are in a very bad state, owing, to a great extent, to their age and to earthquakes. It is very necessary we should have proper buildings there, owing to the fact that our trade and commerce with Smyrna have very much increased.
(10.54.)  MR. PLUNKET : The existing Agency House at Cairo is quite unfit for the purpose; and whatever may be said for the alternative plan of renting a house in European capitals, the argument has no application to an Eastern town like Cairo, where suitable houses do not exist. We have had the advantage of getting the ground and materials on very moderate terms from the Egyptian Government, and the proposed expenditure is an absolute necessity. Though £30,000 seems a considerable sum, it is not too large when the requirements of the case are taken into consideration. It will be an expenditure against which we shall have a set-off of about £600 a year, which is at present allowed to our Minister at Cairo for house rent. The political question, namely, as to whether or not we should have a Representative at Cairo at all, is one that I cannot deal with, but I would submit that if we are to have a Consul of the kind and of the importance of our present Consul at Cairo, there is no other course than that we have adopted.
*(10.34.)  MR. PLUNKET : This Vote does not, of course, bind the House to any further expenditure. It merely binds the House to pay the expenses of the competition.
*(9.37.)  MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Gentleman has truly said that the experiment of electric lighting at Bloomsbury has not been a success; and I should like to have some further experience before I make a similar experiment at the Natural History Museum. As to the item for spirits, it is for expenditure in connection with a room for storing specimens, which are preserved in spirits.
*(9.42.)  MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Member may possibly, at no distant date, have an opportunity of ascertaining that it is the unfortunate fate of a Minister to be in attendance at the House of Commons 10 hours—from 3 o'clock in the afternoon to 1 o'clock in the morning. It would not do to turn out an oil lamp every time one went from one room to another.
*(10.13.)  MR. PLUNKET : I presume other Courts are maintained by local funds; but the maintenance of the Metropolitan Police Courts is imposed on Parliament by statute, and so long as the statute remains in force, these charges must appear in the Estimates.
 *MR. PLUNKET : Not wholly expended on the foundations. The Estimate we originally took did not include the architect's remuneration; and there were works not included, as, for instance, it was found that in working out the plan decided upon a considerable space would be wasted which could be made extremely useful for stowage by the Admiralty, and for this purpose it has been made available. Further, a subway is being constructed between the two wings of the building.
*(10.10.)  MR. PLUNKET : This is not a complaint of any item in the Vote, but of the absence of an item. If the hon. Member obtains for me the consent of three parties—the Treasury, the Scotch Office, and the Local Authorities—I shall have great pleasure in proposing the Vote for the Kirkcaldy Court House, and meeting his wishes; but until then, and with no such estimate before me, it is impossible for me to deal with the subject.
 *MR. PLUNKET : What I wish the hon. Member to understand is that it is not the duty of the representative of the Scotch Office or any one else to be present and to give an explanation unless it concerns an item in the Votes.
*(10.12.)  MR. PLUNKET : If the hon. Member will put down a question on the subject my right hon. Friend no doubt will be delighted to answer it. It is unreasonable to expect the representative of the Scotch Office to be here to defend a Vote which does not appear on the Estimates.
*(8.27.)  MR. PLUNKET : With regard to the observations of the hon. Member for Northampton, I believe that very few workmen have been discharged under the new system, but the question he has put to me has come upon me for the first time. I will undertake to consider the question of the retirement of cleaners, but must refrain from pledging myself to any particular course. The construction of a lift for the use of ladies is, I understand, impracticable, owing to the great expense it would involve, and other difficulties. With respect to the  grille
*(8.22.)  MR. PLUNKET : If the hon. Member will allow me to interrupt him I can save him the trouble of saying anything further on this subject. Under a new arrangement which has just been made the wages will be paid by the Government direct to the workmen. The arrangement has been explained to many of those hon. Members who formerly urged this point, and they express themselves perfectly satisfied with it.
*(8.20.)  MR. PLUNKET : I think it is rather unreasonable to exact such a pledge from me. All I can say is that I will do what I can to bring about such a solution of the question as has been suggested.
 *MR. PLUNKET : The Conference Room is under the control of the Lord Great Chamberlain.
*(8.15.)  MR. PLUNKET : The desire of the hon. and gallant Member is that there should be access to the chamber containing the large frescoes through the Division Lobby. I should not like offhand to express my opinion as to the alternative suggested by the hon. Member for Camborne. I will communicate with the authorities of the House of Lords, with a view to see whether the suggestion can be carried out. Of course, I can give no pledge that the apartments in question will be opened at the times specified, as I have no authority in the matter.
*(8.4.)  MR. PLUNKET : I think the hon. and gallant Member has moved this reduction under some misapprehension as to the facts of the case, and that when I have explained how the matter stands he will not desire to press his Amendment. It is true that some alterations were made in the rules for the admission of strangers to the House of Lords some years ago, and I promised to put myself in communication with the officials of the House of Lords on the subject. I did so, and since the last time these Estimates were before the
 1857
*(8.19.)  MR. PLUNKET : I can give no pledge in the matter, for, as I have said, I have no authority over these apartments. I can only undertake to make a representation to the authorities of the House of Lords.
*(8.18.)  MR. PLUNKET : I am under the impression that that room is open to the public as much as possible, having regard to the purposes for which it is used. It is often occupied by the Lords' Committee on Standing Orders. However, I will investigate the matter.
*(7.41.)  MR. PLUNKET : If the hon. Member chooses to go to a Division, of course I cannot prevent him doing so. But, first, I may add something to what I have already said in answer to the questions that have been asked. I have been asked the hours of employment. At Hampton Court and at Kew, in summer the labourers' hours are from 6 to 6, with two hours off, and in winter from 8 to 4, with one hour off. They have a fortnight's holiday. As regards the park-keepers, they have a day off in return for Sunday employment. As
 1854
 *MR. PLUNKET : That is a payment to which the Ranger of Richmond Park is entitled under warrant, as all former Rangers have been.
*(7.25.)  MR. PLUNKET : It is quite true that a public meeting was held in Richmond with regard to the wages paid to the labourers employed in Kew Gardens, and as a result of that meeting a deputation did me the honour of waiting upon me a fortnight or three weeks ago. I went very carefully and fully into the details of the claims of the labourers, and I think I satisfied the deputation that, having regard to the exceptional advantages which the labourers in Kew Gardens enjoy in many ways—as regards sick pay, the attendance of medical officer gratis, pensions and other matters—so far from being ill-used or badly paid, they receive wages really above the average of those given to others in the neighbourhood. Their employment is eagerly desired by labourers.
 *MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Gentleman put down a notice with regard to the labourers at Hampton Court, and as to them I have all the details here. I cannot exactly say what the labourers at Kew Gardens receive, but I believe the minimum is 18s. a week. I am in communication with the Director at Kew as to whether some change cannot be made as to holidays and Sunday work. At the Hampton Court Pleasure Grounds one man receives 30s. a week, another receives 24s., and all the other labourers with the exception of two receive 18s., which is 1s. more than they received formerly. We compared the sums we were paying with the sums paid in corresponding employments in the neighbourhood, and we came to the conclusion that 17s. was not enough. We therefore raised the wages to 18s. It is quite true that the rate of wages paid to the labourers at Kew Gardens is not quite so high as that paid by the Corporation of Richmond, but I think I satisfied the deputation that, on the whole, the rate of wages we paid was not unreasonable.
*(7.1.)  MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Member is entirely mistaken in supposing that any part of the expense of the game that is shot by the Royal Ranger is borne by the nation. The whole of the expense, including the purchase of eggs, the rearing and feeding of the game and so on, is paid by the ranger. As to the deer, they are kept there for the enjoyment of the public and they are the only animals in the park that are paid for by the public.
*(7.4.)  MR. PLUNKET : The venison is sent to eminent men. Presents of it are made to the Lord Mayor and various officers of State such as the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary. It is necessary to kill some of the deer in order to keep them at a proper number. The lists are made up in accordance with an old custom.
*(7.15.)  MR. PLUNKET : Before we dismiss the interesting subject of the deer, I may mention that all the gentlemen who receive venison have to pay for it, and I know that a good many people, including the individual who has now the honour of addressing the Committee, have often refused to accept it, as the expense entailed in accepting it really made the game not worth the candle. However, I may say that the receipt of the venison by the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London is a privilege which they have enjoyed for 300, or 400 years.
 *MR. PLUNKET : It goes as extra receipts into the Exchequer, and is a set-off against the expenses of the park. Then I have been asked as to the plantations. I do not think anyone will contend that the plantations in Richmond Park are excessive; but, be that as it may, the plantations are not there for the sake of the game, but for the additional beauty they lend to the park. As regards Kensington Gardens, I am glad to say that
 1849
 *MR. PLUNKET : In answer to the hon. Member for Peterborough, I cannot say what the particular services of this man are: they are no doubt connected with the care of the deer. As to the opening of the road through Hyde Park, the difficulty is that if you open that road you must open the whole of the park, which would involve great expense in the way of protection.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I said the fees are not to be charged in the future.
*(5.47.)  MR. PLUNKET : The cottages occupied by the Military Knights are really almshouses. They are occupied by a number of deserving and poor Military Officers under a custom which has come down from the time of Henry VIII. This really is a good service pension, the condition of its enjoyment being, I believe, that those who occupy the houses shall go to church twice a day. As to the other cottages, they are occupied as follows: Pembroke Lodge is occupied by Lady Russell, the Thatched House by Lady Bowater, and the East Sheen Cottage by Sir Richard Owen.
*(6.0.)  MR. PLUNKET : I certainly have nothing to say against the fair and moderate way in which this Motion has been brought forward by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green. The hon. Member has confined his statement to the raising of two new points that have reference to Hampton Court Park. I would point out that the portion of Hampton Court Park to which he refers is let for a sum of £860, while the total expenses of the Park amount to £701, thus leaving a balance in favour of the Treasury. It is, therefore, not a charge upon the country. But if the hon. Member's suggestion were adopted, a certain addition to the expenses of the park would be involved, and instead of a small balance in our favour, we should have to meet an additional capital outlay of £400 or £500, as well as a new annual charge of considerable amount. That is an expenditure from which we would not shrink, however, if there were any great and serious need for throwing open the ground referred to. But hard by are the pleasure gardens of the Palace, and only on the other side of the road there is the whole extent of Bushey Park, which can be ranged from end to end. A certain portion of the residents in the neighbourhood of Kingston Bridge are to some extent inconvenienced
 1840
*(6.18.)  MR. PLUNKET : I do not think that any such application as the right hon. Gentleman has referred to has come under my notice with regard
 1842
 *MR. PLUNKET : All I can say with regard to the foals is that they are half breds, and are under the management of the Master of the Horse.
*(6.38.)  MR. PLUNKET : The hon Member has supplied the answer to his objection—namely, that an arrangement was made and accepted as a fair and reasonable compromise that parks like Victoria Park, Kennington Park, and Battersea Park, which are in no true sense Royal Parks or central in their character, or enjoyed by the general public coming from different parts of the kingdom, should be maintained by London itself. Accordingly, those parks have been handed over to the London County Council, and are now being maintained by that body. No one can contend that the parks which are still retained on the Estimates are of the same local character. Multitudes of people from all parts of England, Scotland, and Wales, indeed from all parts of the earth, visit these parks, and I believe that the people of the country, as a whole, thoroughly enjoy the great beauty and amenity of those Royal Parks, and are, in a certain sense, proud of them.
*(5.15.)  MR. PLUNKET : It may be that the attractions of Holyrood are much greater than at other places; but certainly there are a considerable number of visitors in the course of the year, and I have never heard any protest made against the payment of a fee for admission. It has never been put before me as matter of complaint. If the fee for admission is abolished, the amount derived from this source will have to be provided by an equivalent amount placed on the Estimates, and it is not usually an increase under this Vote that finds favour with hon. Members opposite. I

*(4.21.)  MR. PLUNKET : All internal repairs and alterations for the benefit of the tenant are paid for by the tenant. The only alterations included in the Vote are necessary external and structural alterations. If the arrangement is to be reconsidered the proper time will be when the whole question of the Civil List arrangement is again considered by a Committee of the House. To get rid of these charges now would be a breach of the understanding upon which the Civil List is framed. The principle of the Civil List is that certain charges were placed upon the Estimates, and the Civil List was proportionately reduced at the commencement of the reign.
*(4.24.)  MR. PLUNKET : I have explained over and over again that these expenses are not mentioned in the Civil List Act, but they are to be found in the Schedule of the Report of the Committee upon which the Civil List Act was based. The surrender of property by the Crown appears in the Act, but the conditions of the arrangement on which the Act is founded are only to be found in the Report of the Committee. It specifies what is to be placed on the Civil List and what is to be borne by the Votes of Parliament.
 *MR. PLUNKET : No; I admit nothing of the kind. I say that it does exist.
*(4.28.)  MR. PLUNKET : The hon. and learned Member for Dundee (Mr. E. Robertson) has charged me with giving up the case of a bargain. My contention is that the arrangement was a bargain so far as that word represents an obligation of honour and honesty. These houses and palaces were built or purchased at the expense of former monarchs, and were the property of the Sovereign, who had a right to dispose of them as they thought fit. A new arrangement was made by which the Civil List was reduced by more than one-half, and Parliament undertook, among other things, the maintenance and repair of the palaces, which were formerly borne by the Civil List. In answer to the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Morton), I may say that the item to which he refers applies to a number of buildings, in some of which it is necessary to have officers to take charge of them. In cases where gas is supplied to grace and favour inhabitants of these rooms, the inhabitants pay a contribution equivalent to the amount of the rates for the gas consumed.
 *MR. PLUNKET : They come under the head of extra receipts.
*(4.54.)  MR. PLUNKET : In answer to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Sir G. Campbell), I may say that the very considerable sum of £1,100 a year is paid in fees for viewing Holyrood Palace. The Committee will therefore understand that the official referred to by the hon. Member has a good deal of work to do. As to the other point raised by the hon. Member, the sum of £40 referred to was incurred in preparing the rooms and obtaining the furniture that was necessary when the assembly of the Church of Scotland was held in Holyrood Palace. As regards the speech of the hon. and
 1829
*(3.44.)  THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University : This is not the first time that the hon. Member for Northampton (Mr. Labouchere) has made an attack upon the maintenance of the Royal Palaces. He has done so every year during the present Parliament, but I am bound to say that on this occasion he has dealt much more kindly with the Vote than on former occasions. He has confined his opposition to a declaration that Kensington Palace ought to be removed altogether from the face of the earth on the ground that it is of no use, and that it disfigures Kensington Gardens. My answer to the statement of the hon. Gentleman is that the nation has taken over these palaces, and that we are under an obligation to maintain them in proper order. As to whether the Palace
 1818
 *MR. PLUNKET : No.
 *MR. PLUNKET : The hon. Gentleman is in error. It was a good many years ago—some 30 years, I think—that the Law Officers of the Crown were consulted in reference to the power to pull down a portion of one of these buildings.
*(4.10.)  MR. PLUNKET : Before the Committee go to a Vote upon the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for Northampton, I wish to explain that the sum of £425 is a gross sum asked for Kew Palace and other buildings on Kew Green. As a matter of fact, £238 is the only sum which is asked for in respect of Kew Palace, and a part of this is really a re-Vote from the Estimates of last year. All the houses on Kew Green—five or six in number—have to be supplied with new drainage, in order they may derive advantage from the new sanitary works of the Local Authority. A sum was taken last year for the purpose of connecting these houses with the new drain, and this is practically a re-Vote for the completion of the drainage works. In regard to the question of the hon. Member for Lichfield (Sir J. Swinburne), I am unable to state the precise number of acres in Kew Gardens which have been reserved for the palace, but I believe they are very few. I will, however, ascertain the exact number if the hon. Member will put a further question on the Report.
*(4.14.)  MR. PLUNKET : It is no part of my province to go into these matters, and I would remind hon. Members that these buildings are Royal Palaces or houses, and the persons residing in them are those to whom Her Majesty has assigned them. Cambridge House is occupied by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, and one of the other buildings by Lady Helps.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I am not aware at this moment; there are three others which are rather smaller.
 *MR. PLUNKET : Yes.
 *MR. PLUNKET : I hope the Committee will accept my explanation, and will not go to another Division. These buildings have always been granted by the Royal authority, and this particular portion of Kew Gardens has always been reserved, which is a very small portion of the grounds, as a lawn in front of Kew Palace. It is not at all unreasonable that the Sovereign should reserve a small portion of these grounds. All the rest has been thrown open to the public.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : Then where is it to be found? The right hon. Gentleman says it is to be found in a Schedule appended to the Report of a Committee. That is no bargain or arrangement whatever. The right hon. Gentleman does not tell the House that these so-called hereditary revenues of the Crown are in no sense the property of the Crown at all, but are public property, and are subject to all the burdens of the country.
(4.26.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON : No doubt the right hon. Gentleman has explained the matter to Parliament several times, but always in the same way. He begins by alleging that a
 1825
(4.23.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : What is the contract to which the right hon. Gentleman refers? The right hon. Gentleman misleads the House when he says that Parliament is under an obligation with regard to this expenditure. Are we to understand that these items appear in the Civil List account, and that there is a statutory obligation imposed on Parliament to bear the expense of these repairs?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I beg to ask when the names of the Labour Com missioners will be announced, together with the terms of Reference?
(5.57.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I wish to move a nominal Amendment to this Vote, in order to protest against the continued exclusion of the public from Hampton Court Park. We have in that park an area of beautifully wooded country nearly as large as Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens put together, and from that area the public are absolutely excluded, although there are a few privileged persons who are allowed, for a nominal payment, to enter when they think fit. I find we are charged £701 for the maintenance of Hampton Court Park, but there is a note appended to the Vote, stating that the extra receipts of the park are estimated at about £850 per annum. The set-off, however, is only nominal. I may mention, as a singular illustration of the growing demand for the opening of this park, that in the course of last year a large and influential meeting was held in the Mansion House to advocate
 1839
(6.12.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : I hope the Committee will not be misled by the financial aspects of the question. The facts are simply these: at present we are paying £700 a year for the up-keep of the park, while, the right hon. Gentleman states, receipts to the amount of £850 for this land throw the balance to the right side. It is simply this, that the use of this park for the use of the royal foals, is estimated at £850 a year. But I put it, whether if this park is thrown open, there is any reason to suppose that we should have to pay £850 to provide a place elsewhere for these animals. There is nothing inconsistent with the maintenance of these animals in throwing this particular park open to the public.
 MR. PICKERSGILL : Will the right hon. Gentleman state what wages they receive?
(7.22.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : I desire to ask the right hon. Gentleman what decision he has come to on a matter of some importance. I refer to the wages paid to the labourers at Hampton Court and Kew. If I am correctly informed there is here a real and substantial grievance which I am sure the Committee would desire to remedy. The case as put forward by the men themselves is this: They are receiving from the right hon. Gentleman wages which are less by 4s. a week than the wages paid to similar labourers employed by private persons in the locality. I know that the Local Authorities are thoroughly in sympathy with the men in the matter, and only a few weeks ago a very large and influential meeting was held at Richmond to support the claims of the labourers. I will not pursue the subject further now, but I should be glad to hear from the right hon. Gentleman any statement he has to make. In the meanwhile, I propose to move a nominal reduction of £100.
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I desire to do so.
(7.40.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : The right hon. Gentleman has given me a courteous, but I cannot say it is an altogether satisfactory, reply. Eighteen shillings a week is not a satisfactory remuneration, and the right hon. Gentleman admits that the Corporation of Richmond pay a higher rate. I know that the London County Council pay at a higher rate. In the circumstances, I am afraid I must put the Committee to the trouble of dividing, and in doing so I would appeal to hon. Members on both sides to recognise the extreme importance of the State, when acting as a direct employer of labour, acknowledging the fair claims of labour.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : The collision occurred through a van having been left unattended in an improper place. So far from admitting the carrier's claim to compensation, the Department considers that he ought to make good the damage done to the railway carriage.
(12.4.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : I beg to move the Amendment that stands in my name.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : The Amendment is only intended to widen the scope of the Bill with reference to charities which do not exactly come within the description of endowed schools.
(7.45.)  COLONEL HUGHES  (Woolwich) : I think that Her Majesty's Government will ultimately find that the lowest wages that should be paid by them for unskilled labour in or near London is £1 a week. It is not fair to make comparisons between the rate of wages paid in provincial towns or in agricultural districts, and that that should be adopted in the Metropolis owing to the larger amount which the London labourer has to pay for his lodging and his food. Remember, too, that many of the men have wives and families to support. I therefore trust that the Government will consent to raise the rate of wages for unskilled labour in every Department in London to a minimum of £1 a week.
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : Has the right hon. Gentleman's attention ever been called to the fact that a good deal of the decay in the stone on the face of these buildings is due to a fact which most architects ought to be able to point out in a moment, namely, that the stone is wrongly bedded. When the stone is so placed that it does not lie in its natural bed, it will almost invariably rot away in an atmosphere like that of London. I have examined a good deal of the stone in this and the adjacent buildings, and I find that in a great number of cases the stone has been face-bedded. This has, no doubt, been done in order to save expense, the pieces of stone being somewhat thin. This mistake might pass on one occasion, but I understand the right hon. Gentleman to say that he has consulted a number of architects, that a number of other
 1872
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : Is it true, as stated in the newspapers, that Mr. Davitt's name has been refused by Her Majesty's Government?
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : Then has the whole of the sum of £30,000 hitherto expended been used for the foundations, and will there be no further expenditure on that account?
(10.5.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman to explain the cause of the great delay in the execution of this work? The first Vote for building was taken three years ago, and I think it was stated then that the work would be completed in two or three years, but still there is no sign of building appearing above ground. It is
 1873
(10.31.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I see that £5,000 is included in this Vote for the extension of the buildings at South Kensington. The work will be of a very important character, and I think I am right in saying that the First Commissioner has invited competition for the design. I wish to ask whether, before the work is commenced, the right hon. Gentleman will lay the full estimate on the Table and will place the successful design in the Library? I think the House would desire to know what is really contemplated before it votes the money. I presume that the voting of this £5,000 would not bind the House to carry out work the estimate of which is not before us.
*(11.5.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : Has the building of this house at Cairo been commenced? We have previously had discussions on this subject, and again and again it has been argued that this proposed outlay is excessive and unnecessary. Last year we on this Bench in
 1883
 *MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : Has the actual building been commenced?
(6.16.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : I think the right hon. Gentleman opposite has hardly advanced a sufficient argument in answer to what has been put forward by my hon. Friend. The right hon. Gentleman is doubtless well aware that there is a great demand for good ground for cricket playing, and there has been a general impression that Hampton Court Park is one of the places where ground for that purpose might reasonably be offered. I should like to ask whether the right hon. Gentleman has not received an application from a Committee which has had this matter under consideration—that ground should be provided in Hampton Court Park for this propose? It certainly does seem to me to be very absurd that we should be using a large portion of the open ground there for the breeding of a certain number of colts when the ground might be more beneficially devoted to the use of the public.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : It is time some decision was come to.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I should like to ask whether any determination has been come to with regard to the War Office? I understood that the Committee which sat three years ago to consider the extension of the Admiralty buildings were of opinion that some measures ought to be taken to bring together all the various Departments of the War Office under one roof. What arrangements are contemplated in this respect?
(4.18.)  SIR G. TREVELYAN  (Glasgow, Bridgeton) : I should be very sorry to give a vote that would lead to the disappearance of the old Kew Palace, which is an extremely interesting historical monument, and an object of considerable architectural beauty. Nor do I object to the small area of ground reserved for the purpose of showing the palace to the best advantage. But this Vote has been challenged because it raises a principle upon which, I think, Parliament ought to pronounce an opinion. That principle I take to be this: when a private person takes a lease he undertakes certain obligations as to repair and maintenance, and the cost of structural additions to the house, which may happen in the course of the lease. I do not think it matters much what may have been done in the past. The time will come when the public will
 1824
*(6.31.)  MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg now to move the reduction of the Vote by £51,068, the charge for the maintenance of the Royal Parks. I believe there is nothing that the artisan and agricultural population of the country feel more acutely than being called upon to pay for the maintenance of the London parks. It is ridiculous to suggest that a working man in the country has any interest in keeping up, say, of Kensington Gardens. No doubt many country people visit the parks in the course of the year, and very much enjoy themselves there, but, after all, they form only a small portion of those who use the parks. Why should not London pay for its own parks? No doubt it will be remembered that when, in 1886, a similar Motion was made by my hon. Friend the senior Member for Northampton, and was carried—a Liberal Government being then in power—the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton, who was then Secretary to the Treasury, proposed, with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the parks which were not Royal Parks should be struck out of the Estimates, and that the expense of maintaining thorn should be thrown on the Metropolitan Board of
 1843
*(7.14.)  Ms. COBB : Can the right hon. Gentleman say if arrangements can be made to keep the road through the Park open all night? It would be a great convenience to a number of residents on both sides, and especially to medical men, who now have to drive a long way round. I wish also to ask whether the Bill for making a railway across Kensington Gardens has been abandoned?
*(6.44.)  MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I cannot agree with the right hon. Gentleman opposite that the nation ought to maintain the Royal Parks. I do not see how Primrose Hill is more central than Battersea Park, and if the public ought to support the former they ought equally to pay the cost of keeping up the latter. The fact is, these Royal Parks are fashionable resorts, and they are kept up for the benefit of the wealthier classes. They are but little used by the artisan classes. I certainly shall press my Motion for a reduction.
 *MR. COBB : And will the right hon. Gentleman state what chance there is of the road I spoke of being opened all night?
*(10.14.)  MR. COBB : Then may I further ask, do the Government propose to take any steps to repeal these Acts, so that while my constituents pay for the support of their own Police Courts they may not also be required to assist in the maintenance of Metropolitan Police Courts in which they are not concerned?
*(10.13.)  MR. COBB : There is an item of £23,000 for Metropolitan Police Courts. Can the right hon. Gentleman tell me out of what funds Police Courts not in the Metropolis are maintained?
*(9.50.)  MR. COBB : I should like to direct the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to defects in the system of warming some parts of the building. It seems to me that the telephone office is very insufficiently warmed in cold weather. The Private Bill Office is warmed by the introduction of hot air, and I am quite sure if the right hon. Gentleman has ever gone in there to speak to the gentlemen whose business is carried on there, he will be convinced, as I am, that the warmth of that room is not conducive to the health of those who have to pass their lives in it.
(9.41.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I will not put the Committee to the trouble of a Division, but let me say I trust the Return will explain to us the whole system. At present it seems to some of us that a Minister is regarded as a species of saint, before whom a light is to be kept constantly burning.
(9.20.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : The right hon. Gentleman has not answered the  gravamen
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Which I have already moved.
(9.7.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I wish to call attention to an item which is down on the Estimates as follows: "Supply of oil lamps for the Committee Rooms, Lobbies, Reporters' Rooms, Residences, Ventilation Department, &c, £1,900." That is the amount for the present year. Last year it was about £2,000, and £2,000 is about the average. I would point out in connection with this item that we have recently made a large expenditure in regard to the electric light, and that there is also a large expenditure for gas. For my part I do not know where all these lamps are burnt, but I do remember that three or four years ago there was a discussion on the subject, and a promise was then made that an investigation should take place. Then it appeared that there was a contract in regard to these oil lamps, and that some person got a certain sum of money each time a lamp was lit. Gentlemen who have served on Committees upstairs will probably remember occasions on which when it became a little dark an official would come in with lamps; but it being not dark enough to necessitate the use of lamps, the Chairman or someone has waved his hand and the lamps have been put out. But then these lamps had already been lit and a charge had thus been incurred. We thought that when this matter had been submitted to the House, and an assurance given that it should be taken into consideration, an end would be put to these lamps. If hon. Members will only consider what £2,000 worth of oil for these lamps really represents, they will see that it is absolutely impossible that such a sum could be expended for such a purpose in conjunction with the electric light and the gas used in these
 1864
 MR. LABOUCHERE : There is a gallery at one end of this House for ladies, and another gallery at the other end for men. Both men and women have legs by which they progress, and I want to know why on earth the women are to have a lift and the men are to have none? This is an instance of the sort of proposals that will be made in this House if ever that most nefarious and abominable proposition to give ladies seats in this Assembly is affirmed. I am, however, glad that the suggestion has been made, because it is a proof to us of what we shall have to submit to if ever we admit ladies into this House as Members.
(11.0.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : If it were intended only to expend £9,000 I should admit that that was a reasonable proposition. But I differ from the right hon. Gentleman when he supports this outlay on the ground that Cairo is an Eastern town, in which it is impossible to find a fitting residence for our Representative. I may point out that Cairo has been very much Europeanised, and there are in it many houses which, with a little expenditure, would afford ample accommodation for an English Minister. The right hon. Gentleman says that £30,000 is about the sum we ought to expend, and he has stated that we have got the site and materials for almost nothing. If that be the case, then with the money stated we shall be able to build a huge palace. Now we have at Tangier a Legation of a higher rank than that at Cairo, Tangier being, in fact, a more important place than Cairo, as the Emperor of Morocco occupies a more independent position than the Khedive of Egypt; and for the Legation at Tangier we are providing a house that is to cost £9,000, including the value of the estate; while at Cairo, on a site costing almost nothing, and with materials costing almost nothing, we are to spend £30,000 or £40,000 in building a palace out of all proportion to the relative position of the Minister who is to occupy it. What is the difference between these two Eastern towns that it should be so much more expensive to build a house in one than in the other? I think £9,000 is quite as much as ought to be expended at Cairo on this matter.
(10.45.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I wish to draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the item of £190 paid in respect of taxes for the Embassy at Berlin. Foreign Ambassadors in London pay no rates in respect of their houses, and I think there should be some reciprocity in these matters, on the principle which Prince Bismarck himself laid down. But I have risen mainly to move the reduction of the Vote by the sum of £17,000 for the purchase of a site for an Agency House at Cairo, upon which a sum of £30,000 is to be spent. We had this matter before us two or three years ago, but at that time the Vote somehow or other slipped through on the understanding that there should be a discussion at some later date. We have always on this side of the House protested against such lavish expenditure as is here indicated. I altogether disapprove of the policy of building these large houses for our Diplomatic Representatives, because they necessitate large salaries to maintain them. I have always maintained that our Diplomatic Service ought not to be paid more highly than that of America. The Americans get excellent men, good, sound, diplomatists—although not brought up to the business—for about half the price we pay for our diplomatists. I do not consider we gain anything by having Ambassadors and grandees of that sort. It was once urged by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy that Ambassadors ought to have large salaries in order that they may give good dinners to Englishmen travelling abroad—as he himself had once had a dinner with an Ambassador. I sympathise with my hon. Friend, but that is
 1880 1881
(7.47.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : From living in the neighbourhood of the park, I have had many representations made to me, and I can assure the right
 1855
(8.21.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : There has been some discussion as to a certain portion of the labourers employed in the House, and I should like the
 1860
(8.23.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : That is satisfactory, but there is another point to which I wish to draw attention. A number of the labourers have been discharged, some because they are over 60 years of age and past work, and others because they are not strong. I have been asked by some of them to bring their case before the Committee. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works is cognisant of the grievance of these men; but I must say it seems to me a strong measure—looking at the vast amount paid by this country in pensions and superannuation allowances to people in good position—that these humble persons should be sent off without pension when they reach the age of 60, or get unfit for work.
(6.55.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : This Vote includes the provision for Richmond Park. I notice that the Estimates have been so altered of late years that the persons employed practically as gamekeepers have now disappeared from them. A very large number of high officials at high salaries are employed in connection with the park. I venture to say that no nobleman would attempt to maintain a park on so extravagant a plan. The bailiff of the Royal Parks gets £700 a year, the superintendent of Richmond Park gets £250, the assistant superintendent £90; the keeper gets £259 and his deputy about £100. In fact everything is done on a grandiose scale. Now, one of the reasons for employing so many parsons is, that the shooting in Richmond Park is the perquisite of the Duke of Cambridge. His Royal Highness goes down there a certain number of times every year to shoot. Again, there are a vast number of rabbits, and the rabbit-holes are a serious danger to horse-riders. I shall not move a reduction, but I wish to point out that it would be desirable if the right hon. Gentleman could come to some arrangement with that eminent warrior the Duke of Cambridge, so that His Royal Highness may disport himself elsewhere than in a park intended for the recreation of the people. I call attention to the subject in order to give the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner (Mr. Plunket) an
 1846
(7.3.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : Will the right hon. Gentleman be good enough to say to whom these deer go? I suppose they propagate their species like other animals, and that if they were left alone they would soon grow too numerous for the limits of the park. I suppose a certain number are killed every year. Venison is a saleable article. I am told all kinds of persons receive presents of the Richmond Park venison. Will the right hon. Gentleman give us a list of these persons?
(7.5.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : We hear a great deal about the wisdom of our ancestors, but I really am beginning to think that our ancestors were the most reckless, extravagant, and silly people that could possibly have existed. It is a matter for wonder that the world went on with such people in it. Whenever we call attention to the existence of an abuse a Minister gets up and attributes it to the wisdom of our ancestors. I do not see why we should perpetuate this £100 a year for the Duke of Cambridge with the
 1847
(6.40.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : It is true that when the proposal was made to leave only the Royal Parks on the Estimates, I accepted that as a reasonable compromise. But what is a compromise? I take it it is accepting one-half of what is demanded until it is possible to get the other half. Well, I then got a half of what I wanted. I do not see that that is any reason why I should not now try to get the other half. The right hon. Gentleman says that these parks are enjoyed more by persons who live out of London than by those resident in the Metropolis. That may be the case, for the parks are a novelty to many of
 1844
(6.14.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : The argument of the right hon. Gentleman is that the letting of this particular portion of Hampton Court Park brings in a certain sum; but he might equally argue that the grazing of Hyde Park should be let for £2,000 a year. Parks are not kept for the
 1841
(11.16.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bradford stated that last year I was caught napping. I was not caught napping, but I happened to be suspended, and had I not looked on this as a personal matter, I might have pointed out that that suspension cost the country £30,000. The arguments which have been advanced by the right hon. Gentleman in support of this expenditure are those always brought forward when it is proposed to build a Minister's residence in any capital. We are always told the present house is unsatisfactory, insanitary, and too small. The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs has said that our Minister at Cairo cannot live in his present house in health and decency. What, then, have the right hon. Gentleman and Lord Salisbury been doing? Why have they not fulfilled their duties? The truth is, we know that pressure has long been put on the Government to build this house, and Lord Salisbury has proved more yielding than his predecessor.
 1885
 MR. LABOUCHERE : No, no.
(4.31.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : In referring to the basis on which the Civil List is granted, the right hon. Gentleman has started a very large subject—a subject
 1826
(5.23.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I hope the Secretary to the Treasury will have something to say upon this. I do not see any Scotch Minister on the Front Bench, and the only Cabinet Minister present is the Minister for Agriculture, who I suppose knows nothing at all of this subject. I do not quite agree with my hon. Friend that Scotchmen are exploited in these matters. On the contrary, I think Scotchmen are, as a rule, well able to take care of themselves, and get their full share of the cake. Still, I confess in this matter they have some sort of grievance. There are palaces in England into which the public are admitted without charge, and there is a palace in Scotland (Holyrood) where a fee is demanded for admission. Now, if you had a general rule for all Royal Palaces, I could understand the system, though I should regard it as a bad system, because I consider that, as the palace belongs to the nation, every taxpayer who helps to support it has a natural right of way into that palace. I need not elaborate the point; the right is recognised in England. But a charge is imposed in Scotland, and upon this I think we may fairly ask the Secretary to the Treasury, in the absence of any representative of the Scotch Department—though we do not expect him to know all about the matter—to say that he recognises it as a matter that requires consideration, and which ought to be decided in favour of the Scotch taxpayer.
(3.40.)  MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I have given notice of my intention to move the reduction of this "Vote by the sum of £1,000 in connection with Kensington Palace. Kensington Palace is a perfect white elephant; it is of no use to anybody. It was suggested some time ago that it should be converted into a species of National Gallery for the exhibition of modern pictures. At any rate, there is no necessity for keeping it up in its present condition, certain rooms being set apart in it for members of the Royal Family. When we took over the Royal Palaces, it is said that we were supposed to engage to keep them in order; but this particular palace is perfectly useless, and its sanitary condition is such that we ought to insist on its being pulled down altogether. Nevertheless, we are required to spend £2,000 or £3,000 a year upon its maintenance, and in providing it with fuel, &c. This year the sum asked for is £2,561, and last year £2,750 was expended upon it, so that on the average it costs more than £2,500 per annum, and there is not the slightest need for keeping it up. No one in London wants it, and Kensington Gardens would be better without it. I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by the sum of £1,000.
(4.2.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I have yet another appeal to make to the Committee with regard to these palaces. I will pass over the Hampton Court Stud. The Committee well knows that that is a very outrageous charge made upon us. We are called upon to pay for a stud house there, and year after year I have asked in vain what becomes of the foals. I have now given the thing up in despair, and I no longer propose to make any inquiry after these foals. We next have Bushey House, gardens and stables, and every year we nay something like £465 for keeping them up. Bushey House is occupied by the Duke De Nemours. [An hon. MEMBER: Who is he?] He is a French nobleman, son of a monarch called Louis Philippe who once reigned in France. I am not surprised that my hon. Friend does not know who he is, because he is nobody except for his birth. Why we should spend more than £400 a year in maintaining a house in Bushey Park for the Duke De Nemours, a son of Louis Philippe, and a man exceptionally rich, who I believe never resides there, I cannot understand. Then I come to Kew Palace—but if any hon. Member will go down there he will have the greatest difficulty in discovering where the palace is. My belief is that it does not exist. I have seen a gate with a small house behind it, and I believe it is called a palace; but it is a misnomer. It is a gate with a few rooms behind it. The right hon. Gentleman has told us that persons risk their lives by living in Kensington Palace, but I should like to know who the persons are who live in Kew Palace—in connection with which we are asked to lay out a sum of £425 for sanitary works, and a further sum for re-construction of the gardener's cottage, bringing the total expenditure up to £470. We are to spend this money upon a place which nobody can find out. I have asked the inhabitants over and
 1821
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Then 30 years ago we had an intelligent Minister of Public Works who did consider it un-advisable to go on wasting the public money, and because the Government were advised that they could not exercise the power as a right we have gone on spending these thousands upon thousands of pounds every year upon these useless
 1819
 MR. LABOUCHERE : The right hon. Gentleman says that he has consulted the Law Officers of the Crown as to the power of the Government to pull these buildings down.
(3.47.)  MR. LABOUCHERE : I cannot help remarking that whenever any proposal based upon common sense is made we are always told that we are under a contract to maintain these ricketty buildings. With whom did we enter into a contract? We entered into it with ourselves, and it seems absurd to hear a Minister practically admit, year after year, the necessity of getting out of the contract, and yet advise Parliament to go on spending this money.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Then I beg to give notice that I shall be under the painful necessity of moving a reduction in the noble Lord's salary.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Under what Estimate will this trifle appear? My own impression is that it has been already voted.
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : Will the Egyptian Government pay for these services?
*(11.57.)  MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : I wish to call the attention of the Government to the present state of the Ordnance Survey. The matter was brought up before the last meeting of the British Association, in an excellent paper by Mr. H. T. Crook, C.E., of Manchester, and the Association, I believe, decided to approach the Government on the subject. The matter is one of considerable importance. It must be obvious to any Member who has examined the question that many of the maps are entirely out of date. I know that in my own part of the country (Manchester) the maps are 30, 40, and 50 years old. No doubt, the Ordnance Survey there is being revised; but we shall have to wait years before we get the new maps. Again, there is no complete hill-shaded map on the 1 in. scale of either Scotland or Ireland. This is not creditable to a scientific country. At the present rate of progress, it must be 40 years before the maps can be available for the public, and by that time much of the work will have fallen out of date. The question ought to be thoroughly gone into, and sufficient
 1890
 *MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : I think the right hon. Gentleman ought to state what is done with these foals, and whether the £850 is really paid for their grazing, or what is the amount actually received for their keep.
 *MR. H. J. WILSON : I must ask the right hon. Gentleman if he can give some information about the foals?
*(9.28.)  MR. H. J. WILSON : It will be in the recollection of hon. Members that we often sat until 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, yet the cost of lighting then was the same as it is now, though we rise earlier. Another point, I think, if I remember aright the Debate of four or five years ago, some of the lamps do not belong to us but to the contractor.
(5.16.)  MR. BARCLAY : I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the attention he has promised to give to this purely Scotch subject, but I should be glad if he would carry his assurance a little further. The right hon. Gentleman says no complaints have reached him, but this is the only way in which we can complain. Of course, he never hears of the complaints made to the attendant by visitors from whom payment is demanded. I hope we may have something more definite, some explanation why a charge of this kind is made in Scotland and not in England. However flattering it may be to Scotchmen to think that their historical associations in connection with Holyrood have more interest than those of Windsor, yet that is not a sufficient explanation. I see the Secretary to the Treasury is present, and from the Treasury point of view perhaps he can give us some explanation why there should be this charge. In default of such an explanation I suppose the only way in which we can express our dissatisfaction is by moving a reduction of the Vote.
(5.35.)  MR. BARCLAY : I quite sympathise with the Secretary to the Treasury when he says that the Government are not sufficiently supported when they propose economies. But this is a question of justice as between the two countries. If the right hon. Gentleman were to propose a charge for admission to palaces in England, he being in want of revenue, I should support him; but
 1837
(5.28.)  MR. BARCLAY : I do respectfully submit that Scotch Members who have spoken are entitled to some further answer. It must be apparent to the right hon. Gentleman that there is a strong feeling on this, which may seem to him a twopenny-halfpenny matter, and I hope he will go so far as to say that the subject shall be considered with a view to the charge being abandoned.
(5.13.)  MR. BARCLAY  (Forfarshire) : I wish to support the claim that such places in Scotland should be opened free to the public as elsewhere they are. We certainly ought to have the reason, if reason there is, why an exception should be made in the case of Holyrood. The palace has much historical interest for visitors, many of whom come from across the Atlantic, and it certainly does seem a shabby thing to demand payment for seeing the interior of a Royal Palace maintained by the State. I hope the First Commissioner will give us an assurance that Holyrood shall in future be put on the same footing as other places in England in this respect.
(5.22.)  MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I think the Government will see the necessity of withdrawing this charge, in the interest of those who do not pay it, who are deterred by this fee. In Scotland there are few public buildings of this character. The people have to pay towards the support of many such in London, which they or the poorer classes among them never have an opportunity of visiting, and it is hard that when they avail themselves of excursion trains to Edinburgh they should be required to pay a fee for admission to Holyrood.
(5.33.)  MR. CALDWELL : This is clearly a Scotch, more than an English, grievance. It is true that a large number of visitors from England pay to go over Holyrood Palace, but vast numbers of Scotch people never see the inside of the building at all.
(12.5.)  THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill. The measure is much asked for in various parts of Scotland, and is substantially the one introduced some two years ago, with some alterations and improvements suggested from various quarters of the House, and especially by the hon. Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. Buchanan.)
(11.52.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS : It is very satisfactory to us to hear from the Secretary to the Treasury that steps are being taken for the concentration of our Public Offices, but I think we are entitled to further explanations on this point. What has been, or is being, done? It is admitted year after year that the present system is most costly, and that it is impossible for heads of Departments to maintain a thorough supervision of their respective branches. We know greater efficiency and economy would be secured if all the Departments were under one roof, and I therefore hope the Government will not lose sight of the importance of moving promptly in this matter.
(6.7.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : I think the statement that a new gateway into Bushey Park is to be constructed only goes to show that there is great inconvenience to one portion of the population in the neighbourhood. What we require is that the whole of this park shall be thrown open to the people. There is not. I think, an acre too much land for the growing population in that end of London, and it will be all needed to serve as a lung for that quarter of the Metropolis. I do not see why the people should be kept out of this particular park. And while I quite appreciate the advantages of Bushey Park, I do not agree that the Government have given a reason for keeping this park closed, and I hope they will cause it to be thrown open so as to be of service to this densely populated neighbourhood.
(7.30.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS : I do not think the right hon. Gentleman meed have felt very nervous in coming before Committee of Supply if he had extended his generosity a little further in regard to these labourers. I do not think criticisms from this side of the House would have been in the direction of blame for a reasonable advance in the wages paid to labourers at Hampton Court or Kew Gardens: our criticisms are generally launched at increases in salaries where such are not really required. Thus it has been this evening when we have had the Government supporting a system of indoor relief for persons who do not need it, and this stands out in strong distinction to the refusal to give better treatment to the labourers in these cases under notice. I think the right hon. Gentleman gave up the whole of his case when he admitted that the labourers under the Corporation of Richmond receive wages at a higher rate. The right hon. Gentleman says the rate of 18s. was fixed according to the standard of wages paid for similar work in the neighbourhood,
 1852
(9.38.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS : I should think the right hon. Gentleman will welcome the advent of this vote, because in the earlier part of the evening he complained of the difficulty a Minister has to make a reduction, even if he wishes to do so. He, at least, finds
 1868
(10.19.)  MR. J. ROWLANDS : Hon. Members who raise a question on this particular item must know that this is only one part of a much greater question, namely, that of the re-adjustment of the whole expenses and control in connection with the Metropolitan Police, and it can only be dealt with when that greater matter is considered by the House. The Metropolis will be quite prepared to bear its proper burdens in this matter when it has the control of the police. At present the House of Commons has the control of the police, and while that state of things lasts, of course everything in connection with the police must come before the House.
 COLONEL NOLAN : How many square yards are there?
(10.39.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I see some very large items in this Vote. I have not much objection to the Vote as a general rule, because it is usually confined to £1,000 or £2,000. That is not the case on the present occasion. £617,000 is asked for in respect of buildings in Egypt. £4,000 is to be spent on Consular buildings in Smyrna, and £2,500 on similar buildings in Tangier. I do not suppose that a house was ever built in Tangier that cost as much as £2,500.
 COLONEL NOLAN : How much?
(7.57.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I wish to move a reduction of this Vote by £2,000; and I wish it to be understood that my Amendment is exclusively directed to the House of Lords part of the building. It is in no way antagonistic to the House of Lords as a part of the Constitution; and, indeed, I am actuated rather by a Conservative than a Radical motive. The House of Lords has abrogated a privilege which Members of this House formerly enjoyed; and, to mark our sense of this, I move this reduction, the effect of which, if carried, would necessitate a more economical arrangement of matters by the House of Lords. Members of the House of Lords have been provided with some elaborately decorated rooms, some of them adorned with beautiful frescoes. Two of these are well known to the public by engravings—"Trafalgar," and the "Meeting of Wellington and Blucher." I do not in the least object to these and other frescoes being in the positions in which they are; they are beautiful works of art, whether they are in the Queen's Robing Rooms, never by any accident used by Her Majesty, or in Committee Rooms. In former times Members of this House had the privilege, with the permission of the official, of taking a constituent or a member of the outside public to see these frescoes while the House of Lords was sitting. For many years after I entered Parliament I availed myself of this privilege; but in the last four or five years the House of Lords has prevented this,
 1856 régime
(8.30.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would give me the name of the architect or engineer who has represented that there are structural difficulties in the way of the erection of a lift for the Ladies' Gallery. It is sometimes productive of good results to name gentlemen of this kind. I should, myself, think it would be possible to construct a lift which would accommodate those
 1862
 COLONEL NOLAN : I will withdraw my Motion, but I think it would be unreasonable to expect that I should not bring it up again on Report.
 COLONEL NOLAN : Does the Conference Room belong to the House of Lords?
(8.20.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I will not press the matter, but I would like it to be settled by the authorities of the House of Lords before the Report of this Vote. Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake that the Report of the Vote shall be postponed for two or three days—until he has had an interview with the proper officer of the House of Lords and is able to give an answer?
(8.7.)  COLONEL NOLAN : What I want is the re-introduction of the custom that existed for 14 years, and which enabled Members to take their constituents and friends into these two rooms. I ask this not as a right but as a privilege, which used to be conceded by the House of Lords. There is no parallel whatever between our Library and these rooms, as the latter are very highly and artistically decorated. I do not approve of the rule which prevents strangers being taken to see the Library, but that, at all events, is a room for work and not for show. The argument as to the Division Lobby does not apply to the room in which the fresco of "Moses" is placed. Privy Councillors, and the eldest sons of peers, and a large number of other people, are allowed to go through the Division Lobbies of the House of Lords at present. My contention is, I think, a very reasonable one, and I do not think the Chief Commissioner of Works has given a very good argument against it. There are many sinecure offices in the House of Lords, and I have no doubt that by calling attention to them from time to time and showing them up we shall, in the end, get what I ask for.
 MR. O. V. MORGAN  (Battersea) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether the Licensing Magistrates in the Metro-polis have power to regulate the hours at which licensed houses shall be opened and closed; and whether they can decline to renew licences unless the holders of same agree to the hours proposed by the Magistrates?
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether his attention has been drawn to the claim of Mr. F. Davey for damage done to his horse and van at Woolwich Arsenal in November last through being run into by steam engine No. 3 whilst employed in carrying iron to No. 1 repairing store; and whether it is true that compensation has been refused to Mr. Davey; and, if so, on what ground?
(4.46.)  MR. WADDY : Before we deal with the expenditure on Holy-rood Palace I should like to draw special attention to a matter relating to Bushey House. It appears to me there is a very important principle involved. A great many of us object very strongly to the indirect system of pensioning, by means of which certain persons who may be in receipt of pensions already, have subventions in the shape of being allowed to live rent free in some of these houses or palaces supposed to belong to the Crown. But however objectionable that may be in itself, we are face to face with another and greater difficulty in connection with the occupation of Bushey House by the Duc de Nemours. What is the precise amount allowed in respect of that occupation I cannot say, but I think I shall not be far from the mark if I assume that the sum of at least £200 is allotted to Bushey House. If this were a subvention given to somebody who had served this country or who was the representative of some person who had served the country I could understand it. If it were given to the widow of some great soldier or great sailor who had deserved well of the country, or if it were given to some person distinguished in science or in art, whom we wished to assist, it would be intelligible, but there is not the slightest ground or justification of any sort upon any principle for making the nation pay for this gentleman. He is the son of a deceased Sovereign of a foreign State: he is the son of the late Louis Philippe. It is notorious he is a wealthy man, and with great courtesy and earnestness I ask the First Commissioner of Works upon what ground one single penny of English money is given for the support of this gentleman? An exile from France, I dare say he deserves, and I am sure he
 1828
(4.59.)  MR. WADDY : I am bound to point out that when I state, as I do, that this is a way of giving money to the
 1830
(4.12.)  MR. WADDY  (Lincolnshire, Brigg) : The right hon. Gentleman has stated that there are five or six houses. May I ask who live in them? What are these houses? [An hon. MEMBER: Gardeners' houses.] It is suggested on the other side that they are for the gardeners. We thought they constituted some palace in which some titled people were supposed to live; but it now turns out that there is not even that excuse for keeping them up. I should certainly like to know who lives in them, and if nobody lives in them and nobody wants to live in them, why on earth should they be kept up?
 MR. WADDY : Who occupy the other cottages?
 MR. LEGH : And I am sure the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy would. The truth is that the British Representative is housed in an inadequate manner. The Representative of every other European country is enabled to make a better appearance at Cairo than our Representative, and a strong feeling is entertained that improvements in accommodation ought to have been carried out long ago.
(11.20.)  MR. LEGH  (Lancashire, S.W., Newton) : I should like to point out that the Minister's House at Cairo is extremely unsuitable for the purpose. I happened to be in Cairo last year; there were plenty of palaces which could be obtained, and I wondered why the Government had not endeavoured to get one. But when I inquired, it was pointed out that they would cost an enormous sum for repairs, and that it would be cheaper to build a new house. Any one who bas stayed in Cairo cannot refrain from coming to the conclusion that the British Representative is housed in a disgraceful manner. There is neither ample room for the accommodation of the Staff, nor for the entertainment of British subjects who may happen to be there with the object of improving their minds, or of passing the winter in Egypt for the benefit of then-health. If the hon. Member for Northampton went to Cairo, even he would expect to be entertained.
 *THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. W. H. SMITH,  Strand, Westminster : No, Sir.
 MR. W. H. SMITH : No, Sir.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : It is not usual to make a statement with regard to any particular name until it is possible to make a complete statement to the House.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope to make a statement as to the formation of the Labour Commission during the course of this week. But it is first of all necessary to submit all the Papers to Her Majesty, and that will cause some delay.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH : I hope we shall be able to reach it by an early hour on Thursday.
 *MR. W. H. SMITH  said: We shall, according to arrangement, take the appointment of the Scotch Committee on Thursday, and it was the universal understanding arrived at just before the Recess that that business would not occupy more than an hour and a half. [Sir G. CAMPBELL (Kirkcaldy, &c.): No, no.] Therefore, I hope we shall reach the Committee on the Land Purchase Bill by 6 o'clock. In any case we shall proceed with the Bill.
 *MR. W. H SMITH : I am obliged, owing to the operation of the 12 o'clock Rule, to ask the House occasionally to consider Bills of comparatively little importance first. In this instance
 1815
(5.20.)  MR. W. A. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : I am astonished that the Government should insist upon keeping up this reprehensible, this iniquitous system of making a charge for admission. If we go to Paris and other continental cities, we find the public are admitted to such places free of charge, and the same thing can be said of palaces in England. But Holyrood is selected as an exhibition from which the Exchequer derives this income! It is the very height of meanness, for while we in Scotland are called upon to pay more than our fair share for items under this Vote, the people of Scotland are required to still further pay to see their own property. I hope we may have from the Government a categorical and explicit promise that this shall be put an end to. The subject has not been presented to the right hon. Gentleman before, but it is one that should only require to be mentioned.
(5.30.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N : I hope it will not be thought that I desired to shirk any responsibility; but the fact is, my right hon. Friend (Mr. Plunket) is in charge of the Vote, and as I regard him as perfectly competent to deal with the matter, I have not thought it necessary to remain in the House during the whole of the Debate. I do not think
 1836
 MR. JACKSON : There is great force in what the hon. Member says.
 1888
*(5.25.)  MR. MORTON : I imagine that this 1s. charge which goes to make up the £1,100 is not borne mainly by the Scottish people, but is paid by English and other visitors. This, however, is no reason why the charge should be made, and it is manifestly
 1835
*(5.2.)  MR. MORTON : I quite agree with the hon. Member it is an extraordinary thing if we are to understand that British taxpayers are to maintain these buildings that they may be tenanted by any runaway King, Prince, or President in all the world. If we have nothing to say as to who shall occupy these buildings, I think, at least, we may claim that whoever does occupy them shall relieve us from the cost of keeping the buildings in repair. Then I should like to have some information about these Military Knights at Windsor Castle——
*(4.53.)  MR. MORTON : I shall be glad when the right hon. Gentleman replies to the hon. and learned Member below me if he will also tell us who are the "military Knights" who occupy houses at Windsor Castle? £335 appears to be spent upon them. I daresay it may be all right, but I think we are entitled to the information. I will, however, allow the hon. and learned Member's question to be dealt with first.
*(4.27.)  MR. MORTON : I must press for an answer to my question about the charges for fuel, light, water, household articles, and tithes. Do any of those charges apply to the little cottages he has referred to?
 *MR. MORTON : May I ask where we shall find the account of the receipts for gas and other things?
*(4.16.)  MR. MORTON : I understand that the cottages are occupied by certain persons during the pleasure of Her Majesty, and I am not going to dispute her rights. But we are told in the Votes that the country pays for light, fuel, water, and household articles. Surely it is not the business of the taxpayers of the country to supply light, water, fuel, and household articles to people who can well afford to pay for them themselves. There is also, I believe, a sum for tithes. I should have thought that members of the Royal Family would be the first to pay for tithes, and not call on the country to pay them. That is an item which certainly cannot be charged for the purpose of keeping the buildings in repair externally, and that is the only duty the right hon. Gentleman tells us the nation undertakes.
*(4.13.)  MR. MORTON : I also should like to know who live in these cottages, and particularly who lives in Cambridge Cottage, in regard to which I see there is an item in the Vote for reconstruction. I think that persons who are in the receipt of large incomes ought not to be in this way a charge upon the State. Cambridge House appears to be a place of some magnitude, seeing that it has a gardener's cottage and grounds attached to it.
*(3.51.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : We are not criticising the expenditure with regard to palaces occupied or partly occupied by Her Majesty, but buildings which are altogether in a different position. As I understand the right hon. Gentleman, it is only the Law Officers of the Crown who are against him. But the Government are not the House of Commons although they may have a majority with them sometimes. Surely the object of putting this expenditure into the Estimates at all is to enable us to consider whether it is worth while to go on with it and to continue paying these excessive sums year after year. I can easily understand that we are under some sort of contract with regard to the Royal Family and their friends, but I think we have a right to reduce some of these charges seeing that we have increased many of the allowances to the Royal Family. No complaint can reasonably be made against us if we desire to economise in reference to the expenditure upon these old and useless buildings. If they are to be maintained, they ought, at any rate, to be devoted to some useful purpose. In this particular case I think it would be of advantage to the British public to remove these buildings altogether and throw the ground upon which they stand into Kensington
 1820
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether with regard to buying out the French Treaty rights on the West Coast of Newfoundland any communication, either in writing or verbally, has been received from the French Government with regard to our occupation of Egypt?
*(11.22.)  MR. MORTON : I understand the hon. Member who last spoke to argue that the house ought to be built so that the British aristocracy may be properly entertained by our Minister at Cairo. Did the hon. Member say that on behalf of the Government? Again, if £69,000 is sufficient for a house at Tangier, why is it not enough for one at Cairo? The First Commissioner has told us that there may be a political side to this question. We have been holding-out to the Trench people a hope that we are going to give up our military occupation of Egypt. Yet, now the Government are going to put a big building there, and the Under Secretary for
 1886
 *MR. MORTON : In conclusion, then, I can only say I trust the House will consent to reduce this item, on the ground that such an excessive outlay ought not to be thrown on the taxpayers of this country.
*(11.36.)  MR. MORTON : I now wish to ask as to the State Taxes at Berlin.
*(5.46.)  MR. MORTON : I should like to know who are the "Military Knights" who are stated in the Estimate to occupy houses at Windsor Castle? I would also ask who are the persons who occupy the other buildings: Pembroke Lodge, The Thatched House, East Sheen Cottage, Hawthorne Lodge, Hawthorne Cottage, and the cottages in Bushey Park? Without this information we have no means of forming an opinion as to whether or not this Vote should be allowed.
*(5.49.)  MR. MORTON : I do not object to the Military Knight business now I know what it means; but I
 1838
 Mr. MORTON  was appointed a Teller for the Ayes; but no Member being willing to act as second Teller, the Chairman declared that the Noes had it.
*(7.10.)  MR. MORTON : I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would explain why the Lord Mayor of London gets this deer. [ Cries of 1848
 *MR. MORTON : I am not on the fees now. I am asking for an explanation of the payment to the Duke of Cambridge as Ranger.
*(7.21.)  MR. MORTON : I want to know what services the Duke of Cambridge, the Ranger of Richmond and other Parks, performs for £109 10s.
*(7.20.)  MR. MORTON : The right hon. Gentleman misunderstands my question. I asked what duties the Hanger performs for the £109 10s. which he receives?
 *MR. MORTON : Who gets the money?
*(9.40)  MR. MORTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman say whether the contract is ever renewed; whether, at any time, persons other than the present contractors have had an opportunity of tendering for the work? I trust, too, that the Return which the right hon. Gentleman has promised will show us how the money is spent. Perhaps the First Commissioner would allow us to see the bills sent in.
*(9.51.)  MR. MORTON : I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman one or two questions. I see that there is a "house allowance" of £54 4s. to the Clerk of the Works. Why is not that included in his salary, as it is really part of his salary? Then there is an allowance of £100 to the Resident Engineer. Of course, that is practically an increase
 1871
*(9.56.)  MR. MORTON : As to the £100 allowed to the engineer?
 *MR. MORTON : And as to the item of £100 for a Resident Engineer?
*(10.17.)  MR. MORTON : I think we may well demand some explanation of the existing state of things. We must, of course, stand by Acts of Parliament; but if they operate unfairly they should be altered, and it is manifestly unfair that the rest of the country should be called upon to pay for its own Police Courts and for those of London as well. I know the reply from the Metropolitan ratepayers is, you will not give us the control of our police, and so you must undertake the expenditure with the management. But this does not satisfy the rest of the ratepayers in the country, who from their rates support their own police and Police Courts. I do not suppose the Government will undertake to-night to make any alteration, but I think the time has arrived when Government should seriously take this question in hand.
(9.45.)  DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : Can the right hon. Gentleman give us any indication when we shall find ourselves in possession of an electric light by which we shall be able to read? I have heard innumerable complaints as to the very defective nature of the electric light supplied in various rooms in the building. No doubt it is only a matter of arrangement; possibly the substitution of 32 candle lamps for 16 candle lamps. From what I hear, and also judging from my own experience, the electric light is not by any means so pleasant as gas light. We have got rid of the heat, but we lack the light.
 MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : Will the Savings Banks Bill be taken to-night?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Then I will ask the right hon. Gentleman to state all the information he is prepared to give.
(3.50.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy, &c.) : As to the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, I should like to understand what the real situation is. Does the right hon. Gentleman mean us to understand that Parliament as against the Crown cannot deal with this public property? There can be little doubt that if we were to approach the Crown in a becoming manner, the Crown would not be so unreasonable as to resist the desire of Parliament to get rid of this extravagant expenditure.
(4.11.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I should be glad to learn the exact number of acres reserved for Kew Palace, but there is something more I want to ascertain, namely, why they are not open to the public. The Palace is certainly a very gloomy one, and I cannot imagine a more serious punishment than being shut up in it. If no one resides there,
 1822
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I must protest against the manner in which the Government bring forward Votes of this
 1823
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Are we to understand that the Duke of Cambridge lives there in any part of the year?
(4.44.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : As long as there are palaces in England I am not going to object to there being palaces in Scotland; but there are one or two items relating to Holy-rood Palace in regard to which I should like explanation. I notice that £32 is paid to the issuer of tickets of admission. The porter at the palace is provided with house and receives a salary, and I imagine he is the person who is paid the £32. Are these tickets issued gratis, and is the porter prohibited from taking "tips" for issuing them? I have never gone inside Holyrood Palace, but I think it is desirable that if we pay the porter, the public should be admitted free; and I am anxious to know whether they are admitted free or not. Then I notice an allowance of £40 to the High Commissioner of the Church of Scotland for expenses attending the occupation of rooms in the palace. That seems a rather unnecessary ecclesiastical expense. It is generally considered a
 1827
(4.58.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I will not pursue the subject of the amount paid for the Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Considering that we have a Church of Scotland, perhaps a High Commissioner is passing cheap at £40 a year. I think, however, the right hon. Gentleman's reply with regard to Holyrood Palace discloses a Scottish grievance I have never heard that the country makes a profit by charging fees of admission to Royal Palaces. I have been to Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle, but cannot remember that I was charged a fee. Yet the right hon. Gentleman says the people of Scotland are charged £1,100 a year for viewing our one little Palace of Holyrood. It seems to me that this is a real Scottish grievance, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will cease to make money out of the one Royal Palace which is kept up in Scotland.
(5.15.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : The right hon. Gentleman does not fully represent the matter when he says the abolition of the entrance fees means adding an equal sum to the Estimates. We are now asked to vote a sum of £32 for the man who issues the tickets, and the sum of £1,100 is subtracted from the Estimates, and thus the Imperial Treasury is benefited by a sum of money derived from a purely Scottish source. I am a thorough Scotchman, I hope a typical Scotchman. For some 60 years I have constantly passed Holyrood Palace, and I did not quite remember why it was I never have seen the inside. Now I know it is because admission is refused unless by payment of 1s. Now I do not think a Scotchman ought to be required to pay 1s. to see the ancient palace of the Kings of his country.
(5.26.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I see the Secretary to the Treasury has fled from the appeals made to him. I will not accuse the Members of the Government of a conspiracy of silence. Certainly there is something very like it, but I will not attribute such a motive to them. I believe the truth is, they know nothing about this matter. There is an exemplification this evening of the evil habit of bringing forward Scotch questions on the first day of meeting after the holidays when few Scotch Members are present. In the same way the proposal for the Committee on the Scotch Private Bill Procedure Bill was thrust upon us just as we were rising for the holidays. You dare not bring forward Irish Votes under such circumstances. We have not any Member of the Government representing Scotland present. I understand that the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner has given some sort of promise in a jocose manner, but I think we ought to have a pledge that this matter shall be seriously considered.
(5.36.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I hope that what has fallen from the Secretary to the Treasury may he taken as amounting to a serious promise. I would point out that when strangers—Englishmen and Americans—visit Scotland they do not understand the financial arrangements between the two countries, and look upon the Scotch as a stingy people, charging 1s. in Scotland for a privilege which in England is granted for nothing.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg to ask the representative of the India Office whether he can give the House any further information with regard to the disaster at Manipur? Are we to understand that the Sepoys have reached their destination in safety as well as the British force?
(9.47.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I desire to make a few remarks in regard to Westminster Hall. I very much regret to notice that there is no Vote for the restoration of Westminster Hall. I had hoped the right hon. Gentleman would ask for a moderate sum to restore the Hall by removing those abominable and disfiguring abortions which have recently been introduced. I certainly think it is necessary something should be done to restore the exterior stonework, which during the year has been reduced to a condition similar to a very irregular chess-board. At present the exterior presents the appearance of a piece of patchwork of sound and unsound stone. I know some people put the blame upon the Board of Works of William Rufus. No one can possibly believe that. It is quite clear that if the builders of William Rufus had used bad stone, Westminster Hall would not have lasted as long as it has. Does the First Commissioner of Works propose to make any provision for restoring the outside of the Hall, and will he also say when the public are to be re-admitted to the Hall?
(10.0.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : My hon. Friend, who is a practical man, has probably suggested the proper explanation, that the rotting away of the stone is due to a want of elementary knowledge of the stone-building craft. Such a thing should never exist in connection with a great national building, however we may expect it in the shoddy building of the ordinary builder. I hope the right hon. Gentleman has been careful to get the opinion of a practical man wholly independent of the actual contractors.
(9.25.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I think the right hon. Gentleman's reference to the lamps of my hon. Friend as always burning is rather out of place, because his complaint is that the lamp is not always burning. I agree with him that in this House we ought to show an example of economy. For warming and lighting this building, large though it is, £15,100 does seem an enormous expenditure. It is perfectly true that the electric light is a good deal more expensive than gas and oil, still the electric
 1867
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : There are many Scotch item? in these Estimates, and I shall move to report Progress if the representative of the Scotch Office does not appear.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Yes, but after the processes gone through we naturally expected to find the item in the Votes. The demand is urgent, and I want to know why it is we are to wait another year. It seems to me the representative of the Scotch Office should be in his place to answer questions of this kind; he appears in support of the Government at every Division.
(10.11.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : There is no doubt whatever about the assent of the Local Authority the Fife County Council, and we understood that the Treasury had assented. In fact, I do not think the Scotch Office would have gone so far as it did go in the selection of a site unless the sanction of the Treasury had been obtained. I am not surprised that the right hon. Gentleman himself should know nothing of the question, but why is not the representative of the Scotch Department present? He might give us some information, and it might be desirable to make a Motion to report Progress to enable him to attend, for I believe he is somewhere about the building.
(10.9.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : It will be in the recollection of the right hon. Gentleman that a couple of years ago I brought to the notice of the Government the need of a Court House at Kirkcaldy, and strong representations were made in the same direction by the Local Authorities. In the result the suggestion was favourably received by Her Majesty's Government, and the Secretary of State sent an agent to inquire into the matter, and I imagine the Government were satisfied that the need existed. The County Council of Fife have agreed to pay their share of the cost, and I thought the whole thing was settled; but, looking over the Vote, I find no provision made for this Court House, which I believe has been sanctioned. I hope the right hon. Gentleman, in the absence of any Scotch Representative of the Government, will be able to explain how this is.
(10.35.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I was aware that the Natural History Museum began with the very earliest geological period, and went up to the latest developments of Nature; but I was not aware until I looked at the Votes that there was a "collection of spirits" there. I should like some explanation on that point. I should also like to hear something on the question of electric lighting in the Natural History Museum. The Government were at one time almost persuaded that the electric light was required for that museum; but, unfortunately, they were induced to think that the Bloomsbury Museum ought first to be supplied with it. Things have turned out as I predicted at the time. The British Museum at Bloomsbury is not of a popular character, and is not likely to attract people in search of light amusement in the evening. The experiment has been a failure at Bloomsbury, and I want to know whether the right hon. Gentleman will not repeat it under the much more favourable circumstances existing at the Natural History Museum, which is an institution of a much more popular and attractive character.
(10.57.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I can testify to the insufficient and unhealthy nature of the existing buildings, but I think the proposed expenditure is greater than is necessary for our permanent wants. Doubtless Cairo is different to a European capital, whore you have a choice of good houses ready to your hand. In Cairo you have not a large choice, and the best proof of the necessity that exists for a new building is the fact that the family of the Consul General suffered seriously from illness through the insanitary condition of the present house. Cairo is altogether an unhealthy town, owing to the fact that the Octroi Duty, which should be expended in the improvement of its sanitary condition, is grabbed for the purpose of paying the
 1882
(7.9.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : With regard to the rabbits, on all well-ordered estates an attempt is made to get rid of them, and I think Her Majesty's representatives in the park ought to try and get rid of them too. I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he can give us any information on the vexed question of the mortality among the trees? Has it been stopped, or is it still going on?
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : There are 13,000 square metrès. The Egyptian Government accepted 4f instead of 6f., which caused a reduction in the price of £1,000. Beyond all controversy that price for the land is very low. At present the house occupied by the Consul General is held from year to year. He may be turned out at any moment, and, if he were to leave, Sir Evelyn Baring does not know of any other house in which he could accommodate himself. He has himself been put to considerable expense to maintain the house which he occupies, and his family have suffered from its extremely insanitary condition. The sum asked for will provide a sufficient and proper building for the Representative of this country. We must always have there an officer of considerable rank, and this house will be by no means too large or the cost extravagant, considering the climate and the requirements of the Mission which our Representative fills. I may point out that other Powers have not considered similar outlays excessive. The French Government have expended a large sum in a like manner at Cairo. Even if our present relations with Egypt alter, we must always have a Representative there.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : Yes, and considerable work has been done. The Committee will remember that some years ago a sum of £500 was voted for preliminary expenses connected with the providing of a new Consular residence at Cairo. For many years this matter has been strongly pressed on the Government, and the Foreign Office have been convinced that health and decency rendered it absolutely necessary to provide a new residence. If hon. Members were only aware of the state of things now existing, they would admit at once that this expenditure was absolutely necessary. In comparing Cairo with Tangier it should be remembered that at Cairo the value of land is higher and building far more costly; and at Cairo the Agency is one of very great importance. Probably there are few Missions of greater importance. A large staff must be accommodated there. The site we have secured is an extremely eligible one. The price was originally at the rate of 6f. the square mètre.
*(11.9.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : The work has been already commenced, and an expenditure of £9,000 incurred.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : Thinking it probable that a question might be asked I inquired at, the India Office, and was informed that all the information possessed by the Secretary of State on this subject had been forwarded to the newspapers, consequently I am not able to add anything. If, however, the House wishes to know anything as to the cause of the affair I can give it, but only in a brief form.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I may say, very shortly, that the affair at Manipur was caused entirely by domestic differences between the Maharajah and his brother, and the former, being alarmed for his safety, took refuge in the Residency. He subsequently abdicated, and retired from the territory of the State, leaving affairs in a condition in which they could not be allowed by the Government of India to allow them to remain. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Assam went up to take the necessary measures, and met with resistance from the brother of the Maharajah, who was the commander of the troops, which led to a deplorable reverse and loss of life. Of course, active measures have been taken to restore order and to place the Government of the State on a secure footing. A Despatch from the Government of India has been received on the subject, and will shortly be laid on the Table.
*(4.9.)  SIR J. SWINBURNE  (Staffordshire, Lichfield) : May I ask how many acres there are in Kew Gardens surrounding this so-called palace from which the public are shut out? I believe that there is a large acreage surrounding it at one end of the gardens from which the public are entirely excluded. I should like to know what the acreage is.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight : Yes, Sir. Except in the case of occasional licences where the Magistrates have no discretion. The hours are fixed by Act of Parliament.
 MR. LEA : Will the Land Purchase Bill be the second Order of the Day for Thursday?
 MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury when the Land Purchase Bill will be taken?
(1.32.)  SIR J. COLOMB  (Tower Hamlets, Bow,  : We have had sad experience in former years of relief of distress in Ireland, but the work of the present Administration, under the Vote the Committee are now considering, is the most successful effort I have known to deal with the temporary difficulty in a common-sense and practical way. I can endorse much that has fallen from the hon. and learned Member for North Longford, and I trust the Chief Secretary will turn his attention to the necessity of establishing on a wider basis some sort of Agricultural Teaching Department in Ireland. I much fear, as the hon. and learned Member has stated, that the periodical necessity of providing funds to supply the Irish peasants in the West with potato seed has become almost a regular part of the machinery of the

(1.38.)  MR. FLTNN  (Cork, N.) : The harrowing picture drawn by the hon. and gallant Member who has just spoken, if it is correct, only shows the deplorable results of the last 90 years' supervision of Ireland by the Imperial Parliament, and furnishes the strongest possible argument why the Irish people should be left to govern themselves. But I traverse the statements of the hon. and gallant Member; they are gross exaggera-
 19 20
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! I hope the hon. Member will kindly keep a little to the Vote.
(5.15.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by £1,000, in connection with the Salaries and Expenses of the Public Prosecutor.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member must vary the amount; £100 has already been rejected.
 DR. TANNER : I have always great pleasure in assisting at the reduction of any legal Vote. I am altogether of opinion that lawyers get too much, and I think the point has been so ably and lucidly put by my hon. Friend that it will commend itself to the majority of the Committee. I do hope the Committee will be saved the trouble of dividing by the Solicitor General giving us a straightforward and satisfactory answer, and so remove the suspicion which is in my mind as well as in the mind of my hon. Friend, that the law is not administered alike to rich and poor.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co, Mid.) : I should be glad if the right hon. Gentle-

*(1.23.)  MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : I congratulate the Chief Secretary upon his changed demeanour on this question of relief, and I think we may date that change from the time of his visit to the West of Ireland, when he saw with his own eyes the real necessities of the situation. We have had remarkable testimony to-day to the honest intentions of the poor people on the islands, and I think the Committee must have been impressed with the facts given, for these are the districts where, during the late agitations, the people were said to be the most disaffected, and animated only by the desire to rob and defraud. We have seen how, unbound by other than moral obligation, they have loyally repaid the advances made to them; and this experience is only in accordance with what we have had in land purchase transactions, in relation to which only an exceedingly small amount of arrears remain outstanding. My ex-

 *MR. WEBB : On what basis did the Government go in deciding what roads should be constructed?
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : In starting relief works the Government looked rather to the necessities of the people than to the demand for roads.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : If the hon Member for Longford had been in the House when the adjournment of the House was moved in connection with the subject of distress in Donegal, he would have been convinced that the Government have taken immense pains to satisfy themselves on that subject, and I can assure the hon. Member that the trouble they have taken in the past they will continue to exercise in the future.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Yes.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I offered a stone of meal; and it must be remembered that subsequently the price of meal rose, so that the relief became equal to 7s. a week.
(2.55.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : With regard to the questions that have been put to me in reference to the roads which are being made I would refer hon. Member to a Return which was published on the 28th of February this year, and which contains a list of all the works, which are fully described, together with many important details. I will see that that Return is continued down to the present time, and that will probably give the information desired. With regard to the remuneration of the police engaged in the superintendence of relief works, they only get 6d. a day extra for the work of supervision, and whatever else they get is in accordance with the ordinary rules of the force when men are required to serve out of their own districts. As to the number of persons employed on relief works, I find that in Donegal on June 20 the number was 775; in Mayo, 5,725; in Galway, 4,771; and in Cork, 2,454. The hon. Member for Galway (Colonel Nolan) has criticised what has been done in that county. He has complained that relief works were not started in the eastern part of Galway, but the fact is no less than three relief works were started and had to be abandoned because the wages were not sufficient to induce the population to seek employment upon the works. Yet the wages offered—2s. a day—were more than double the

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I will obtain that information, but I have not as yet had it worked out for all the districts. The paper I have before me gives an abstract of the work done in each county, but does not specify the particular districts. The total number of labourers employed—including men, women, and boys—was on the 28th of February 6,812; on the 28th of March, 7,767; on the 25th of April, 11,600; on the 23rd of May, 14,000; on the 20th of June, 13,000; and on the 11th of July the number had fallen to 11,000. Of course this number is vapidly diminishing, and

 MR. A. O'CONNOR  (Donegal, E.) : I desire to ask the Solicitor General a question with regard to the intentions of the Government as to the interest which certain Magistrates' clerks have in prosecutions. There is a statute providing that the clerks in boroughs shall not be interested in the prosecutions. That rule does not prevail in country districts, and the consequence is that there are many Magistrates' clerks who have a direct pecuniary interest in committals. It has been admitted by successive Governments that this is a blot on the administration of justice.
 *MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH  (Inverness-shire) : I wish to say, with regard to this Vote, that there are large districts in Scotland, especially in the Western Highlands and Islands, which equally require development with Irish districts, and the people there rely that at the proper time the Government will deal with them in the liberal spirit which has characterised their treatment of the Irish.
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I wish to point out that in this matter the Board of Works are endeavouring to levy a charge on lands which have not been benefited at all. There are no works at all done on one of the tributaries of the Erne, but the tax is to be levied on the lands through which it passes.
 MR. KNOX : Will the right hon. Gentleman lay on the Table papers relating to this matter?
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not take the Vote for the Supreme Court of Judicature.
*(4.55.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I think the strongest argument of the Home Secretary was that it would be impossible to have an effective advocate in the Attorney General unless he was in daily contact with the Courts. The right hon. Gentleman somewhat exaggerated that argument, but no doubt there is considerable force in it. On the other hand, the right hon. Gentleman appears to understate the amount of business which would still be conducted in the Courts by the Attorney General if the Motion were adopted. At present the Attorney

 MR. GOSCHEN : If the Motion is withdrawn the Government will stop at the Vote before the Committee.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I would appeal to the Committee to take two or three more Votes.
*(4.12.)  MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : I think my hon. friend has done good service by his Motion, both to the public and to the Bar. The Attorney Greneral and the Solicitor General are the servants of the Crown, and in that sense servants of the public and of this House in exactly the same way as any other Minister, and I fail to see why an exception should be made in their favour. A few years ago there was a discussion in this House in reference to the Judge Advocate General taking business on behalf of a Foreign Ruler—I do not want to go into it—but the course followed was not received with favour by this House. I believe there is not a single other country in the world in which the Law Advisers of the State are allowed to take private practice, and there are sufficient reasons why the Attorney and Solicitor General should come under the general rule. In no case should private interest be allowed to conflict with public duty. My hon. Friend has pointed out two occasions in which most awkward complications have arisen under the present system. I quite agree that this House has in a sense the right and the attendance of one or other of the Law Advisers of the Crown and Parliament, and speaking from my experience as Chairman of a Grand Committee I can say that more than once we have felt the inconvenience of not having one of the Law Officers present to give an opinion upon some legal question which has turned up. The objections raised are not valid. It is said we shall not get the best man, but all I can say is, if men are so wedded to the desire to the making of money that they will not give their entire services to the public for £12,000 a year then the less we have to do with these men the better. As a matter of fact, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bury and

 *MR. MATTHEWS : I will come to that in a moment. I am now only supporting the assertion that the position of Attorney General is a precarious one. I have not taken out of this list the number of those who during those 56 years became Judges, but certainly I say that the tenure of the office of Law Adviser to the Crown is not the best and surest road to the Judicial Bench. At present there are the Lord Chancellor and 33 Judges on the Bench, yet of these only three have ever been a Law Officer, namely, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Master of the Rolls. The position of Law Officer, therefore, is precarious, and it is by no means a certain road to the Bench. Are we likely to get the best men at the Bar to accept the position if they are to be entirely debarred from private practice? Would this be advantageous in the public interest? In a country like this of Judge-made law it is very necessary

*(4.23.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : I hope the Committee will allow me to occupy their attention for a very few minutes whilst I lay before them the views which are entertained by those sitting on the Treasury Bench on this subject. I do not share the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport in relation to fees for contentious business. The present

 *MR. MATTHEWS : I cannot see any distinction in point of principle between the two Law Officers of the Crown. Certainly the arguments of the hon. Member apply equally to both the Law Officers of the Crown. During the 56 years ending in 1886 there were 33 changes in the office of the Attorney General, giving an average tenure of that office of 20 months, while during the same period there were 40 changes in the office of Solicitor General, giving an average tenure of that office of 16 months.
*(5.54.)  MR. MATTHEWS : I hope the hon. Member will not think me discourteous if I decline to follow him into the details of the cases he has referred to. If he had pointed out any misconduct on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I should have been prepared to defend an officer who has discharged his duty with rare zeal and ability. The system of private prosecution does not come within this Vote, and I decline, therefore, to enter into a discussion as to whether the English system of leaving persons aggrieved to prosecute is inferior to that of other countries. The single matter in which the remarks of the hon. Gentleman were relevant is the question of whether it ought to be part of the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute the promoters of fraudulent public companies. Public frauds always have been and are still prosecuted by that official, but the sort of frauds which are not so prosecuted are those in which a set of rogues and knaves put forward a number of false and fraudulent state-
 56
(1.48.)  MR. RENTOUL  (Down, E.) : The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for North Longford began his remarks by a reference to County Donegal, of which I am a native and in which I lived 20 years. I know a good deal of the county, and during the last 12 months I have been in each of the four districts of the county. I found that the county was, during the last winter, in a greater state of prosperity than at other times when there was talk of distress. The people were in a greater state of satisfaction with their surroundings than I have ever known them to be in their history. If a less amount of relief were given it was because a less amount was needed. The amount of money given to the clergy has been referred to. That is always considered an infallible test of the condition of the people. The Presbyterian Church is very strong in Donegal, a full and complete financial report is published by it every year, and it is always considered that the prosperity of the county can be estimated by that report. As contributions to the churches go up or down, so does the prosperity of the people. It is natural that it should be so, because when the people have bad years they cannot be expected to contribute to the support of their clergy or their religion at the same rate as in prosperous years. If the people are living below their ordinary income, the clergy will naturally do the same thing. I am sure the Catholic clergy, many of

 *MR. JORDAN : Yes, Mr. Courtney, I will do so. I was only saying that these people waited on the Lord Lieutenant in reference to the construction of a pier at Redgap and a pier at Liscanor, which could be used by the two English Companies for the shipment of the stone flags from the quarries in the neighbourhood, whereby work would be found for 400 or 500 men at an outlay of from £30,000 to £40,000 a year. If the Harbour of Liscanor were deepened, I am told that 1,200 tons of flags per week

*(2.24.)  MR. JORDAN  (Clare, W.) : I cannot undertake to settle the question between the hon. Member for East Down (Mr. Rentoul), and the hon. Member for Longford (Mr. T. Healy) as to whether the Church is a financial barometer, but I know the clergy, to whatever denomination they belong, are all anxious to get the loaves and fishes. Considering the appalling distress that was anticipated during last August, and the great difficulties he had to encounter, I think, on the whole, the statement made this evening is rather satisfactory. As far as I am concerned I never objected at all to light railways. I think the money that has been expended on them is good for the country, and I am pleased they have been made. I anticipate for Ireland a splendid success in the future when we get the management of affairs into our own hands, and these railways will then aid to develop the trade and commerce of the country. Some years ago, no matter what the state of the weather was, it was necessary to travel by car for long distances in the West of Ireland, in the total absence of railways, and when I went down first

*(6.21.)  MR. JORDAN : I beg again to bring under the notice of the House this very serious question of the Lough Erne drainage. The excess of expenditure over the estimate is more than double the latter, and the result is a tax of 9s. 6d. per acre on the average, which the community will not be able to pay. The right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Jackson) admits the facts, and says the case is a case of hardship, but he says the Board of Works is not culpable or

 COLONEL NOLAN : The work was offered in these districts when the price of meal was low, but I do not understand that the offer was renewed when the price of meal had gone up. The question is one of administration and not of policy. I doubt if it was a wise thing to offer a stone of meal for a week's work. There is no doubt that a great deal of employment can be obtained at 7s., and if the right hon. Gentleman wished to give employment in these districts his machinery was undoubtedly bad. I thing the first charge on the £8,000,000 collected in Ireland ought to be the relief of distress. I do not look upon that as charity, but as an assurance provided by the taxpayers. I thank the Government for having done their duty in regard to the relief of distress. As far as seed potatoes are concerned the relief has not been given on the same scale as it was given 9 or 10 years ago, and it is impossible to predict whether it will be successful or not. The light railways do not exactly

(2.5.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I wish to return the compliment to the hon. Member for Down, and to assure him that I believe he always says what he believes to be true—and his statements as to some agricultural facts are very interesting—but that his information is faulty, and causes him to miss the mark. I think he draws his bow rather badly when he says that the religious test is a means of ascertaining whether or not there is distress in the country. He may be right as to Presbyterians, but I know he is wrong when he comes to deal with the contributions received by Catholic clergymen as a test of the existence of famine or scarcity in Ireland. If you ask any Catholic clergyman in Ireland where he gets his living from, you will find that it is not from the very poor. He will tell you that from the very poor he does not expect anything—or very little if anything—but that it is from the strong farmers that he expects to obtain the means of subsistence. And the hon. and learned Member opposite must remember that when times are bad for the small farmers and peasantry it by no means follows that they are equally bad for the strong farmers. Take the condition of things

(4.15.)  MR. ATHERLEY-JONES  (Durham, N.W.) : I am extremely sorry to find myself out of sympathy with the hon. Member who has brought forward this Motion; but I must confess that, from motives of public interest, I am strongly in favour of the Attorney General being permitted to continue his private practice. I suppose it will be conceded, and indeed it has been conceded, by my hon. Friend that it is desirable to secure the most eminent talent at the Bar for the position of Attorney General. The Attorney General is the adviser of the Crown; he is not from the theoretical and historical point of view, even though in late years he may have become so, the adviser of the House of Commons; he is the adviser of the Crown, he has the conduct of the litigious business of the Crown in contested cases, and he is also the chief prosecutor in criminal cases. The hon. Member who moved the reduction of the Vote has said that the distinction which the office of Attorney General confers upon the holder is so high that the most eminent Members of the Bar would be induced to sacrifice their private practice in order to accept it. But if my hon. Friend deprives the office of the distinguished and unique position it at present enjoys his argument fails. What inducement has any eminent man at the Bar to accept the office of Attorney General? I have always understood that members of the Bar have accepted that office not so much for the sake of the official salary which they receive as for the increase of their private practice which it causes as well as the distinction which it confers. Is it likely that the most successful members of the Bar would surrender their lucrative private practice, bringing them an income of, perhaps, £20,000 a year, for the official

(2.48.)  MR. P. J. POWER  (Waterford, E.) : I was not here when the Chief Secretary made his statement, but I shall be glad if he will explain how he justifies the statement he made the other night in regard to the condition of Donegal, and where he got his statistics as to the votive offerings of the people on the occasion of funerals. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that the Government should be able to lay their hands on information of that kind. An hon. Member opposite has twitted the Irish Members with the amount of time they consume in talking. Our complaint is that although we have opportunities of expressing our views, no attention is paid to what we say, and that in point of fact our representations are completely ignored. If the hon. Member consults the volumes of  Hansard
*(4.43.)  MR. HALDANE  (Haddington) : No one wishes to make any personal criticism on this occasion on either of the distinguished occupants of the position of Law Officer of the Crown. There is a question of broad public interest involved, and it seems to me that that is the one point of view from which the matter can be discussed. It is not a question of the maintenance of the ancient office of Attorney General, or a question of individuals. It is a question

 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman say how many of those vacancies were caused by the holders of the offices having been raised to the Bench?
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : My proposal only refers to the Attorney General.
(3.33.)  MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I believe that neither of the Law Officers of the Crown is here, and the question I have to raise affects both of them. I have no objection, however, to the Home Secretary dealing with the question. I feel that I owe an apology to the Committee for bringing forward this question at so late a period of the Session, as I have already brought it forward twice, but circumstances have arisen since the matter was last discussed that throw great light upon it. The question which I desire to raise by moving a nominal reduction of the Vote is whether in future the Attorney General, as chief law adviser of the Crown, should, in addition to the large income which the State pays him for contentious and non-contentious business, be allowed to take private practice. The fixed salary paid by the country to the Attorney General is £7,000 for non-contentious business, and it appears from a Parliamentary Return that, taking an average of six or eight years, he receives in addition to that an income of about £4,400 a year for contentious work or appearing as an advocate on behalf of the Government in Government cases. The Solicitor General's income is nearly £9,000, so that the two Law Officers of the Crown receive between them about £20,000 a year. This appears to me to be a very large sum to pay the two Law Officers, but I do not rise to call attention to that point. I want to lay down the principle which is practically accepted in the case of all other servants of the Crown—that they ought to devote their whole time and attention to the duties for which they are paid, and not have their attention distracted and their time monopolised by their private practice and their private interests. When on a former occasion I brought forward this question, I understood the First Lord
 34 "In my opinion, any Attorney General who desires to fully discharge the duties of his office must be prepared to sacrifice the emoluments to be derived from private practice, at any rate during that portion of the year in which Parliament is sitting." 35 "I purpose not to divide myself between Her Majesty and the causes of other men as others have done, but to attend to her business, only hoping that the whole man, meanly able, may do as well as half a man, better able." Times 36 v. v. 37 "As far as I am concerned, I readily admit that to many men, and certainly to myself, the question of the amount of salary would have but little influence as regards the acceptance or refusal of such an appointment as that if offered. As regards an appointment so honourable as that of the Attorney General at present is, the honour must remain the chief inducement to accept it." 38
(4.0.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : I rise to support the hon. Member's Motion. As he has said, this is in no way a Party matter, nor is it likely to affect the present holder of the post; and if hon. Gentlemen are right in their anticipations of the result of the coming elections, the Motion, if carried, would first affect the Attorney General of the Party opposite. I regret that the Motion takes the form of a reduction of the salary of the Attorney General, for I have no desire to reduce that salary. I would rather see it increased. Differing from the hon. Member who has moved the reduction, I think the same rule ought to apply to the Solicitor General as to the Attorney General, because they are not only the advisers of the Government, but of the nation, which pays them, and they are the advisers of the House of Commons. The House is entitled to the presence of one or the other of its Law Officers during the whole of its sittings. In the Debates in the Grand Committee on the Bankruptcy Bill, it happened over and over again that neither Law Officer was present, although they were wanted very much to explain the meaning of doubtful clauses. Over and over again, too, the House has Suffered from the absence of the Law Officers. In a recent Debate on the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill we had an illustration. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Denbigh, to whose opinion as an ex-Judge Advocate

*(1.15.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I think Irish Member can fail to appreciate the energy with which the crisis in Ireland has been encountered. When I was about to make some observations on a previous Vote, and you, Sir, pointed out that those remarks would be relevant to the present Vote, I had no intention of finding fault; I merely wished to obtain some information as to the relief works in Mayo. I have no personal knowledge of the works, they have been undertaken since I travelled through the county in November. I am informed that these works have had the effect of keeping the people from their spring work upon their own holdings which is absolutely necessary, for the sake of a mere pittance of 7s. a week offered to them at the relief works. I am not finding fault; of course, I know these things will occur. I rose to ask when these works will be closed. Potato digging will not commence until October. Are the works to be carried on until the new potato crop is ready to be used? From the first I have thought that road making was an objectionable form of relief works, and that it would have been preferable to undertake drain age works for the permanent benefit of the holdings. The hon. and learned Member for Longford has referred to Donegal, and the Chief Secretary has heard a good deal about that county. I should be the last to stand in the way of anything being done for the county, but it may be said that Donegal has fared fairly well so far as railway works are concerned, two lines being constructed almost entirely at the expense of the State—
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Through gentlemen's domains.
(1.30.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I hoped to have had some statement as to the County of Donegal, a county which, beyond question, has not received sufficient attention. The condition of Donegal has several times been raised in the House by Members not now present, and the Dungloe district has been specially brought to notice, and undoubtedly at the present time keen distress exists in that district. I do not pretend to local knowledge to enable me to criticise the action of the Government; but I take the experience of those who are best entitled to speak—the priests of Donegal—and I am led to think the efforts of the Government have failed in that county. It was a cutting observation the right hon. Gentleman made use of in a previous Debate to the effect that the distress could not be keen inasmuch as the people had continued to contribute to the support of the clergy in Donegal for the last six or eight months. In my judgment, a more offensive and fallacious test of the poverty of the people could not be applied. Of course we recognise it is the duty of those belonging to a religion to support the ministers of that religion. Those who preach the Gospel must live by the Gospel. To suppose that because well-to-do people subscribe for the support of the priest of the district therefore there is no poverty is absurd. As well might you point to the subscriptions in aid of hospitals in London, and say, therefore there is no distress. I regret the right hon. Gentleman should have imported this suggestion into his observations; that he should have indicated this as anything approaching a test of the distress in Donegal. However the priests of Donegal may be misled by over-

 MR. T. M. HEALY : Has the right hon. Gentleman inquired into the condition of the Dungloe district?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I have a telegram just now stating that these people are still hungering.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to make special inquiries as to the state of the people in Dungloe?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Can the right hon. Gentleman also give the districts?
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I presume that the Chief Secretary will make a statement upon this Vote.
(6.0.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : The right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary made a remark which was as much calculated to do mischief as anything I have ever heard. I gathered that what he said was to the effect that the persons who lost their money in public companies were those who tried to get large interest for it, and were no more to be pitied than the directors and promoters who took their money. I do not think a more unfortunate observation was ever dropped by a Minister, and I hope some Member of the Government will rise to correct it. The country is at this moment smarting under a number of public company blisters, and nothing could be more regrettable than the making of such an observation at this moment. It gives public company promoters to understand that, no matter what they do, they are not to be kept in check by the Public Prosecutor. No

 MR. JACKSON : I have no objection to doing that. I will give the hon. Member all the information I can.
(6.31.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : I am afraid I cannot add anything to what I said yesterday. The only charge that is made on the tenants is for the actual value received, and this is ascertained at a public inquiry where counsel may be employed by the tenants. I cannot add to the information I have already given. I do not admit that there is any responsibility on the Board of Works, and I can see no possible benefit from the inquiry suggested. The only charge made is for improvements ascertained by public inquiry, at which the tenants are allowed to appear.
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : May I ask what is being done by the Public Prosecutor in the Hurlbert case?

(6.13.)  MR. MORTON : I have a question to put to the Attorney General with regard to Revising Barristers, and as I do not see him in his place, I beg to move, Mr. Courtney, that you do report Progress.

(5.25.)  THE SOLICITOR GENERAL (Sir E. CLARKE,  Plymouth : My hon. and learned Friend is not able to be here, but I am sure I may say on his behalf that he is extremely anxious in the administration of the law, so far as it comes under his cognisance, to secure with regard to public prosecutions that there shall be equality of treatment of all persons, however different their position. Of course, a great many of these things are matters for the police, and they have to be considered by the police. My hon. and learned Friend is not acquainted with the facts of the case, but the hon. Member seems to be very well acquainted with them; and I am sure if he were to say anything to the Public Prosecutor, or make to a person responsible a statement of the facts, it would be fully considered.
 SIR E. CLARKE : The Court of Appeal reduced the damages in that case to £6,500.
 SIR E. CLARKE : It has been already stated to the House by the Attorney General that he has passed the matter over to me, and he has left the direction of the steps to be taken to me. It would be going beyond my duty if I were to state more than that steps are being taken for the examination of the materials upon which a decision must be arrived at. I do not think that I ought to make any further statement at present.
 SIR E. CLARKE : I will take an opportunity of ascertaining the facts and speaking to the hon. Member on the subject.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I have resigned myself to the inevitable. We cannot resist this Vote, but I wish to endorse the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness-shire, and to point out that if any particular class wishes to wring concessions from the Government its best policy is to start a Plan of Campaign.
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : We have just listened to a piece of special pleading on behalf of the present system, and that is just what I expected. I made no charge against the Public Prosecutor. I have no doubt he does his duty excellently well. What I have raised was the question of the desirability of his prosecuting in cases of company frauds. This, I complain, he does not now do.
 *SIR G. CAMPBELL : At any rate, Duncan attempted to conceal the money, and when it had been recovered the

(5.40.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : The Motion which I have to make is that which I have already very shortly laid before the Committee. My experience is that the Public Prosecutor in regard to public frauds is not easily moved. I do not blame the Public Prosecutor, who is under the Attorney General, and against whom it may be thought, therefore, my Motion ought to be directed. The Attorney General should be in the position of the Procureur General of France, or, to some extent, of the Lord Advocate, who is allowed to take a very limited extent of private practice. My view is that we should have a great and real system of public prosecution. We ought to get rid of that singularity of private prosecutions; they ought not to be conducted as between private litigants I do not think we will ever get rid of that superstition until we have a real Public Prosecutor—a real Attorney Ge-

 MR. R. T. REID  (Dumfries,  : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether a single person has yet been proceeded against by the police for any riotous or illegal conduct on the occasion of the Silksworth baton charge on 25th February last, although numerous persons wounded in that charge have commenced civil actions for damages against Superintendent Oliver and other policemen; whether his attention has been called to the fact that, on 7th April, Mr. Brewis laid informations against Police Constables Reed and Hodgson for perjury alleged to have been committed on 21st March, Mr. Storey, M.P., being one of the witnesses; and that thereupon, on 10th April, Police Constable Snaith, who was not present at Newport Farm, laid an information against Mr. Storey for perjury alleged to have been committed on 7th, March, 34 days before; that the summons against Mr. Storey was granted by Mr. C. J. Briggs, a County Magistrate, in the absence of the Magistrates' clerk, and made returnable to the County Bench in opposition to the unbroken practice since Sunderland obtained a Borough Bench 50 years ago; whether he is aware that Mr. Storey, having been committed by the County Justices, a Divisional Court quashed the committal with costs against the said Justices; after which a second summons against Mr. Storey was granted by two Borough Magistrates, and that on that occasion Mr. Strachan, the counsel for the prosecutors, stated that the prosecution was retaliatory; whether he is aware that, on 9th July, a Borough Bench, consisting of the usual rota, unanimously dismissed the summons without calling on Mr. Storey's counsel; that Snaith demanded to be bound over under the Vexatious Indictments Act, and was so bound, the Magistrates having no option; and that, on 17th, July, Mr. Strachan, the counsel for the prosecution, offered, in open Court, to withdraw the charge against Mr. Storey if the civil actions against the police were abandoned, and

 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FEEGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : I have seen the statement. Her Majesty's Government have not interfered, as the Foreign Enlistment Act does not apply to the case, and Her Majesty's Government have no power in the matter.
 DR. CAMERON : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies on what ground the Government of Malta has postponed the meeting of the Legislative Council, which should have taken place on the 15th instant, until the 31st of October; and whether their action in doing so has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State for the Colonies?
 DR. CAMERON : I understand that the prorogation was in accordance with the usual practice?

(4.35.)  MR. J. LOWTHER  (Kent, Thanet) : I do not wish to intervene in the controversy between the hon. Gentleman opposite, but rather to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what course he intends to pursue with regard to this matter in the future Session. The right hon. Gentleman speaks of postponing the matter on the ground of the late period of the Session. That may be a means of saving time and of promoting the convenience of the House; but has the right hon. Gentleman considered what expectation he has of dealing with this matter at any future time? There is much to be said in favour of the House allowing its Members to be dealt with according to law, and not interfering in their favour or against them when they are charged with offences which have no relation to their position as Members of the House. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer bases the Motion for discharging the order on the late period of the Session, I must enter a protest against its withdrawal on any such

 THE CHAIRMAN : The question has been put "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."
 BARON H. DE WORMS : I will lay on the Table a copy of the Act passed by the Newfoundland Legislature. The permanent measure which is in contemplation is still under consideration.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : Yes, Sir.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : As none of the unofficial members were disposed to accept seats in the Executive Council, and as there was no pressing business requiring that the Council of Government should sit later into the summer, the Governor, in accordance with the usual practice, has prorogued the Council until 31st October. This step does not require the sanction of the Secretary of State, but has his approval.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth) : The importance of establishing telegraphic communication with Tobago has not been overlooked, and it is hoped that the Revenue of that island may, before long, be able to bear the cost.

 DR. MACDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that the larger steamer that has been put on the Strome-Stornoway route by the mail contractor takes on an average a longer time than the smaller one previously used; whether, of late, the time used on the voyage has been weekly increasing; whether she is an old boat with defective boilers that cannot stand sufficient steam pressure; whether she frequently misses the 5.45. a.m. train from Strome, and so causes serious loss to fish curers and merchants in having their fish forwarded to the southern markets; why the time of departure for Stornoway has been altered from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. which causes the 5.45. a.m. train to be missed; whether he knows that her being allowed to call at Portree means a loss of three hours for passengers to or from Stornoway; and whether he will put sufficient pressure on the mail contractor to induce him to give an efficient and suitable service on this line?
 MR. J. S. GATHORNE-HARDY  (Kent, Medway) : May I ask whether there is any intention on the part of the Government to ask the House to sit on Saturday?

*(6.25.)  MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : This is a matter of greater importance than it appears. It is a question of whether or not you are going to meet the sentiment of the Irish people, who in all their struggles have never acknowledged that their interest in the land had any right to be taken away from them. It is unfortunate that you should put language into this Bill which will tend to defeat the object of the Bill. But it is of a piece with all ameliorative legislation for Ireland—something is done to make it unpleasant. It was so with Catholic Emancipation, the Catholic communities being then treated in a way to make that measure hateful. If you take away this acknowledgment of the tenant's interest you will make a great mistake.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I said the word was used in Acts of 1885 and 1888, and that we had better adhere to it as a matter of drafting.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I would suggest that it would be better to introduce after the word "the," in the third line, the words, "for the purposes of this subsection." Those words would, I think, carry out the object of the hon. Member.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : No, no.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I think the right hon. Gentleman is wrong. It appears to me the hon. Member's words will carry out the object he and the Government have in view, namely, that we should only consider the 25th part of the total amount allocated to the county under this clause.
(7.15.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I hope the hon. Gentleman will not press this. He appears to think that if either House of Parliament express an opinion adverse to the proposed allocation by the Land Commission then the old proportion would remain, but he will observe that the only effect would be that if objection were taken nobody would get the advances, and that is not our desire
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : If the hon. and learned Gentleman will allow me to speak, I think I may make a suggestion which will shorten the discussion. I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that there is great objection to allowing the Land Purchase Commissioners to be Judges in their own case, and, without going to a Court at all, putting themselves in possession of someone else's holding. In its present shape, therefore, the clause is inadmissible. I will now move that the House disagree with the Amendment, on the understanding that I may consider whether it will not be possible to bring up some Amendment to carry out the object which I think we ought all to regard as good. In face of the overwhelming objections urged by the hon. and learned Gentleman I cannot proceed with the clause.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It is an easy matter for hon. Gentlemen to say that we ought to bring in an Amendment in the House of Lords dealing with this question, but as a matter of fact, I have puzzled over this question as over the other numerous and complicated questions raised by the Bill. The real difficulty, as far as plantations are concerned, is that they are not parts of the holdings, and it is not possible to advance money upon them. The State might be asked to buy woods as well as turbary. Investments in turbary the Treasury expect to be recouped, whether it is or not; but woods are an investment of doubtful value. They do not come to maturity for many years, and during all the time they require careful supervision. I do not feel that I could go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and say, "Advance the British taxpayers' money in order to preserve timber." I have thought whether something might be done through the County Councils.
 171
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I confess I do not in the least understand the proposal and its retrospective action, and, therefore, propose to disagree with the Amendment.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Without going into the technical details, the object, shortly stated, is to enable landlords who sell out
 164
(7.45.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am inclined to think the locality will gain rather than lose by the Amendment.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Perhaps the simplest plan would be to omit the first paragraph.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Hear, hear.
(9.57.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. Member for West Belfast has raised two distinct issues on two Amendments, as to one of which I think he admitted it was rather a question of language than anything else, though he said, I think, that the one Amendment betrayed an animus against the Purchase Commisioners. The Bill, as it originally stood, did not mention specially the Inspectors' appointments, but only the Assistant Commissioners. The reason that they alone, out of all the officials connected with the fixing of fair rents, were mentioned was that there appeared to be some legal doubt as to whether they were persons "employed by the Land Commission." They were certainly not appointed by the Land Commission. It was said by lawyers that unless the Inspectors were mentioned by name it would not be competent to appoint them as permanant officials, and they were therefore specified in the Bill in this House. When the Bill came to the House of Lords the Treasury vehemently objected to those words. They said the Inspectors were only one of a number of classes of precisely similar  status 182 Cries of 183
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. Member is referring to the other Amendment.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Lord Londonderry.
(10.58.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I think that would be open to the objection which has been made before—that it would require collective action on the part of the Land Commission. I think that each separate member of the Commission should be able to express his opinion, and I desire to see that principle firmly embodied in the Bill. I accept the words "after receiving Reports from the Members of the Land Commission."
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Yes, I would gladly accept those words.
(11.15.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR  was understood to say: I think the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, think it unnecessary to press his objection. As originally introduced, the insurance amount was based upon the judicial rent, but it was afterwards pointed out that in some cases the judicial rent had not been practically acted upon, and we were asked, "how is it to be expected that a tenant will enter into an agreement for purchase when he will for five years be called upon to pay 10 per cent. more than his present rent?" We accepted an Amendment. But then we were met with the difficulty that the abatement might include an abatement made in respect to the agreement to purchase. The hon. Member proposes to avoid this, but he cannot altogether avoid the difficulty that the abatement might be held to cover a conspiracy to refuse payment, or an amount of arrears so long due that a landlord hopeless of recovering might wipe it off as a bad debt. After much consideration we have adopted the plan embodied in the Lords' Amendment, by which judicial and non-judicial rents are placed upon the same footing, the Commission making a re-valuation.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The question of the amount of the insurance will be determined by re-valuation.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The amount of the advance has nothing to do with the tenants' Insurance Fund.
 Mr. A. J. BALFOUR : I concur with the object of the hon. Member. I only doubt if it will be effected by his proposal. I will not, however, oppose it.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It does nothing of the kind.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : My hon. Friend, then, is posing as the champion of the Irish Protestant Church.
(5.16.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : I am not sure that the course which has been pursued by the House is a convenient one, though I believe it is not without precedent. In the circumstances, however, I cannot remain altogether silent, but I fear the brief statement I have to make will not be fully satisfactory to some of the Irish Members. I cannot say what course the House will take in the matter; I can only indicate what the Government will respectfully invite the House to do. Points have been raised with regard to six or seven Amendments, and in the majority I am afraid I cannot meet the wishes of hon. Members opposite. With respect to the office of the Land Commission, I should be sorry to make myself responsible for any Amendment which would have the effect of preventing individual members of the Commission from expressing their opinion to the Lord Lieutenant and giving him material upon which to form a judgment as to the proper men to be appointed. I am not disposed, however, to introduce anything into the Act which would deprive the Lord Lieutenant of the authority given him. I cannot conceive that the Lord Lieutenant would feel it part of his duty to exclude from his consideration any representation made to him either by the Land or by the Purchase Commissioners. Another point raised is with regard to the phrase "the interest which the tenant purchases in his holding." I think it will be admitted that the modification introduced by the Lords into the measure will have no operative or administrative effect. It is a matter, no doubt, for discussion whether the wording which they have adopted or the wording of the Bill is the most appropriate; but I think it can hardly be maintained that any difference at all
 147 148 149
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I think it will be accepted on all sides that the House ought to encourage these tenants to pay part themselves. It diminishes the risk to the taxpayer and the localities, but it does more than that, because, if you get a very large body of tenants to pay one-fourth of the purchase money themselves, a much larger total amount becomes available for land purchase than would otherwise be the case. The question is whether the encouragement we give is too much. I do not think it is. I think we may well ask the locality to give up the 5s. per cent. However, I do not wish to prolong discussion, and I will accept the hon. and learned Member's proposal if he will agree to alter £3 15s. to £3 17s. 6d.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. Gentleman apparently forgets the argument which I addressed to the House earlier in the evening, to the effect that these words would not make any substantial alteration in the working of the Bill, and that it was merely a question of drafting. I still adhere to that view. It is true that the tenants in Ireland are

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. and learned Member will admit that I am using the word not inaccurately when I say that a Court of Law would regard the landlord as the owner and not the tenant.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I think that is so. No doubt the landlord and tenant, regarding them as part of a productive machine, are part of one concern. The hon. and learned Gentleman seems to have forgotten that this is not the first Land Purchase Bill passed by the House of Commons. The whole of this Bill is drafted on the two preceding Acts, and I do not think it would be wise or expedient as a matter of drafting to insert in the middle of a new Act fresh distinctions.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Bill of last Session was not passed. Considering that the measure is based on two preceding Acts, it would be an unfortunate and an inexpedient thing to introduce new language. The Land Purchase Act has been in operation for six years, and nearly £10,000,000 have been applied, and to say now that the tenant buys only the landlord's share of the holding is surely most superfluous. I think it is not a point on which it is worth while to engage in controversy with the other House. It is not a substantial point, so far as I can make out; it is a question of drafting, and I would, therefore, ask the House in this case to agree with the Amendment made in the Bill by the other House.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It is only due to my right hon. Friend to say that he has met the requests of the Irish Government in this matter with great liberality, seeing that the demands made upon him by that Department from time to time are of a very considerable character. I do not think it is very generous on the part of Irish Members to press my right hon.
 203
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Gentleman is not in order: that arises on the Stationery Vote.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The Question is "That the House doth agree with the said Resolution."
 *MR. SPEAKER : No.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Gentleman is exceeding all the limits of remarks on Second Reading. I do not say he is exactly out of order, but it is unusual on the Second Reading to go into such very small matters.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Gentleman could ask them in Committee.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Under the circumstances I shall reply to the question put to me by the hon. Member. A communication was made to me this morning by letter.
 *MR. SPEAKER : It is because the constitutional rights of the House are affected that I propose to answer the question. A Memorial was sent to me both in my personal and official capacity from certain electors of Belfast. I do not think it right to lay it before the House. It is, of course, a very different matter indeed from the subject I com-
 137
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I think he has misconceived the purport of the Amendment. I do not think that under it he is entitled to go into the whole financial policy of the Bill. That is quite outside this clause.
 *MR. SPEAKER : No; but the hon. Member is travelling very wide in discussing a question which I told him is out of order.
 *MR. SPEAKER : A simple question may be allowed, but the hon. Member is not entitled to speak again.
 *MR. SPEAKER : What is the hon. Member's suggestion?
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! The usual practice is for an hon. Member to state the substance of a Petition he presents, unless he desires it to be read by the Clerk at the Table.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! I called upon the hon. Member to present the Petition, not to read it.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 MR. FENWICK  (Northumberland, Wansbeck) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the language used by Judge Metcalfe in delivering Judgment in the case of "Kilby and Coleman  v. Western Daily Mail
 MR. FENWICK : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that this man goes out of his way to denounce in a wholesale and indiscriminate manner the officials connected with Trades Unions, and that he declared in reference to certain actions for compensation, under the Employers' Liability Act of 1886, that if the Union Secretary appeared in them in future he would disallow the costs, and that he was strongly tempted to do so then, although the facts of the case were clear, and showed that the accident occurred in consequence of the negligence of the employer? Will the right hon. Gentleman call the attention of the Lord Chancellor to the conduct of this man, who repeatedly goes out of his way to denounce persons whose probity can in no way be called in question?
 MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH  (Inverness-shire) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he has received communications from the proprietor of the Island of North Uist and others, complaining of the inefficiency of the local and internal postal services; and whether he can state the annual postal revenue from the island, and the cost of these internal services?
 MR. MILNES GASKELL  (York, W. R., Morley) , who was imperfectly heard
 108
*(3.10.)  MR. C. S. PARKER  (Perth) : As Chairman of the Court of Referees on ordinary occasions, I have very little to add to what has been stated by the Chairman of Committees, but I think it is only right to remind the House that the proposed Standing Order would apply not only to Water Bills, to which he has specially referred, but to Railway and all other Private Bills alleged injuriously to affect the county. It would be a new function for County Councils, but I see no reason why they should not be admitted to be heard against any such Bill, subject to the judgment of the Court of Referees, as to whether the alleged injury is of such a nature and degree as to justify the intervention.
 *MR. C. S. PARKER : The difference between this and the previous Standing Order is that this relates to water only, and is not permissive but imperative, taking the question altogether out of the jurisdiction of the Court of Referees. Urban Local Authorities have such a right to be heard, and what this Standing Order does, is to place County Councils
 109
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : Nearly all the County Councils of counties in England and Wales which would be affected by the alterations in county boundaries proposed by the Boundary Commissioners have made Reports to the Local Government Board on the subject. The representations affecting each county have already, almost without exception, been communicated to the County Councils interested, and the proposals as regards the parishes comprised in different Unions have also in almost every instance been communicated to the Boards of Guardians, and have been considered by them. Publicity has, therefore, been given to the representations, and the Board have no reason to doubt that those interested in the question have full information on the subject. As the Return would be a voluminous and costly one, my hon. Friend will not, I trust, under the circumstances which I have mentioned, think it necessary that a Return should be presented.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : I do not remember having given any undertaking of the kind referred to by the hon. Member, but as far as the Government are concerned they have no objection to offer to the proposed Standing Order.
 *MR. RITCHIE : It would require to be introduced in a General Powers Bill.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam) : I cannot answer for the accuracy of the figures and proportions cited by the hon. Member, but I have given instructions that in future Returns of this kind names against which an asterisk or mark is placed in pursuance of Section 7, Subsection 5, of the County Electors Act, 1888, shall, if possible, be excluded.
*(6.18.)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : What I stated was that in many instances the interest of the tenant had sold for a larger sum than the interest of the landlord.
 MR. MADDEN : These words are superfluous, and unnecessary words in an Act of Parliament are mischievous.
 MR. MADDEN : I think the Amendment would act as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out.
 *MR. MADDEN : The effect of the Amendment is to provide that in such cases where there has been a redemption of certain charges such as is contemplated in the clause antecedent to the passing of this Act, then such transactions shall not be deemed invalid.
 *MR MADDEN : The Government are quite willing to consider the suggestion, and no doubt it would be an advantage if, for the purpose of sale, the Land Commission were in a position to give clear possession.
*(11.33.)  MR. MADDEN : I hope the hon. and learned Member will reconsider the position he has taken up. The Amendment abolishes the hard and fast rule that the judicial rent is to be the test in all cases where such a rent has been fixed. That rule would undoubtedly have worked unfairly in some cases, such as those brought before the House when the matter was discussed on Report, and the Amendment will allow the tenant to go before the Commissioners and re-open the question. In a case where the judicial rent is £100 a year and the landlord or receiver has accepted £75, it will be open to the tenant to have the annual value fixed on a revised valuation.
 *MR. MADDEN : The question under discussion has nothing to do with the amount of the purchase-money, but merely with fixing what shall be the purchase annuity for the first five years. The tenant knows that the judicial rent will be  primâ facie
 *MR. MADDEN : This section of the Act of 1881 not only enables the Land Commission to appoint and make use of sub-Commissioners, but enables the Land Commission to delegate to them the function of fixing fair rents. Of course, it was never intended that the Land Commissioners should delegate any duty in relation to sanctioning agreements for sale or duties in relation to title arising thereon. This clause prevents the powers of delegation being used for purposes for which they were never intended.
 *MR. MADDEN : The last mentioned arrangement is the better of the two ways of settling the difficulty.
 *MR. MADDEN : On the Report stage I will propose to change the word
 210
 *MR. MADDEN : No doubt it is a somewhat drastic clause, and I think there is one respect in which it requires alteration. I was about to propose an Amendment—
 MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : In the absence of the Under Secretary of State for India I beg to postpone the question of which I have given notice—To ask whether the Secretary of State is aware that Mr. Slater, a junior barrister, has been appointed by the Bombay Government to act as Chief Residency Magistrate at Bombay; and whether Mr. Slater is duly qualified, according to the regulations, to hold this appointment?
 MR. KNOX : The object of this Amendment is to have the amount of advance and of the annual value to be settled at one and the same time instead of having two different inspections.
(11.10.)  MR. KNOX : I move to disagree with the Lords in this Amendment. It will be remembered that in discussion of the point to which this Amendment is directed it was represented that to take into account all abatements might be putting a premium on non-payment of rent, and although we thought that argument far-fetched, we, as a compromise, agreed to the words which the Lords now propose to strike out. The clause, as we left it, provided that in those cases where the judicial rent fixed in the earlier days of the Land Act now proves to be higher than the tenant can actually pay, the abatement shall be taken into account in fixing the annual value, and for fixing the amount the tenant shall pay in the first five years after purchase. I am sure that to accept the Lords' Amendment will go far to stop land purchase in Connaught. On every well-managed estate there has been considerable abatement on the judicial rent, and if these are not taken into account, the result will be that the purchasing tenant will in the first five years pay more than he has been paying hitherto, and no tenant will be prepared to do this, and so land purchase will be at a standstill until this Act is amended. This is not a consummation desired by the Chief Secretary, who has often expressed a wish that this Act should be extended rather more than the Ashbourne Act to the West of Ireland. I know that in many parts of the West the effects of this Lords' Amendment will be fatal to purchase. So far as I
 195
 MR. KNOX : Perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me to ask what is meant by the words "such sale"? It seems to me this is a clause to provide that the Land Commission may employ the dismissed servants of the Land Corporation. The hon. Member for South Tyrone intends to get rid of part of his ragged regiment, and the Land Commission, apparently, are going to take them on.
 MR. KNOX : I do not know what "such sale" means. Perhaps the At-
 166
 MR. KNOX : The condition which we contend for is adopted already by the Act of 1885, Section 8, which makes it clear that the distinction is already drawn in the previous Act. I fail to see now why we should be asked to accept what is really a change in the law—a change of the terminology to be employed. I venture to think that if this alteration be carried it will be necessary to have a consequential Amendment to the effect that the tenant has a certain interest in the holding. I hope the Chief Secretary will not force us to continue this discussion, especially as we are supported, not only by Members on these Benches, but also by the Member for South Tyrone.
 MR. KNOX : I understand the right hon. Gentleman to suggest that after the word "the," the words, "for the purposes of this sub-section" should be inserted. It is difficult to see precisely what the sub-section would direct the Land Commission to do. I venture to think that the Amendment suggested by the hon. Member for West Belfast is the only one that will carry out his object.
 MR. KNOX : The Amendment I propose by adding another sub-section will, I think, be accepted. Its object is evident: to give direction to the Land Commissioners to give a
 162
 MR. KNOX : I withdraw the Amendment.
(5.36.)  MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I wish to move an Amendment providing that a tenant who advances one-fourth of the purchase money himself shall not have the whole of the advantage which the Lords propose to give him. I think the House might agree that the tenant who receives three-fourths only should get as good terms as the tenant who receives the whole, and to that extent I think the Lords' Amendment is beneficial; but when it goes further and says that those tenants who are generally large and wealthy tenants are to pay nothing in order to provide better housing for the labourers, I cannot see why the House should assent to that. The smallest tenant who buys under this Bill will pay 5s. on every £100 advanced for the better housing of the labourers. As it is, there will be a great temptation for men to borrow at higher rates in order to enable them, as it were, to pay the one-fourth out of their own pockets. It will be unfortunate if they do this, from the point of view of the State, and of the man himself. I, therefore, propose the Amendment of which I have given notice.
 ADMIRAL FIELD : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether the 6-inch gun, which recently burst with such disastrous results on board H.M.S.  Cordelia Active Cordelia's
 ADMIRAL FIELD : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the Secretary of State has considered the recommendation of the Acting Governor of St. Helena, in No. 118, Colonial Reports, page 17, as to receiving Imperial assistance towards meeting the expenses of the Government, especially in the matter of the salary of the Governor, in view of the fact that the inhabitants are suffering from the general depression caused by the diversion of ship traffic to the East, from the Cape route to the Suez Canal, whereby the number of vessels calling at the island has fallen from 853 in 1869, to 288 in 1889; and, seeing that the island is held solely for Imperial purposes, and that the revenue is insufficient for local requirements, will the Secretary of State be prepared to ask Parliament for a grant in aid as formerly?
 ADMIRAL FIELD : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether any Report has been received from our Consul or representative at Buenos Ayres relative to distressed British subjects anxious to return to this country owing to inability to obtain employment; whether he has read the accounts published in the  Buenos Ayres Standard
 ADMIRAL FIELD  (Sussex, Eastbourne) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State
 114
 SIR E. J. REED : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury if his attention has been called to the following facts recorded in the Preliminary Report upon the Census of England and Wales for 1891, namely, that the number of Members of the House of Commons for England and Wales, irrespective of the Universities, being 490, and the enumerated population being 29,001,018, an equal numerical distribution would give one Member to 59,186 persons (p. xii.); and that the present population of the Cardiff District of Boroughs exceeds 132,000, and is represented in the House of Commons by one Member only, while the aggregate populations of Durham City, Pontefract, Bury St. Edmunds, Grantham, Penryn and Falmouth, King's Lynn, and Boston, which amount only to 120,239, are represented in this House by seven Members (Table III.), and whether he will undertake to submit to Parliament, in its next Session, a measure for giving to the Cardiff District of Boroughs more adequate representation?
 SIR E J. REED : May I ask whether there cannot be some automatic arrangement for a periodical revision of representation such as is the practice in the United States?
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The War Department benefits by receiving in confidence a free expression of the views of the Head Masters; and it would militate seriously against that freedom if the idea gained ground that such Reports might subsequently be made public. It follows that I am not prepared to comply with the suggestion in the second paragraph of the question.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle) : The Land Transport Corps who served in the Crimean and Indian Campaigns would have a claim to generous treatment as other soldiers who served in the same campaign.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : The question of the hon. Member describes the tribute of Cyprus as duo to the creditors of the Porte. So far as the Government is concerned, their obligation is to the Porte, and not to its creditors. I mention this lest some misapprehension should arise from my taking no notice of this suggestion in the question. With regard to the substance of the question, the times have not been propitious for either of the two operations specified by the hon. Member, and I can make no declaration at all as to what I might ultimately be able to do.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Gentleman asks me a question of great political scope, and I do not feel that I am able to deal with such a wide issue on this occasion.
 MR. GOSCHEN : No, Sir. I understand that the Bill is highly contentious, and it would be contrary to our pledges to give such facilities.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I am not prepared, on behalf of the First Lord of the Treasury, to give the pledge suggested by the hon. Member. If the question of proportional representation is to be dealt with, it would have to be considered generally and would raise some extremely interesting issues. I do not think it could be dealt with in the piecemeal manner proposed.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I think that if this question were opened and considered generally it would give rise to some extremely interesting issues.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I will state later in the evening whether there will be a Saturday sitting or not. The Government are anxious to consult the general convenience of all hon. Members, but the question is whether hon. Members would prefer to sit on Saturday, or, by not sitting on Saturday, sit a day longer at the close of the Session.
*(4.42.)  MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman has stated that there is no evidence of the intention of the hon. Member for East Belfast to appear in his place in the House. The certificate

 *MR. GOSCHEN : I was about to move that the Order on the Paper for the attendance of Mr. de Cobain be discharged. I have carefully considered what passed in the House a few days ago, and I have certainly come to the conclusion—and nothing I have heard has tended to weaken it—that I shall be meeting the wishes of the House if, in view of the medical certificate, I move that the Order for the attendance of Mr. de Cobain be discharged. I am bound to add in this matter that it appears to me that we have simply to look to the impartial duty of this House, and that we have to take care that there shall be no assumption of guilt, notwithstanding whatever appearances there may be, one way or the other, and that we cannot allow political considerations, even when connected with so important a constituency, to induce us to move one step in setting a precedent which may be of considerable scope in the future. My hon. Friend (Mr. T. W. Russell) asks me whether I have taken the political convenience of the electors into consideration.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I did not say Party considerations, and I do not for one moment suggest that my hon. Friend meant Party considerations; he meant the political consideration whether the constituency should remain without its Member or not. That is, no doubt, a very important consideration, but I am bound to say I look also to the fact that we are close to the end of the Session, and I think we are bound not to deviate from the course we consider right, namely, that, in the face of the declarations made, we should not proceed to expulsion. I venture to think that that will be the general sense of the House, and I therefore beg to move that the Order for the attendance of Mr. de Cobain be discharged.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : As I can only address the House once I shall be glad if the right hon. Gentleman will allow me to reserve what I have to say upon the point he has raised until I am enabled to reply generally to hon. Members who desire to discuss this Amendment.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I recognise the spirit of conciliation shown by hon. Members in allowing the Bill to be read
 199
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I do not think that the hon. Member will find any provision enacting that the dividend on cancelled stock shall be re-placed.
*(9.22.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I do not know whether to condole with, or congratulate, the hon. Gentleman. I congratulate him on his evident enjoyment of his conundrums, but, on the other hand, I condole with him because it seems that this question of the Sinking Fund weighs on his brain to such an extent that he cannot put his questions within the ordinary compass, and what he calls a simple question degenerates into a series of propositions which no single person in the House can understand. I am bound to say that one or two sentences that fell from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bradford, and from the hon. Member for West Belfast, seem to me to show a much better understanding of the subject than
 176
 MR. GOSCHEN : I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman opposite that it is very possible that after 30 years the 2¾ Stock may be made 2½ Stock, and then the question will arise, What will become of the difference in the dividend? There is no provision as to that; it has been intended to give a certain amount of elasticity in this matter to the Treasury, and they will have power to deal with such a case and also with the case of a universal strike. The real cardinal
 177
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN, St.  George's, Hanover Square) : I find, on inquiry, that, on the whole, a Saturday Sitting this week would not be likely to advance the Business of the House.
*(12.7.)  MR. GOSCHEN : Here again I think if hon. Members will study the contents of the Bill they will see that this would not be an equitable arrangement, having regard to the risk the Exchequer undertakes. It would amount to this: that for any loss that might accrue the Exchequer would be responsible, but in any gain the tenants would share. In five out of six cases there might be a loss, and yet the gain in the other case would be divisible among the purchasers. Those who have paid for the turf or the turbary rights will have got all they are entitled to, and will have no rights in the bog when it is exhausted. Any profit there may happen to be should go to the settlement of the general transaction, and this, I think, is only fair. We had grave doubts whether we ought to allow the Land Commission to enter into these transactions at all.
*(12.5.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I am sorry again to have to refuse assent to the hon. Member's proposal. It may be that the security may not remain in existence for 15 years. It will be a security which will be diminishing year by year while the loan remains. We have not said that the loan must be paid off in a given number of years, because we think it is better to leave this to the discretion of the Commission, who I do not think will exercise that discretion in a harsh manner.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I will endeavour to arrange that the Bill shall be taken at a time to allow of full discussion. I know that great interest is taken in it, and, though I cannot fix a time just now, the hon. Member may rely that the opportunity shall be given.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I regret that I cannot meet the hon. Member in this-Three and one-eighth is the lowest rate at which public loans are made, even in cases such as loans under the Housing of Working Classes Act, 1890, where special arrangements are made for security. In this case, as the hon. Member must admit, there is a greater risk to the Exchequer than in the Land Bill, for there is no security but the bog itself. The Treasury have

 MR. HASTINGS  (Worcester, E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he will lay
 111
 MR. HASTINGS : I beg now to move a new Standing Order entitling County Councils to be heard against Bills dealing with water supply. In so important a matter as the pollution of water, I think that any County Council whose district is likely to be injuriously affected should have the right to be heard. I am aware that the proposed Standing Order differs in some degree from the existing Standing Order in regard to the rights of Local Boards, but I think it docs so rightly, inasmuch as the area of a county is much larger. A stream may have its source in one county and flow through another. I hope the House will agree to the proposal.
(3.0.)  MR. HASTINGS  (Worcester, E.) : I beg to move a new Standing Order, giving to the Councils the right to appear and oppose Private Bills. At the present moment Town Councils and Local Boards have a  locus standi
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : Seeing that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has returned to his place, I beg to repeat the question which I put to the Government just now. I wish to ask him whether the words it is now proposed to add are intended to modify in any way Subsection 2, of Clause 1. Since the discussion which took place upon the subject in this House I have seen the opinion of a Barrister who was consulted in regard to it, and that opinion was to the effect that the process of retardation which the Chancellor of the Exchequer alluded to will not take place under the clause as it stands. What I desire to know is whether the words it is now proposed to add will cure that defect?
 *MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : This question is an important and difficult one, and I may remind the House and the Chief Secretary that in most countries in Europe, especially in France, where small ownerships prevail, the local authorities have power to prevent the cutting down of woods and plantations where they are necessary for the cultivation of the land and for shelter.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I should like to ask the Government the meaning of this Amendment. Is it intended to modify the wording of Sub-section 2, Clause 1, in regard to the sinking fund payments?
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : It is, I think, a reasonable proposition, and might even be extended.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I am inclined to think that the Amendment before the House would be an improvement, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary will stand by the words he has now suggested.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : If the 1st sub-section is omitted the whole meaning of the clause will be obscure.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : I really hope the Chief Secretary will not insist upon the Amendment. I gather from him that he did not himself consider the words to be of any importance, his argument being that they are only necessary from a drafting point of view. He has also stated that the landlord is owner of the property. That may be so in strict law, but the Act of 1881 has recognised the interest of the tenant, and I say the very object of this Bill is to do away with dual ownership. Of course the landlord may still be the owner in a certain sense, but in point of fact the tenant is the co-owner, and the words in the Bill as it left this House recognised the interest of the tenant. I hope the Chief Secretary will not insist on the Amendment.
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : Mr. Speaker, I wish to read a Petition to the House, upon which is founded the opposition that I shall endeavour to lead to-morrow against these Bills. It is from the timber importers of Hull. It is as follows. [The hon. Member was proceeding to read the Petition, but was interrupted by loud cries of "Order."]
 MR. ATKINSON : I am sorry, Sir, but I asked you whether I should read the Petition, and you said "Yes."
 MR. ATKINSON : Well, I would rather the Clerk should read it, than read it myself.
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will allow the poor women and men of the Salvation Army, who are sentenced to prison at Eastbourne, to be visited on Saturday next by a Justice of the Peace of Hull, Middlesex, Westminster, and Sussex, of 27 years' standing, whose object is to see if complaints made to him of the bad treatment of the Salvation Army by other Justices of Sussex are correctly made?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether, in order to remove some misapprehension which seems to exist as to a recent case at Wolverhampton, he can state what is the existing law as to licensed victuallers supplying alcoholic liquors after the legal hours in cases of illness; and whether it is legal to supply them in such cases upon a Magistrate's order or upon a medical certificate?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether any, and if so what, steps have been taken to provide a new school in place of the National School, at Kineton (Warwickshire), which was condemned by Her Majesty's Inspector in July, 1890; whether the Department has received satisfactory assurances that the necessary funds for building will be provided by voluntary subscriptions; and, if so, when the new school will be ready for use; and whether, if such assurances have not been given, the Department will adopt

 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E, Rugby) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that, in the Return ordered to be printed on the 7th July, 1891, showing the number of electors on the register in each Parliamentary constituency, in the cases of upwards of 200 county divisions in England and Wales the numbers of electors returned include not only such duplicates as were usual before the passing of the Local Government Act in 1888, but also duplicates of voters on the ownership lists whose names are also included for County Council purposes on the occupation lists, and are marked §; and that these duplicate names so marked are in many cases 10 per cent. or more of the total number of voters given in the Return; and whether, inasmuch as it would be easy for the Returning Officers to count the names so marked and to deduct them from the total number, he will give such instructions as will remedy this alleged
 112
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I am informed by the Chief Constable that no person has been proceeded against by the police in connection with the proceedings at Sunderland of February 25 last. Civil actions for damages are pending, as I am informed, against members of the police force. The informations for perjury were laid on the dates mentioned in the question. The summons against the hon. Member for Sunderland was granted by Mr. Briggs, a County Magistrate, the deputy clerk, who is a solicitor, being present. The Magistrate's clerk informs me that the summons was made returnable to the County Bench because it was a charge arising out of a case heard by County Magistrates, and was therefore considered a county case, and, as such, returnable to the County Bench according to the usual practice. The Divisional Court quashed the committal, with costs against the Justices, on the ground that they had refused to allow the Borough Magistrates to sit with them in the adjudication. A second summons was then granted against the hon. Member by the Borough Bench. I am informed by the clerk to the Borough Justices that the counsel for the prosecution expressed his own opinion that it was to be regretted that all such proceedings had not been allowed to drop when the strike was finished, but, as proceedings were commenced by other parties, his client was bound to proceed. The Borough Bench unanimously "dismissed the summons, and Snaith demanded to be bound over, a similar course having been pursued in the charge of perjury against Inspector Dobson, which had also been dismissed by the Borough Bench. I have seen a newspaper account of the proceedings before the Judge of Assize, from which I infer (and this is confirmed by the Chief Constable, who was present in Court) that both charges, that against the police and that of the police against the hon. Member for Sunderland,

 *MR. MATTHEWS : I can only judge by the newspaper report, which states that after a suggestion had been made by the Judge, and after the hon. Member for the Brigg Division (Mr. Waddy), who appeared for Mr. Storey, had acceded to it, the counsel who represented the police offered also to withdraw the charge against Mr. Storey. Mr. Strachan said he withdrew it unreservedly, and urged that byegones should be byegones. That, no doubt, involved a proposition that everything should cease, but afterwards the charge against Mr. Storey was unreservedly withdrawn.
 MR. MATTHEWS : It would be extremely improper to use the Criminal Law in order to secure a withdrawal of civil actions; but I may point out that the newspaper report with which I have been furnished is not in accordance with what the hon. Member has just read.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The  Durham County Advertiser.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am wholly unaware of the facts mentioned by the hon. Member.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have seen a newspaper report of the case I have no control over County Court Judges. I would suggest that if the hon. Member wishes to make any representation on the subject he should address himself directly to the Lord Chancellor.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have not seen the newspaper referred to by the hon. Member. I have no information that the Magistrate in question is in the habit of granting occasional licences. He did, I believe, on two occasions grant such a licence, not being aware that on one of those occasions it had been previously refused at Petty Sessions. I am advised that his action was lawful under the provisions of the 26 & 27 Vic., c. 33.
 MR. MATTHEWS : If my hon. Friend is a Justice of the Peace for the County of Sussex he requires no authority from me to visit and inquire into the treat-

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I have not seen any report in the public Press of what I said yesterday, but my remarks were made in reply to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Sir G. Campbell), who took the view that cases of fraudulent company-promoting were peculiarly such as the Treasury ought to prosecute. I, on the other hand, put forward the view that in the great majority of cases the persons who invest their money do so in the hope of great profits and with full knowledge of the risks they run, and that the public generally are not immediately concerned.
 *MR. RAIKES : The charge for telegrams from England to Russia are correctly stated by the hon. Member. From St. Petersburg to Russia in Asia the charge is, I believe, 4d. per word  plus régime
 *MR. RAIKES : That is not a matter which comes within my province.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : I have received communications on this subject from the proprietor of the island, and I have caused replies to be sent explaining in much detail the reasons against altering the existing internal postal service. There has not been time to ascertain exactly how the revenue from the corre-

 *MR. RAIKES : The mail steamer now serving Stornoway is not a new one, but I have no reason to believe that she is inefficient either from age or imperfect condition. She is a much larger steamer than the one formerly employed, and affords improved passenger accommodation. When the time for the voyage is exceeded, I am informed that the delay arises in a great measure from causes not within the contractor's control. The Harbour Commissioners of Stornoway offer no adequate facilities for landing the mails, though requested to do so, and during the fishing season there has been much difficulty in this respect. It is true that the steamer, on the inward voyage from Stornoway to Strome, has frequently missed the 5.45 a.m. train at Strome. This has arisen from her being detained on the outward journey from Strome to Stornoway by the late arrival of the mail train, and this delay again is occasioned by the late working of the train in the opposite direction, the line of railway being single and the fish traffic heavy. It was hoped that by

 MR. BARCLAY  (Forfarshire) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury if he will be good enough to state the conclusions of the authorities with respect to admission to Holyrood Palace?
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether he can state when the Scottish University Commissioners propose to present to Her Majesty their Special Report upon the questions affecting the theological faculties in the Scottish Universities; and whether, as soon as the Report has been presented, it, and the evidence taken upon the subject by the Commissioners, will be issued as a Parliamentary Paper?
 MR. FLYNN : Can I move a reduction of the Vote?
 MR. FLYNN : The contract was in existence, 'and was referred to in two prospectuses issued by the company. Perhaps the Treasury could not take away the contract, but I think they might in some way or other have let the public know that a false impression was conveyed in the prospectuses. I know several people in London who looked on the contract between the Treasury and the company—
 MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N.) : I happen to know that a very considerable number of people took shares in the Hansard Union largely on account of the fact that a contract had been concluded with the Government.
 MR. RENTOUL  (Down, E.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware that the Presbyterian and other missionaries in Morocco believe that they are at present in a position of great danger owing to the threats of the natives; and whether he can take any steps to secure the safety of the missionaries, or give any assurance which may allay the fears which the friends of the missionaries in this country entertain; whether he knows of any conduct on the part of the missionaries in any sense calculated to provoke hostility; and if he can point out any methods by which mission work could be carried on with greater safety in Morocco than at present?
 *MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The Commissioners have not yet settled the terms of their Report on this subject, but hope to do so on their re-assembling in the month of October. The hon. and learned Member will readily understand that until Her Majesty's commands have been received I am unable to answer the latter part of the question.
 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : The enumerators
 131
 MR. J. STUART  (Shoreditch, Hoxton) : Will any steps be taken to allow the London County Council to expend money?
 MR. J. JORDAN  (Clare, W.) : All our agitation has been for the recognition of tenant right, and it would be a great pity to insert words which would obliterate that recognition. If they do not alter the matter one way or the other, I do not see why the right hon. Gentleman should stick so tenaciously to them. The House of Lords know very little of the matter further than the collection of rents is concerned. I hope the feeling of the tenants will be consulted; and while I mean no disrespect to that august Assembly the House of Lords, I prefer to stick to the words of the House of Commons as they passed them. I advise the Chief Secretary to forego this Amendment.
(8.21.)  MR. JORDAN : I think some means should be devised by which both landlords and tenants may be prevented from cutting down timber in the country. I know cases where landlords have cut down timber and where tenants the moment they have bought out the landlords cut down every tree in the place. Something should be done to prevent these people from cutting down all the timber, and to require them to re-plant wherever they cut down. That system is in practice in Westmoreland. There they cut down the timber every 15 years; but they replant as they cut down, so that they have always timber to cut, and have always timber growing. It is the greatest possible pity that some scheme cannot be devised for the re-afforesting of Ireland. We have mountains that are fit for little—that are nude and bare—and it would be a great advantage to the country if some steps would be taken to plant them with trees.
 *MR. HENNIKER HEATON  (Canterbury) : I rise to order, Sir. May I ask whether I should be in order in moving that the hon. Member be no longer heard during the remainder of the Session?
 *MR. HENNIKER HEATON : Will the right hon. Gentleman give an assurance that representations have been, or will be, made to Russia on this subject?
 MR. HENNIKER HEATON  (Canterbury) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether the charge for a telegram from England to Russia in Europe is 5½d. per word, and the charge for a telegram from St. Petersburg to any part of Russia in Asia is about 4d. per word, whilst according to the Post Office Guide the charge for a telegram from England to Russia in Asia is for the first region 1s. 8d. per word, and for the second region 2s. 7d. per word, whereas the sum of the two separate charges from England to Russia in Asia is but 9½d.; and whether he can account for the discrepancy between the British charge for a telegram to Russia in Asia, and the sum of the above-mentioned two separate charges?
 *MR. KEAY : I am sorry to have to trouble the right hon. Gentleman with another question—
 *MR. KEAY : Does not the right hon. Gentleman admit that a continuation of the annual payments into the Sinking Fund of both the dividends and Sinking Fund payments on account of Stock cancelled, forms the very A B C of the principle of a cumulative Sinking Fund?
 *MR. KEAY : The right hon. Gentleman has just wound around my point. Will he explain how Clause 4, which provides for the Sinking Fund and payment of dividend to the Land Purchase account, provides for re-payment to the Consolidated Fund of the dividend on cancelled stock?
 *MR. KEAY : I am sorry if I cannot make my point clear. Although the Chancellor of the Exchequer may cancel £16,000,000 of the whole £46,000,000 of Stock issued on the 30th year, he will not be absolved from keeping on the paying into the Sinking Fund the same yearly amounts, not only of Sinking Fund payments, but of dividends on the cancelled Stock according to the very fundamental principle of Sinking Funds, seeing that Clause 4 provides that these payments are to be made yearly on the whole amount of the advances. Moreover, his doing so is absolutely necessary to save the British taxpayer, seeing that in any case the purchase annuities cease on the 49th year. All I have got to tell the Chancellor of the Exchequer is that, if he alters these payments in the way he proposes, by only paying 1 per cent. on outstanding Stock, the capital of every loan will only be paid off in 58 years instead of 49 years.
 *MR. KEAY : I have no intention of going into the general finance of the Bill. That is the last thing I would do. I take it that this is a provision to enable the Treasury to make rules for the cessation of those very dividends and payments to the Sinking Fund, which Clauses 1 and 4 of the Bill enact shall be paid out of the Land Purchase Account if the tenants pay, and out of the Consolidated Fund if they do not pay. I desire to point out that this is nothing less than a destruction by means of a rule of the Treasury of the Sinking Fund created by the Bill. This is the device now adopted by the Government to enable them to cover their retreat from the impossible arithmetical position which they have hitherto taken up. I am sorry the right hon. Gentleman will give me no indication that this is the object of the Amendment, and I am bound, therefore, to assume that it is. Assuming that it is, the question then arises, Will it effect its object? I take it that in the 30th year the right hon. Gentleman will try to cancel Stock to the amount of £16,000,000.
 *MR. KEAY : In fact the right hon. Gentleman accused me of invincible ignorance.
 *MR. KEAY : He also accused me of being in a muddle upon this question, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer went so far as to say that I had discovered a mare's nest. Now, I once more ask him how these dividends and Sinking Fund payments of £1,725,000, to be compulsorily met under Clauses 1 and 4 of this Bill, can possibly be met by a Guarantee Fund of £1,125,000 only?
*(9.0.)  MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I think the Government might be saved a great deal of time if they had not pressed this Amendment. As I read it, and I admit it is worded in a most guarded manner—it is an attempt on the part of the Government to correct the erroneous arithmetic of the Bill with regard to the Guarantee, Sinking, and
 173 174 Laughter.
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I think the Bill will prove to be highly contentious, and I shall spare no effort to defeat it. It contemplates taking money from the Disestablished Protestant Church of Ireland and giving it to the Roman Catholics.
 MR. KELLY : I do not profess to-champion the Irish Church.
 MR. KELLY : When the omission of words "Irish Temporalities Fund," in Clause 2, is moved, the matter will be very clear.
 MR. KELLY : I thought it would save time if I asked them now.
 MR. KELLY : I may be permitted to point out that this is the only opportunity I have of asking these questions.
(12.32.)  MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I desire to point out that in last year's Bill there was a clause providing for the expenditure of money in the purchase of a site for a council chamber and offices. The words "council chamber" were omitted. I believe the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the University of London had an idea that "site for offices" would include "site for council chamber." I did not hold that view, but I now wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman how it is that the words omitted from last year's Bill are inserted in this Bill. In reference to the expenditure on what is called a first class—
 COLONEL NOLAN : Of course, the objects the hon. Member has in view are useful objects; but if you are going to put these purchasers on a different footing to others, they cease to be proprietors at all.
 COLONEL NOLAN : This seems to be a most despotic clause; and if it is to be introduced at all, it should have been introduced in the Bill as brought in.
(5.41.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : The hon. and learned Member's argument is skilful, but the tenant will have to pay 5s. more if his proposal is agreed to. I protest against any class of tenants having to pay a shilling more to the British taxpayer than is absolutely necessary. I shall certainly vote against the tenant having to pay £4 when the Government are willing to let him off with £3 15s. I have always had great hopes that ultimately when the instalments have been well paid up the House of Commons will lower the percentage, which I think has been fixed higher than is absolutely necessary. If you had one section of the tenants paying £3 15s. and another £4, you would have an irresistible argument in favour of reducing the amount paid by the other tenants. The hon. and learned Member said his Amendment would increase the amount that would be given to the labourers. I think that is a mistake. I quite acknowledge that it is extremely proper that the overflow of the Guarantee Fund, if any, should go into the hands of the labourers. I must say I would sooner help the labourers by a more direct contribution from the State, and I think it would be a very great evil if we assented to the hon. and learned Member's Amendment.
 MR. J. WILSON  (Lanark, Govan) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the sum of money to be devoted to the old Crimean and Indian soldiers will also be applicable to the Land Transport Corps who served before the fall of Sebastopol?
 MR. COURTNEY  (Cornwall, Bodmin) : I do not rise for the purpose of opposing this Standing Order, nor the Standing Order which is to follow, but I think it is right the House should understand exactly what is proposed to be done. It is quite true that this Motion follows very much the lines of the Standing Order which applies to municipal towns, but there is a substantial difference to which I think attention ought to be called. Under the Local Government Act the County Councils are invested with many of the privileges of municipal towns, but they have no authority in respect to the water of a town, except to prevent the pollution of a river. The only question at issue is whether a County Council should have a right to appear in opposition to a Bill which may affect a particular district of a county, and it is proposed to leave it to the Court of Referees to say whether the County Council has a  locus standi. 107 locus standi locus standi. locus standi locus standi
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am informed that the Committee have prepared a Draft Report, but the subject has been found so difficult that the Committee consider it still necessary to make further inquiries and practical experiments, and it is not probable that the Report will be presented until next year.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W.) : The exports of galvanised sheets are already shown separately in the Annual Statement of the Trade of the United Kingdom; but I will refer to the Revising Committee, which meets in the Autumn, the question whether galvanised sheets can be separately entered in the monthly accounts of trade without unduly adding to the bulk of that publication.
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether enumerators for the Census of 1891,  i.e.
 MR. NEVILLE : But earlier in his observations the right hon. Gentleman said that undoubtedly the word owner was used in the Courts of Law. In that respect he is inaccurate. The term is utterly unknown in real property, and when it occurs in an Act of Parliament the Courts have to do the best to put an interpretation upon it. So far as the Amendment is defended as being accurate, I venture to think that my hon. and learned Friend is right, and that the Chief Secretary is wrong.
 MR. NEVILLE  (Liverpool, Exchange) : I beg to differ altogether from the Chief

 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether his attention has been called to

 MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether he is aware that an examination of the last Statement exhibiting the moral and material progress and condition of India shows the total number of places licensed for the sale of opium in the Indian Empire to be 11,244; and whether that number is correct, or the statement he made on 25th June, when he gave the total number of licences as 8,834?
 MR. STOREY : I was present in Court, and heard what was said.
 MR. STOREY said : I am prepared to raise this question in the House either by moving the adjournment or by making a personal explanation, but I am extremely unwilling that there should be any heat or controversy in the House on a matter personal to myself, as there would be if I were to move the adjournment. I prefer, therefore, after consulting with Mr. Speaker, to make a brief personal statement on a matter sufficiently notorious and which recently affected not only my personal liberty but the character which I had won by 30 years of public life. I do not at all assume that a Member of Parliament ought to be treated with more favour than another man, but, on the other hand, neither do I think the Criminal Law ought to be used as an engine of oppression against a Member of Parliament. The charge brought against me was that I had been guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury. I will not enter into the circumstances. I will not take the trouble to deny on the floor of this House that that charge was true, or that it had any truth in it.
 122 123 bonâ fide verbatim 124
 MR. STOREY : What is the newspaper the right hon. Gentleman has been furnished with?
 MR. STOREY  (Sunderland) : I wish to be permitted to suggest that something else followed, namely—
 121 "Mr. Strachan said: I shall call no evidence against Mr. Storey, on the understanding that all the other proceedings will also be stayed. Mr. Waddy: You mean the civil proceedings?—Certainly not. We are prepared to go on with this case. Whereupon Mr. Strachan said: Very well, I will withdraw the charge unreservedly. I offer no evidence."
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I do not object to my hon. and learned Friend calling attention to anything which fell from me in the course of the Debate, though I regret he was not here yesterday, so that any error I fell into might have been cleared up at the time. I accept the statement of the hon. and learned Gentleman to the fullest extent, and if I have fallen into error I desire to withdraw what I have said. But the report of my speech in the  Times
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I do not see, when the tenant purchasers get what they purchase, why at the end of a certain time they should get any more. This is not a question for the West of Ireland alone: it is a question for the whole of Ireland. Why should the Government make a present of the spent bog to the men who are able to buy their land?
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : May I remind the right hon. Gentleman that he promised to give us his view as to a Saturday Sitting?
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I think the clause ought to stand as it left this House. The House of Lords' Amendment takes away the recognition of the tenant's interest, and I am not disposed that such recognition should be blotted out. I do not think any great fuss need be made about it; I do not think it will affect purchase one way or the other; still I cannot be expected to support the proposal to blot out the recognition of the tenant's interest.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I hope the Government will not abandon the clause. [ Cries of
*(8.16.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I greatly regret that the Government did not deal with this when the Bill was before the House. It is a matter of the greatest importance in Ireland. I admit that the old landlords cut down the timber very considerably. In my own constituency at the present time they are cutting down the timber and selling it. We are creating a new race of proprietors, and, as a matter of fact, already under the Ashbourne Acts the damage they have done is immense. The new purchasers are cutting down the trees for the purpose of sale in every direction, and I think it a great pity that the Government did not deal with the question in the Bill.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I support the Motion to report Progress, and for this reason: I did not take a Division on the Second Reading; but this is a Bill which cannot be allowed to pass without some discussion and a Division. I will not now debate its merits; but I maintain that the Government ought to find an opportunity for an important measure like this to be discussed at an hour when the opinion of the House can be taken upon it. I mean to divide against Clause 1.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I do not think my hon. Friend is championing any man The hon. Member for Longford gave a graphic sketch of what would take place when this clause was passed. He pictured Lord Zetland dropping into the Kildare Street Club and there practically at the bidding of Mr. Wrench appointing four or five leaders of the landlord party to be Sub-Commissioners. Well, it struck me as singular that the hon. and learned Member should be so glad to take the word of the Chief Secretary to-night as to what was done in the House of Lords. I wonder he did not take the word of the right hon. Gentleman that he, as well as the Lord Lieutenant, would have something to say as to these appointments. As for the Kildare Street Club I could almost say that Lord Zetland has never set his foot inside it. At any rate I say that in suggesting that the appointments would be made by the Lord Lieutenant the hon. and learned Member forgets that the Chief Secretary will have his share of responsibility in the matter. The Amendment, which was inserted in this House without discussion, introduced a new feature into the Land Commission system. Did Lord Spencer or Mr. Forster take the advice of the Land Commission in making these appointments? No; they appointed all the Sub-Commissioners on their own responsibility. Up to two or three years ago that course was followed by every
 191
 *Mr. T. W. RUSSELL : I voted against it.
*(10.47.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : It is a great pity the hon. and learned Member for North Longford was not in the House when the Bill was going through the House of Lords. The hon. Member has rung the changes on the assertion that the Government got Lord Londonderry to do work which they were ashamed to do themselves. Well, I have the records of the House of Lords in my hand, and I find that the words in question were left out of the Bill not on the Motion of Lord Londonderry at all, but on that of the Lord Privy Seal, who was in charge of the measure in the other House.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : What right has the hon. and learned Member to say that?
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I have the authority of the Records of the House of Lords, and all this declamation that has been poured out about the Government using others to do what they are afraid to do themselves falls to the ground when it is brought to the simple test of fact. The hon. and learned Member was not even in the House when the Bill was passing through the Report stage, and yet he now comes forward and makes assertions without taking the least trouble to ascertain the facts. He commenced his speech by saying that the hon. Member for South Derry had taken special delight in championing the cause of Mr. Wrench. I did not think that very relevant to the

 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I have not considered their political convenience at all. It simply amounts to disfranchisement.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : The hon. Member has attributed to me a motive which it never occurred to me to entertain, namely, consideration for the candidates for East Belfast. What I had
 139
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I should like to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, in view of the practical disenfranchisement of East Belfast, by the course of events which has occurred, he will take that fact into account in considering the course which the Government will pursue?
(4.54.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I think the Government would do well to accept the suggestion of my hon. and learned Friend. One Amendment which will provoke opposition is the Amendment which provides that the tenant who asks for an award of three-fourths of the purchase-money shall pay interest at a lower rate. Such a tenant already has a great advantage in not paying anything to the Insurance Fund, and he least requires any additional advantage. The adoption of the Amendment will reduce the fund intended by the Act for the advantage of the labourers. In my opinion it is detrimental to the public interest. As to the Amendment of the Marquess of Waterford, it does more than it professes to do, and makes various changes in the law which will necessitate very detailed attention. Then the Lords provide that the tenant shall buy the holding, although since 1870 he has been a joint owner of the land. I do not know why this change has been made, unless it be because the Lords dislike any reference to the fact that the tenant has already any interest in the holding. I, therefore, ask the
 143 144 145
(6.5.)  MR. SEXTON : As the clause left this House it read to the effect that "where an advance for the purchase of a holding is less than twenty times the annual value as in this Act defined of the interest which the tenant agrees to buy in the holding," &c. This is the only place in the whole expanse of this Act in which reference is made to what the tenant buys; it is the only spot in which it is defined. In Committee on the Bill of last year we convinced the Government that they ought to define what is bought as "the interest which the tenant agrees to buy." That corresponds with the fact. It is not the annual value of the holding, but the annual value of the landlord's interest which is bought. If it were the annual value of the holding the tenant would have to buy the landlord's interest and his own interest as well. With all the respect I have for the House of Lords, I cannot be induced to consent to the insertion of these words. The right hon. Gentleman knows that it is not the holding, but the landlord's interest which the tenant buys. What reason can he put forward for inserting these fanciful words, which do not correspond with the facts of the case?
(5.50.)  MR. SEXTON : The hon. and gallant gentleman below me (Colonel Nolan) says he wants the Irish tenants to pay as little as possible to the British Treasury. I do not yield to the hon. and gallant Gentleman in the desire to secure the best terms for the tenant. That has been the object of the arduous labours we have undertaken on this Bill—labours in which the hon. and gallant Gentleman has given us no material assistance. I object to seeing the tenants treated unequally. I object to seeing the poorer tenants paying £4 per cent., whilst a small class of wealthy tenants escape at £3 15s. per cent., and are thus relieved of the obligation to contribute towards improving the wretched position of the agricultural labourers in Ireland. I doubt very much whether the argument of the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland is a sound one. He says it is desirable to encourage the tenants to find part of the purchase money. You may tempt the tenants to their own injury. Tenants may be so eager to make a bargain with the landlords on favourable terms that they may, not having the one-fourth, borrow it upon comparatively oppressive terms, and find themselves, after a short period, unable to repay it. Under these circumstances, the tenant who provides the one-fourth will be as likely as, if not more likely than, any other man to fall into such a condition as will necessitate the sale of his holding and the placing of the burden on the county. However, I am willing to recognise any disposition on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to make a concession, and to recommend my hon. and learned Friend to adopt the homely plan of "splitting the difference."
 MR. SEXTON : You did it in the Bill of last year.
(9.40.)  MR. SEXTON : This is an Amendment to which the Irish Members feel it their duty to offer as strenuous an opposition as their numbers and the form of the House will allow. I recall the important circumstance that the alteration the Lords have made is not an alteration of anything inserted by the Government in the original Bill as to which it might be pleaded the Government had not carefully considered the point in debate. This Amendment proposes to strike out part of a compromise arrived at in this House after debate. An Irish Member moved an Amendment to the effect that the Land Commission should have some share in the choice of officials, and although there was not a long discussion upon that, its importance was fully recognised; the
 178 179 180
(10.56.)  MR. SEXTON : We wish that the Land Commission should be consulted, but not as a matter of grace. What we wish to secure and what the right hon. Gentleman himself desires might be effected by adopting in this clause language which has been adopted elsewhere more than once in the Bill when the Lord Lieutenant has to act on the initiative of the Land Commission. I would suggest that the words "such persons as the Lord Lieutenant and the Treasury on the Report of the Land Commission shall determine" should be inserted. That would leave the power of appointing in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant or the Treasury, and would

 MR. SEXTON : The several members?
 MR. SEXTON : The reception of Reports would not mean their consideration. I would rather say "on the Report of the several members of the Commission."
 MR. SEXTON : The right hon. Gentleman stated earlier in the evening that after the Bill left this House he discovered that there was no provision made for appeals from two Commissioners sitting together in the Court of First Instance. There is a difficulty as to the constitution of that Court of Appeal, and it seems to me that it might be got over in one of two ways. It might be provided that where two Land Commissioners sat in the Court of First Instance one of them should be a Purchase Commissioner. That would prevent the possibility of a decision of the two Purchase Commissioners being reviewed on appeal by the three Rent Commissioners. The other method is that which the Attorney

 MR. SEXTON : Of course, we should not consider ourselves justified in raising a Debate upon this, or in putting the House to the trouble of a Division, after
 194
(11.20.)  MR. SEXTON : I admit the force of much the right hon. Gentleman has said, and we are desirous of arriving at an understanding with the Government without a wearisome discussion.
 196
 MR. SEXTON : Surely it is unreasonable to stop the progress of this Bill on such grounds. Why should the whole House be punished for the neglect of the hon. Member?
(12.0.)  MR. SEXTON : In fixing the time for resuming Committee will the right hon. Gentleman put it down for some day when it can be taken at such an hour that there will be some chance of getting it through? Will he give it the first place on the Orders of the Day?
 MR. SEXTON : What we complain of is that the tenant will not be able to know his true position before he has bound himself to purchase his holding.
 MR. SEXTON : I think we cannot assent to this without some better explanation. It has relation to a matter upon which a noble Lord in another place proposed a clause so outrageous that the House of Lords would give no countenance to it, and it would seem that the Lord Chancellor for Ireland has drawn up words to effect the object desired in a manner not so likely to excite the ire of the House of Commons. What in effect this will do, this  ex poste facto
 MR. SEXTON : The insertion of these words was the result of a discussion which took place upon the subject. They were intended to meet the case of what would happen in regard to the sinking fund dividends. If you purchase stock and cancel it before the end of the term for which the annuity is payable, you must pay into the sinking fund the sum that would otherwise have had to be paid in dividends on the stock.
 MR. SEXTON : But the second paragraph is worse, for it proposes that when the Land Commission consider they have a right to a holding, they may issue an order declaring the holding to be vested in them. The Land Commission, being in the position of litigants, are to constitute themselves the Court. Surely it is an unalterable principle of law that any person or body having a claim on what is  primâ facie
 MR. SEXTON : I am not sure that I understand this. If a holding is sold in default, a person having a beneficial interest in the guarantee deposit may allow this to go towards making good the default in the annuity. That seems reasonable, but that may prejudice the security in the future.
(7.47.)  MR. SEXTON : I should like to know what is to become of the liability to the guarantee deposit during the period the Land Commission hold the farm. If the tenant or purchaser continues to hold the farm and makes any profit, he can pay the annuity, and there would be no liability to the Guarantee Fund. Suppose the Land Commission make some profit, would it not be equitable to provide that that profit should go towards a reduction of the annuity? I propose to add—
 MR. SEXTON : I fail to understand why this Amendment is made at all. Supposing the Lord Lieutenant should be at liberty to revoke not only the first declaration which he made, but
 157
(6.50.)  MR. SEXTON : It will be convenient now to deal with the question as to the proportions in which the divisions of the money should be made. It was arranged that the county share of the money should be divided into two parts, and that the question of further arrangement should not arise until the large and small farms had taken their full share. Lord Londonderry proposed that instead of waiting for this, 1–25th of the fund should yearly be proportionately divided between the large and small farms. There has been a
 158 "One twenty-fifth of the total amount available for advances under this Act in each county shall in each financial year be deemed to be allocated according to the proportion above mentioned."
 MR. SEXTON : The right hon. Gentleman will remember that I pointed out to him it might be possible to relieve individual purchasers by giving relief in advance. These words "or likely to arise," will give the Lord Lieutenant power to advance an instalment not quite due, but soon to be due, before the legal title comes into operation.
 MR. SEXTON : I suggest the omission of the 1st Sub-section, because so long as you say there is a certain sum to be allocated there will always be a danger of misapprehension, for it may be held that no more can be spent.
 MR. SEXTON : There are two ways of describing the same thing. One is calling it the "1–25th part of the total amount available for advances," and the other is calling it "the annual share of the Guarantee Fund." If you multiply the annual share of the Guarantee Fund by 25, you have the total value of the Guaranteed Stock.
 MR. SEXTON : I had intended to propose a clause providing a method for applying the money, but as we are not to have the money this is useless.
(12.37.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney General for Ireland will say what he thinks of this and the subsequent clauses.
 MR. SEXTON : This is a very important clause. The whole structure of the Labourers' Acts since 1883 has been erected on the basis of voluntary action on the part of the Boards of Guardians. I am very far from saying that Boards of Guardians have always justified the confidence placed in them by law; but I do not think clauses of this kind should be allowed to pass in silence under this clause; the Inspectors of the Department will become the controllers of the rates
 209
 MR. SEXTON : No time is fixed for the payment of the money, and I propose to fix a moderate term—15 years—limiting to that extent the discretion to the Land Commission.
(12.2.)  MR. SEXTON : Clause 2 provides—
 "That the Land Commission before purchasing any bog shall be satisfied that they will ultimately realise by means of the bog an amount sufficient to repay the purchase-money with interest at the rate of 3⅛ per cent. per annum."
 MR. SEXTON : It seems of little use moving Amendments. I should have thought the right hon. Gentleman would have consented to insert a minimum number of years within which the loan should not be recovered. I now move the next Amendment. I presume it is not intended that the Treasury should make a profit out of the transaction; and when the Treasury is fully recouped I propose that the proceeds of the sale shall be divided between the tenants or purchasers who have made the payments in respect of such bog.
(12.22.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I hope the Home Secretary has re-considered the words he used yesterday with reference to the duty of the Public Prosecutor in taking proceedings against the promoters of fraudulent companies. I was astonished to hear the right hon. Gentleman make the statement that the persons who entrusted their money to Directors of companies which turned out fraudulent
 205
 MR. T. M. HEALY : The expression to which I referred just now, as used by the right hon. Gentleman, was "One set of rogues and knaves scarcely less honest than the other." The words were omitted in the  Times Daily News Standard.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I will make it on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Can I make an explanation?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I think the hon. Gentleman would be much better occupied if he left questions of this kind, which do not affect the constituency he represents, to those concerned. Heaven knows we find it difficult enough to deal with the Government without the hon. Member endeavouring to further stiffen their backs against the miserable and impoverished people in the West of Ireland!
(7.9.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : The Lords Amendment Sub-section (d) runs as follows:—
 "Returns shall be published by the Land Commission at the end of each financial year in at least one newpaper circulating in each county setting out the amount (if any) carried to the common fund under the provisions of this sub-section in the preceding year and the class of holdings in respect of which such amount has been so carried."
 MR. T. M. HEALY : May we have some explanation of this?
(7.1.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I agree with the hon. Member for Cavan, and
 159
 MR. T. M. HEALY : It would certainly be a remarkable thing if anything could be gained from the correction now made. The Irish Secretary is taking an unreasonable and inopportune course at present. These words have a high declaratory value, just as had the words in the Act of 1881, defining that the tenant was not to be rented on his own improvements. A great controversy centred round those words; and I regard the words now under discussion as having a similar and as high a declaratory value. The Government attach no value to them, and they set up the judgment of the House of Lords against the judgment of the House of Commons. For my part, until we get a Parliament of our own, I prefer the judgment of the House of Commons. If it is a mere matter of drafting I would like to know something about the paternity of these words. I am really surprised that the Government should put the House to the trouble of a Debate and a Division on this matter, and I would point out that concession on small matters might affect our attitude on matters of greater importance.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : There is something crooked under this which we have not got at. The right hon. Gentleman has given an explanation I cannot understand, and there must be some meaning behind for this  ex poste facto
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Will the right hon. Gentleman say a word upon this?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : From the point of view of a lawyer this is the most amazing proposition I have ever heard. The Sheriff, the most ancient functionary in existence, is to have an order directed to him by whom? By the Land Commission, without legal process of any sort or description, and in a case in which they themselves are litigants. Was there ever since the world began such a proposition? Why is a slur to be thrown on the Court of Queen's Bench, for instance? Have you not got
 167
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Drop the clause.
(7.49.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : This is a regular emergency clause. In some cases the Land Commission have made mistakes; they have lent too much money. If they are to have power to go on in an emergency way, they will put the State to an enormous amount of expense for the purpose of stocking farms. I do not know who brought in this clause, but if it is the Government I agree they are in a difficulty. Suppose the Government make a loss, is the country to suffer? Suppose there is an outrage on a farm—that the tail of a cow is cut off—are the Land Commission to appear before the Grand Jury and claim compensation? If the Land Commission make a bad bargain, in the name of Heaven let them open their eyes to the fact and sell the farm for the best price they can get!
(8.11.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I look upon this as the expiring kick of the Irish landlords. I would suggest to the Government, in regard to the future, that as they have said they would endeavour to bring up words to effect this same purpose, they should do so. Let them bring up some Amendment which will have the effect of preserving the timber on the holdings of the peasantry; they will not find us opposing it. Ireland is almost soaked with water, and the necessity of doing something to keep the trees on the land is very great. The Government should have Inspectors going all over the country and preventing the destruction of timber save where the tenant wants it for firewood, or for "mending his plough or gates," as, I think, an old Statute phrases it. I do not think trees should be allowed to be cut down for the purpose of sale, except with the consent of the land Commission. No doubt it is a strong thing to interfere with a man's liberty, but I think the circumstances would justify us in compelling the tenant—during the 49 years, at any rate—to consult the Land Commission before cutting down timber for the purpose of sale. When these Amendments go back to the Lords I think the Government might well insert some words dealing with this forestry question.
(11.25.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I join in the appeal of my hon. Friend. We have no desire to occupy time in discussion and Division. The Lords want to make a fictitious rent the basis for purchase instead of the actual; rent. The Lords throughout these Amendments have been fighting for their own selfish interests, whereas we are fighting for the cause of half a million of tenants. If you accept this you leave out the real guiding and effective words, which would enable a tenant to know what amount of insurance he would have to pay upon the basis of the actual rent after deducting the abatements made by the landlord.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I imagine the tenant would like to know the basis upon which the bargain is being made, and what he will have to pay as insurance. Is not that the whole point? Yet the Government propose to strike
 197
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Then the advance must be sanctioned in the dark?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I am not ashamed to avow it, and he is.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I have the authority of the Chief Secretary.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : It was suggested by Lord Londonderry.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Then, that enforces my position. It is not a Government Amendment at all, and it, therefore, cannot be defended on the ground that it had an official parentage, or that it is a drafting Amendment, or one
 187 188 Northern Whig employés 189
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I do not know whether the hon. Member's colleague will say the same?
(10.12.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I have never been able to understand why the hon. Member for South Derry (Mr. Lea), whose position, at any rate, is that of a representative of tenant farmers, should
 184 185 A laugh. 186
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I am glad to think they have something to show when they go back to their constituents. We shall have no power over the appointments. Once this Bill passes we shall have no power of criticism. Is that not a terrible state of things? [ Laughter.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Who is responsible for the present Amendments?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : If the right hon. Gentleman gets up to say that this is a light matter, let him give in on the point and restore the Bill to its original form. He says that this Amendment does not do anybody any harm, and
 154
 MR. T. M. HEALY : No.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : The State is the real owner; the landlord is only a tenant after all.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask, as this is a matter affecting the constitutional rights and privileges of this House, whether it is proper for persons out of doors to address certain representations to you, Sir; and whether, if there should be founded upon that for electoral purposes a question by a Member of this House, that would not be a gross irregularity?
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : Order, order!
(4.44.)  MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I think it would be convenient if the Chief Secretary would state to the House generally the course which the Government intend to pursue with regard to the Lords' Amendments. There are some of the Lords' Amendments to which I and my hon. Friends have no strong objection, but there are others to which we are entirely opposed. One of the latter is the long Amendment moved by Lord Waterford, the object of which is already sufficiently met in the Act of 1888. The Amendment moved by Lord Arran is also of a highly contentious character. It would be absurd to enact that a fee-simple owner should be subject to all the conditions of one who is not an owner. How would Lord Arran like to hold his own estates on the terms he suggests for the purchaser? Undoubtedly the title of the tenants will be as indefensible as that of Lord Arran. Lord Londonderry, an ex-Lord Lieutenant, has introduced a very remarkable Amendment on the question of the composition of the staff of the Land Commission. If the Gevernment desired this alteration in the Bill, it would have been more frank on their part to have asked the present Lord Lieutenant to introduce the Amendment. Will the House believe that the entire body of the Land Commissioners reported in favour of the Bill as it left the House of Commons, and the entire
 142
(4.32.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I desire to say a word with reference to the political or party considerations said to be involved. I have never known Party considerations to be imported into such a matter in the way they have been by a letter in this morning's papers and by the remarks of the hon. Member for South Tyrone (Mr. T. W. Russell). Mr. do Cobain's seat is filled as much as is the seat of the hon. Member for South Tyrone. Is it to be suggested that a Member shall be expelled the House because there are a number of ambitious candidates who desire to have his seat? It is the coolest assumption I ever heard of. With regard to the disfranchisement, which now weighs so much with the hon. Member for South Tyrone, there are two Members in Galway Gaol; and has the hon. Member troubled himself about the disfranchisement of Mayo or Cork? The late Member for Aston Manor was in South Africa for two years, and no complaint was made of disfranchisement. I never heard anything more indecent than the suggestion that this House, which is a High Court of Justice, should intervene for the sake of the convenience of certain candidates for a seat which is not vacant.
 MR. JACKSON : That was not the firm with which the contract was made.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : I think there is a little misconception as to this business. The fact is, the Government did not make the contract with the Hansard Union at all. It would have been just as open for any other person or firm, if their tender had been accepted, to have sold their business to the Hansard Union as was done by Messrs. Macrae, Curtice, & Co. At the time the contract was made the Hansard Union was not in existence, and it was, therefore, impossible for anyone to forecast that the contract made with Messrs. Macrae, Curtice, &. Co. would be acquired by the Hansard Union.
 *MR. JACKSON : I am informed that the Board of Inland Revenue has acceded to the request of the company for an additional warehouse which they require for a limited period until other warehouses are completed.
 *THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : The question of the fees charged for admission to Holyrood Palace has been considered, as I promised, in conjunction with the permanent officers of the Office of Works in London and Edinburgh. On the whole, up to the present, the information furnished to me leads me to think that the abolition of the fee would be of very little advantage to any individuals, and might give rise to a system of touts and touting, which would be much more objectionable than the small charge involved in the present system. A proposal for adding another free day would present fewer objections, and is now under consideration.
 MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether the Bushmills Old Distillery Company made an application to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to store whisky temporarily in a warehouse situated in the Market Place, Bushmills; whether he is aware that the warehouses in the distillery are already filled to their utmost capacity; and whether the Commissioners of Inland Revenue have acceded to this request; and, if not, will he explain why?
 MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : This clause is taken from the Public Health (Ireland) Act. The power will be exercised by the Central Authority when the Local Authority do not use the power vested in them. I may say that there is now in the North of Ireland considerable irritation caused by the refusal of the Guardians to act. There is every safeguard. The Inspectors are first to be satisfied, and it is not likely they will take a very violent view in opposition to the Guardians, and the Local Government Board are to be satisfied that there is reasonable ground for overriding the action of the Board of Guardians. I do not suppose that the compulsory powers will be frequently used; but the Guardians, feeling there is this power behind them, will be more inclined to consider representations favourably. The effect will be that of which there has been experience in the working of the Allotments Act in England, where compulsory power has not been used, but the fact of its existence has induced voluntary action. I admit the clause is drastic, but I think it is justified by the precedent in the Public Health Act.
(4.24.)  MR. MACARTNEY : I wish to ask Mr. Speaker whether he has received any communication from any elector or electors in the East Division of Belfast.
 MR. MACARTNEY : I regret that the House cannot agree to the clause, because I think that everyone will suffer if
 169
 MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : I think the House has already recognised the extreme inconvenience of acting on the suggestion of the hon. and learned Member for Longford in asking: for a statement of the views of the Go-
 146
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he has taken, or intends to take, any steps to bring about an arrangement with the Porte for the commutation of the annual payment of £92,800 now due from Cyprus to the creditors of the Porte, and an arrange-with France to pay off the Guaranteed Pour Per Cent. Loan of 1855, and to raise the money on cheaper terms?
 MR. SUMMERS : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he will obtain from the Committee of Head Masters permission to publish their confidential Memorandum on the subject of examinations for the Army; and whether he will in, future, decline to correspond with this Committee on public matters except upon the understanding that the correspondence may, if it is thought necessary, be published?
 MR. SUMMERS : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he will consider the advisability of giving instructions that, in future Returns of the Trade and Navigation of the United Kingdom, galvanised sheets, which constitute a trade by themselves, shall be entered as a separate item instead of being included, as at present, under the heading of "hoops, sheets, and boiler and armour plates"?
 MR. SUMMERS : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether his attention has been called to the scheme of the charity known as the Wesleyan Day School in the Borough of Scarborough, and more particularly to Clause 3 of the scheme, which provides that the balance of the net proceeds of the sale of the school
 "Shall be invested, and the income thereof applied in granting rewards or prizes to deserving children resident in Scarborough who attend a public elementary school, and who are also regular attendants at some Wesleyan Sunday school;"
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, having regard to the outrages recently reported upon European residents at Wusueh and other places in China, whether he will state what measures have been taken for the protection of British residents on the Chinese coast; and what is the present situation in that region?
(11.55.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : The Chancellor of the Exchequer is probably aware that several hon. Members have observations to make on this Bill which are well worthy the attention of the House. I hope if this stage is allowed now to be taken he will take care that an opportunity is given on future stages for those remarks to be made.
 MR. WOODALL  (Hanley) : I understood when the Local Government Bill was passing through the House that the President of the Local Government Board promised to consider this question. I should be glad to learn what the result of that consideration has been.
 DR. CAMERON  (Glasgow, College) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether his attention has been called to the following statement in the  Daily News "The new Chilian cruiser  Presidente Errazuriz
(12.10.)  SIR E. HARLAND  (Belfast, N.) : I recommend the Chancellor of the Exchequer not to accede to the proposed terms. If he does I am sure he will find a complicated balancing of the accounts after the turf has been sold. Those who have bought the turf will claim to have a right to one-half of the amount of the spent bog.
 MR. BARTLEY  (Islington, N.) : Is it a fact that many of the London divisions have over 100,000 population with only one Member?
 Sir G. CAMPBELL : If the 1st subsection is omitted the 25th part disappears altogether.
(7.11.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg to move to add at the end of Subsection (d)—
 "And such Returns shall be laid before Parliament. No advance shall be sanctioned from the common fund till such Return has lain not less than thirty days before both Houses of Parliament. And if within such period of thirty days either House of Parliament passes a resolution objecting to advances from such fund, no advances therefrom shall be sanctioned." 161
 SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN  (Durham, S.E.) : I had given notice of my

 SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN : Then, as there is no Minister present who is instructed to answer the question, I will defer it until to-morrow.
 SIR H. ROSCOE  (Manchester, S.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether the Committee on Colour Vision, appointed by the Royal Society at his suggestion, is about to issue a Report before the end of the present Session?
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : The movements of the Mediterranean Squadron have no connection with the cases referred to. It will be considered whether the Papers can be presented just now with a due regard to the interests concerned.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : It is unfortunately the case that the injudicious proceedings of certain missionaries have aroused the fanatical feelings of the native population in Morocco City and elsewhere and given rise to complaints from the Moorish Government. Her Majesty's Acting Charge d'Affaires has taken steps to warn them of the danger to which they are exposing themselves and others. It would be well if the societies with which these gentlemen and ladies are connected would support the action of Her Majesty's Representative, as he reports that—
 "That it is much to be regretted that the want of tact of a few of the Protestant missionaries in this country should in a great

 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : In a letter from the British Admiral on the China Station, dated Shanghai, May 23, he stated that he had strengthened the force of British vessels in the River Yangtze Kiang, and that four would be stationed there; in addition, there was a German gunboat at Hankow, and three ships of war in the river. Sir John Walsham reported on the 21st ult. that there were nine foreign men-of-war in the river and also a strong naval force at Shanghai on the day following the outbreak of the riot. The Chinese Government appear to be fully alive to the gravity of the situation, and on the first outbreak at Wuhu telegraphed to the Viceroy to take immediate action. In reply to the representations made to them on the part of Her Majesty's Government, they have given assurances that a rigorous investigation would be made into the circumstances attending these anti-foreign riots, and that none of the guilty parties should go unpunished. Two men have been executed at Wuhu, two condemned to death at Wusueh, and several mandarins degraded. Correspondence on the subject will be laid before Parliament as soon as it can be prepared.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON said : I do not suppose that anybody in this country requires to be told that a state of war exists in Chili; but a vessel belonging to a Foreign Power has a right to engage
 127
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : As regards paragraphs 1 and 2, we have received Reports lately relative to the failure of the Naposta Colony, which Mr. Herbert, of Her Majesty's Legation, visited. Many of the colonists had arrived in the capital; some had found work, but many had not. We have not heard of any such grants by France and Spain. There are no funds at the disposal of the Foreign Office for the purpose indicated.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham) : The Secretary of State considers this question is based upon some

 SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether Her Majesty's Government will give facilities to enable me to pass the London County Council (Water Supply, &c.) Bill in the form recommended by the Select Committee?
 SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : The hon. and learned Member for North Longford (Mr. T. M. Healy) forgets that this is not a matter which affects the people of Belfast only, but in reality it affects the taxpayers of the whole Kingdom. I cannot help thinking that the Government have acted very generously.
 *SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : The London County Council have

*(12.17.)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : I crave the indulgence of the House for one moment while I deal with one observation which fell from the hon. Member for Poplar yesterday in moving the reduction of this Vote, and which certainly ought not to be allowed to pass without some notice. The hon. Member is reported to have said—
 "That far too much of the law officers of the Crown was done not by themselves but by others who are commonly called their devils, and so, while the country thought they were getting the opinion of the Attorney General, they were only getting the opinion of a junior member of the Bar." 204
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : In reply to the question of the hon. Member, I have no knowledge whatever of the fact "of the case to which he refers, nor can I state the existing law with regard to licensed victuallers otherwise than by referring the hon. Member to the provisions of the Statutes of 1872 and 1874. If the hon. Member will communicate with me as to the circumstances of any particular case I shall be happy to give him any assistance in my power.
 MR. R. T. REID : I wish to draw attention to one point which the right hon. Gentleman has omitted to answer. Is it not the fact that, when the case came before the Assizes, counsel appearing for the police, in the first instance, offered to withdraw the charge against Mr. Storey on condition of the civil action being abandoned, and that it was only on the counsel for the accused declining to do so that the charge was entirely withdrawn?
 MR. LEA : I beg to move to report Progress. My hon. Friend the Member for South Tyrone and myself have Instructions down on the Paper, but did not expect the Bill to be proceeded with to-night.
 MR. LEA : Will the right hon. Gentleman tell us the effect of this?
 MR. LEA : Yes.
(9.55.)  MR. LEA : There is not, I think, any great difference of opinion. We all agree that the Land Commission ought to be consulted. The hon. Member for West Belfast wants the words "Land Commission" left in, and of
 181
(5.12.)  MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I do not know how far it is desirable to deal with the Amendments in detail. I rather agree with the remarks of the hon. Member on the clause as to waste. It is a matter of considerable difficulty, and I hope the Government will save the House the trouble of further considering it. I also agree with what he said as to the £50 limit. I do not agree with the hon. Member, however, in regard to the appointment of the Land Commission. If the two sets of Commissioners have disagreed upon this point already it will be a bone of contention in the future, and, therefore, I am of opinion that the Government had better keep the matter in its own hands. I always understood that appointments of this nature were made on the responsibility of the Government of the day, and it seems to me that while, of course, they will consider the wishes of the Commissioners, they had better retain the power in their own hands. I hope, too, the right hon. Gentleman will clearly express his opinion as to the Amendment in regard to the power of delegation, because I think it would be very unwise to minimise the effect of that clause.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : The Department have not advised the Home Secretary to attach such a condition to the sale in question, seeing that the proceeds are to be dealt with, as near as possible, within the terms of the original trust, under a scheme which has been approved by the Charity Commissioners.
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford) : Plans for a new school were finally approved on the 5th of June, and the Department have no reason to doubt that the necessary funds will be forthcoming, particularly as, upon a recent poll of the parish, the ratepayers rejected a resolution in favour of a School Board by more than two to one.
 VISCOUNT LYMINGTON  (Devon, South Molton) : I think we ought clearly to understand that some provision will be inserted in the Bill subsequently, in pursuance of which a defaulting tenant may be legally ejected from his holding.
(7.0.)  MR. HUNTER : On looking at the South Wales Consolidation Act I find a circumstance which was not brought to the attention of the Committee. Under
 303
 MR. J. WILSON  (Durham) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the case of Harriet Harlidge, who was tried at the recent Durham Assizes for the murder of George Dixon; whether he is aware that, although the jury returned a verdict of "Manslaughter" without previous intention, the Judge sentenced the prisoner to 20 years' penal servitude, and in so doing stated that the prisoner had intended to take the life of the deceased; and whether he will consider the case with the view to a commutation of the sentence?
 MR. J. WILSON  (Durham) : Before the right hon. Gentleman answers may
 311
 SIR J. GORST : The Secretary of State has received no official information of Mr. Slater's appointment; but, if appointed, he would be duly qualified, being a barrister of upwards of nine years' standing, and an advocate for some years in the High Court of Bombay.
 SIR J. GORST : The Secretary of State is not in possession of information which would enable him to give the Return asked for, nor can he say without communication with the Government of India how far it is possible to procure the information desired, but he will during the recess see what information can be obtained from India, and if the hon. Member will move next Session, all details compatible with the public interest shall be given.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member is now entering upon other items. A reduction has been moved in reference to the salary of the Clerk of the Chamber. Other items may be referred to subsequently, but this must first be disposed of.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That is no matter, they both come under Sub-head A.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : I have laid it down more than once that hon. Gentlemen who propose to discuss the Estimates are bound to bring some intelligence and knowledge of the subject to their consideration. The hon. Member ought to be well aware that the Estimates were prepared months before Lord Romilly's death. The salary will, of course, not be paid subsequent to Lord Romilly's death.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member is trifling with the Committee. The salary will only be paid up to the death of Lord Romilly. The surplus cannot be paid to anyone else or used for any purpose that is not shown on the Estimates.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Undoubtedly it is open to any Member to move a reduction of the Vote, but I have expressed the opinion that in this instance it would he trifling with the Committee to do so, inasmuch as this money cannot be paid.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : I have noticed that there is very great inequality in the work of the County Court Judges. Their functions are not sufficiently supervised, and I am glad, therefore, to hear the Attorney General promise on behalf of the Government to re-arrange the circuits.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! That is not relevant to the Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The salaries of the County Court Judges are not included in this Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The question does not arise on this Vote at all.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It is no doubt true that the question raised by the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer refers rather to what would happen after the question to report Progress has been disposed of, and it may therefore be said to be premature. But I was about to point out, in reference to the Motion to report Progress, that so far as I understood the purport of what the hon. Member intended to discuss, it was difficult to say exactly what was his intention; but it did appear to me that it would probably be out of order, and it would probably save time if I expressly decline to put the Motion to report Progress, in order that we may see what it is the hon. Member desires to bring forward.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The Motion to report Progress has not been put. The
 360
 THE CHAIRMAN : That has nothing to do with the Vote. The hon. Member must confine himself to that.
 MR. HUNTER : I would like to ask the right hon. Gentleman how far he proposes to go to-night? The 11th Vote is for the Law Courts and Law Charges in Scotland, and I should oppose going on with that at this hour.
(12.12.)  DR. TANNER : I think this is a good opportunity to get some assurance from the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Vote in reference to the occurrences at Eastbourne in connection with the Salvation Army.
 DR. TANNER : I understand from the Papers that very few hon. Members will be present next week, and, therefore, I think I am justified in raising these points when there is a comparatively good attendance of Members. I assure the right hon. Gentleman the points I have raised are points that were raised in the Public Accounts Committee.
 DR. TANNER : I will answer the right hon. Gentleman in the words of the First Lord of the Treasury: Duty to the country should be the first and paramount factor in dealing with all matters in Committee of Supply. I am trying to do my duty, and I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to assist me: our united efforts may have results beneficial to the taxpayers.
 DR. TANNER : In respect of the Central Office of the Supreme Court, I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by the amount of the increase, £422.
 DR. TANNER : I think it is high time we received an assurance that
 337
 DR. TANNER : Another item calls for mention under Sub-head (G), the allowance to a Master in Lunacy £500, and allowances to Visitors of Lunatics £1,400. These are altogether on an extravagant scale, and two years ago the matter was under consideration. Really it is so difficult to get these reforms carried out that we must incur the risk of being a little tedious in Committee. I wish to ask if any steps have been taken to give effect to the opinion expressed by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee?
 DR. TANNER : And the result?
 DR. TANNER : But are we to get no assurance on this matter? It is rather an extraordinary state of affairs. I do not wish to be troublesome, but I must press for something more satisfactory, and perhaps I had better move a reduction. I regret to find that the right hon. Gentleman, departing from the courtesy with which he usually replies, will give us no assurance that the recommendations of the Committee will be carried out.
 DR. TANNER : But I wish to avoid delay. The last item was under consideration for seven or eight years, and meanwhile waste of expenditure goes on annually.
(10.15.)  DR. TANNER : I hope satisfactory measures have been taken to prevent those defalcations which in recent years we have had to provide for, and which last year amounted to £1,287 16s. 6d. There is also an item under Sub-head K, Central Office compensations, for which £325 is the amount asked for this year, as against £265 last year. In order to get some satisfactory explanation and assurance, I move the reduction of the Vote by £200.
 DR. TANNER : This generalisation is far from being satisfactory. I feel indignant at the attempt to shuffle out of responsibility by the Treasury, and I must persist in my Motion.
 DR. TANNER : I may point out that this Vote shows a steady annual increase. It is £3,568 as compared with £3,553 last year, and turning to the previous year I find the amount was £3,375. How does this come to pass?
(9.44.)  DR. TANNER : I should like to hear from the Secretary to the Treasury
 333
 DR. TANNER : I want some assurance as to the expenditure on the Central Office of the Supreme Court. How does it come to pass that there is an increase of £422?
 DR. TANNER : I should like to know what are the duties of the Clerk of the Chamber who acts as "Sealer." It seems to me that anyone could go about with a lump of sealing-wax—
 DR. TANNER : I have been to the church in question, and I know that it is attended by a very thin congregation,
 327
 DR. TANNER : Well, he gets £400 a year, and we want to know what he gets it for. We must remember that this is not our own money, but that of the British taxpayer.
 DR. TANNER : I was ruled out of order.
(8.13.)  DR. TANNER : I see that there is a personal allowance to the Sergeant-at-Arms of £96 a year. There is no reason why this should be given, as the gentleman who occupies this post also receives a sum of £300 under the
 323
 DR. TANNER : I always like to have a reason. It seems that the Government regard this as an extraordinary Vote, and the explanation of the right hon. Gentleman shows that I was justified in moving the reduction—because if the item were a rational one, it would not expire on the retirement of the present holder of the office. I will take what the right hon. Gentleman has said as an answer, and will not divide the Committee.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid.) : We ought to get some information on these matters. It is known to the public, and recognised by the House of Commons,
 321
 DR. TANNER : The item I was about to refer to comes first.
 DR. TANNER : Night after night, when the Bill has been reached, it has been postponed without apparent reason. I hope some definite arrangement will be made.
 DR. TANNER : Will the right hon. Gentleman say if these were not the Cork Militia?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether his attention has been directed to the poisoning of six persons, resulting in the death of one, in consequence of having eaten tinned salmon; whether it is a fact that many cases of acute gastric irritation and tin poisoning have been reported from time to time consequent upon the consumption of tinned fish and shell fish (lobster); and whether, having regard to the evidence given in the case referred to by Dr. Arthur P. Luff, an expert, before Dr. Danford Thomas, steps will be taken to inquire into the subject for the protection of the public and the safeguarding of legitimate trade?
 DR. TANNER : But seeing that there has been this case with fatal result, can the right hon. Gentleman see his way to directing an inquiry to set doubts at rest?
 DR. TANNER : This is an important public question. Am I to understand that the Local Government Board think from inquiries made that there is no danger attaching to the use of this tinned fish?
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if it is true that a number of relief works instituted by the Government in West and South Cork will be left unfinished, and that it is proposed to tax the cesspayers of the County of Cork, as suggested by the County Surveyor to the West Riding of the County of Cork, to supply the alleged deficiency; and, if so, which of the works in course of construction will be left unfinished?
 DR. TANNER : I am very pleased to hear the right hon. Gentleman's reply; but may I ask the right hon. Gentleman if he has any knowledge of a letter being addressed by the County Surveyor to the Grand Jury of the West Riding, in which it is suggested that no fewer than 13 relief works will be left unfinished?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the cesspayers of the County, or a portion of the County, of Cork have been condemned to pay £1,000 indemnity to Constable Timothy Courtney, who was severely beaten, and unfortunately lost an eye, in a conflict with a number of drunken Militiamen at Whitegate, County Cork, on the 21st ultimo; and whether it is usual for civilians in any locality to be made responsible for outrage or misdemeanour perpetrated by military?
(8.20.)  DR. CLARK ( Caithness : I wish to draw attention to the fact that the Lord Chancellor's Private Secretary is paid £200 a year for doing the work of the Secretary of Presentations, which office has been abolished.
 DR. CLARK : I am only asking a question. You are giving an extra salary of £200 a year by this Vote to the Private Secretary of the Lord Chancellor. Ordinary Secretaries get £500, but the Private Secretary to the Lord Chancellor receives £200 in addition to £500.
 DR. CLARK : The Clerk of the Crown ought to do the work. He has an office with clerks, and it seems to me that when you are making a change, instead of handing over this £200 a year to a Private Secretary, we should have handed it over to a permanent secretary.
 DR. CLARK : No; you save £300, because you give £200 extra to the Lord Chancellor's secretary.
 DR. CLARK : I am astonished at the speech of the right hon. Gentleman. This is an office that we agreed should be abolished altogether, and now that you have abolished it you are handing over the work to a Private Secretary. I am rather sceptical as to the information the right hon. Gentleman has received in regard to the amount of work that has to be done. However, the present Lord Chancellor may not be long in office, and it is very probable that the noble Lord who follows him will make a change.
 DR. CLARK : I hope my hon. Friend will not press this. Surely he cannot have a more satisfactory answer than he has received; an Act has been passed to give the Government a free hand and they intend to abolish the office. It surely will be wasting time to take a Division.
 DR. CLARK : I understand that for these London Courts Parliament pays nearly £91,000 a year, and that £20,000 is received back in fees. I think we have cause to complain that the Imperial Exchequer should have to pay £70,000 for the London Police Courts, while every other large town in the United Kingdom pays for its own. The only course to adopt is to vote against the charge every year; then, possibly, we may in time get rid of this grievance.
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : There is an understanding that no business should be taken after 1 o'clock. If you, Sir, come in one minute before 1 o'clock after the business has been Supply, at 1 o'clock you leave the Chair, and the House adjourns; but if you come in one minute after 1 you sit until the Orders are gone through. I must say I fail to understand the principle of this. I do not think we should go on after 1 o'clock, and therefore I object to the consideration of this Bill. I beg to move the adjournment of the Debate.
 DR. CLARK : I will not further object if the Government assure us that they will not allow progress to be made with any other Bill after this.
 MR. P. STANHOPE : I was going to suggest that the Lord Chancellor, when appointing County Court Judges (whose salaries are included in this Vote) should suggest the impropriety of such a practice.
(11.21.)  MR. P. STANHOPE  (Wednesbury) : I should like to draw attention to the increasing practice of sons of County Court Judges practising in the Courts over which their fathers preside.
(6.20.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : On behalf of my hon. Friend Sir Charles Forster, I beg formally to move this Amendment, with the view of affording the President of the Board of Trade an opportunity of making some reply.
 MR. P. STANHOPE : I beg to withdraw the Amendment.
 MR. P. STANHOPE : I have an Amendment to move which is not on the Paper, namely, in page 19, line 41, after "bar iron or steel," to leave out the words "exceeding 1 cwt. per bar." The restriction if it be maintained will affect a large proportion of the iron trade.
(5.36.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : The next Amendment is in connection with the transfer of a large number of articles connected with the iron industry from Class B to Class C by the decision of the Committee. This transfer was apparently made because the Committee thought they had made a considerable number of concessions by introducing
 291
 MR. P. STANHOPE : It would be of advantage to these industries if they were put in Class B as damageable articles, but I am quite willing to divide them into two classes, and treat some as damageable and the rest as undamageable.
*(3.15.)  MR. P. STANHOPE : I rise to move—
 "That this House, in view of the dissatisfaction expressed by the trading community throughout the Country, while unwilling to decline to adopt the Report of the Select Committee, is of opinion that its conclusions do not afford a final or equitable settlement of Railway Rates and Charges, and that further Amendments in relief trade are urgently required." 270 271 272 273 274
*(4.15.)  MR. LAFONE  (Southwark, Bermondsey) : I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman who has brought this Motion forward is representing any section of the traders of this country, but it is a fact that at a representative meeting of traders, which was held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, it was decided that, although these Bills might be improved in many respects, yet no steps should be taken that would endanger their passing, seeing that they contain many provisions which would prove beneficial to the trade. No doubt there are certain instances in which the rates and charges have been increased, and it will probably be desirable that they should undergo further consideration; but so far as the question of terminals is concerned, it has been settled, both by the Board of Trade and the joint Committee, and I am afraid that it cannot be re-opened. I think the Committee did not fully appreciate the importance of the question. Speaking generally, I believe that considerable-benefits have been gained by the traders, and particularly by those interested in agricultural pursuits. If the Bills are found to work badly hereafter, an amending Bill can be introduced. Perhaps I ought to point out that although there is a large increase in some of the rates, yet in all cases they are maximum rates, and not the actual rates which the Railway Companies may charge. I believe that the Railway Directors and Manager shave no intention of putting the traders of the country in a worse position than they occupied before. It will be of enormous advantage for the trader to be able to turn to a complete classification and ascertain at once what the rates are and what the carriage of his goods will cost from one station to another. He is unable to do that at present. The only existing classification is the clearing house classification, and no one unacquainted with the details of that classification would be able to find out what he ought to be charged. In future the trader will know precisely what the charges are, and I am satisfied that the
 283
 MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmeath (Mr. Tuite), I beg to ask the. Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the attention of the Local Government Board for Ireland has been drawn to a charge of assault committed by Dr. King, the medical officer of the Delvin Union, on a poor man when in the act of presenting him with a dispensary ticket requiring the doctor's attendance on a member of his family; and what action he proposes to take in the matter?
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : I propose to reply to both questions at the same time. A charge of assault of the nature referred to has been made against the medical officer mentioned, and the Local Government Board have decided to hold a sworn inquiry into the matter. With regard to the second charge, it is not one which comes under the jurisdiction of the Local Government Board, and they see no reason why the inquiry should be extended to that charge. The documentary evidence does not appear to be well founded.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Constabulary Authorities report that it is the case that the Constable Courtney mentioned has been awarded by the Grand Jury of the County Cork £1,000 compensation, to be levied off the county at large, in respect of a serious assault committed on him while in discharge of his duty by Militiamen, resulting in the loss Of his eye. Such serious assaults by military on the police are, I am glad to say, most unusual. Indeed, so far as the Constabulary Authorities are aware, this is the only instance of such an assault calling for compensation under the Grand Jury Acts.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I know nothing of such a letter; but it is evident that if the County Surveyor has made such representations he has written under a misapprehension.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am happy to be in a position to say that it is not the case that a number of relief works in Cork will be left unfinished as suggested in the question. At the present time 21 such works are in progess, and it is not anticipated that more than one or two will be incompleted when relief operations cease, and they will be completed if, in the opinion of the Govern-
 313
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have no ground for doubting that the action of the Grand Jury is legal, but perhaps the hon. Member will be good enough to put his question to my right hon. Friend the Attorney General for Ireland. The matter is altogether outside the jurisdiction of the Executive.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It is very probable that is so. I have no knowledge. The hon. Member for West Belfast says the Militia were from another county, and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that statement.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : My right hon. Friend is not aware of all the circumstances in relation to the Bill. I very greatly regret the delay should have occurred. I sincerely trust the Bill will be passed. No effort will be spared to reduce the controversy that has arisen to the narrowest possible limits. It is quite clear now that it is hopeless to expect to get the Bill through after 12 o'clock; we shall therefore make arrangements by which the Bill may be taken at a time, to allow hon. Members to express their views and take a Division.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : Unfortunately, though a Private Bill it is of a controversial character. There are two or three hon. Members who are opposed to certain parts of it, but I trust they will not press their opposition to an extreme length. They desire an opportunity of expressing their views, and therefore we cannot take the Bill until after 12 o'clock. Subject to getting on with
 372
 MR. BROOKFIELD : Has the right hon. Gentleman any objection to say whether he has received an official representation from the Mayor on the subject of the dangers apprehended next Sunday, and, if so, what reply has been sent?
 MR. BROOKFIELD  (Sussex, Rye) : On behalf of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Eastbourne Division
 316
(9.15.)  MR. A. O'CONNOR : I would ask the attention of the Financial Secretary to the particulars given in reference to the clerical staff in some of these Departments. Reductions, we are informed, are to be made as vacancies occur. Among the officers of the Lords Justices of Appeal here is a principal clerk, receiving a salary of £600, and this appointment is to be filled on the next vacancy with an officer at the reduced salary of £400, an admission that a third of the salary hitherto paid is unnecessary. Then a junior, at £200, is to be abolished on the next vacancy arising. Then, further on, I find the present salary of the official solicitor to the Supreme Court is to be reduced when the vacancy arises, and in the central office of the Supreme Court the office of Clerk of Enrolments is to be abolished at the next vacancy.
 MR. A. O'CONNOR : I am dealing with the items as they appear on the Estimate. Then the additional salary to a Master of the Supreme Court, who acts as Registrar of acknowledgments by married women, is to cease with the next vacancy in the office. Then the 14 first class clerks in the central office of the Supreme Court are to be ultimately reduced to 10, and 35 second class clerks are to be reduced to 28. It is true that the third class clerks will be increased from 25 to 35, but on the
 328 329
 MR. A. O'CONNOR : On a point of order, may I remind the Committee that on a previous occasion it was ascertained that, instead of there being four Official Referees, there were, in fact, only three. The Government submitted to a reduction of the Estimate by £1,500 on the ground that that sum was admittedly not required. Therefore, I ask you, Sir, whether it is not open to any Member of the Committee, on finding that an office has been abolished on the death of the holder, to move the reduction of the Vote by the amount of the salary formerly paid?
 MR. A. O'CONNOR  (Donegal, E.) : I shall vote for this reduction for the reason that I think this is one of a considerable number of appointments in connection with the Supreme Court of Judicature that are unnecessary, and as to which men are paid large salaries for merely nominal work. As an illustration of what I mean I would refer to the post of Sergeant-at-Arms. Only a few weeks ago, Mr. Justice Chitty being called on to commit some one for an offence, inquired whether this officer any longer existed, for he had not heard of him for many years. A formal inquiry had to be addressed to the Lord Chancellor to find out whether such an officer still existed. Subsequently, Mr. Justice Chitty, in open Court, stated as an interesting fact that there was such an official. This Vote is different from the rest of the Civil Service Estimates. It is the result of a long system of personal patronage in the hands of the Judges. No doubt the system has been considerably pruned and reduced of late years, but I cannot help thinking it will bear still further pruning. And I would point out that if we can economise on this Vote by doing away with unnecessary offices, we shall probably be able to find money for an additional Judge who, in the opinion of many persons, is very urgently required to prevent accumulation of arrears in the Courts. For this reason I will join in the Motion to reduce the Vote by the salary of the office of Clerk of the Chamber. If the Motion were carried I do not suppose that the gentleman who occupies this particular office would suffer. I suppose he would still be employed in doing some sort of work.
 MR. SPEAKER  stated that he thought the Ayes had it; but on his decision being challenged, it appeared to Mr. Speaker that the Division was frivolously claimed, and he directed the Noes to stand up in their places; whereupon,
 304 See
 *MR. SPEAKER : These remarks are not in order on the present Amendment, but at the same time, of course, such observations can be made with the indulgence of the House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member must confine his remarks to the Amendment.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I have warned the hon. Gentleman that he must conduct himself according to the usages of this House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Gentleman is not keeping to the question.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Does the hon. Gentleman withdraw his objection?
(6.45.)  MR. ARTHUR WILLIAMS  (Glamorgan, S.) : The hon. Member for Preston has said that the proposed division would have amounted to a serious loss to the Great Western, but I contend that there would not have been a loss, it would only have been a reduction of their advantage. In 1855 the Great Western Company took possession of the South Wales system, and from that time to this the traffic in that part of the country has been yearly growing in
 301
 MR. PICKARD : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether a similar Return has not been granted in relation to another class of labour, and is there more difficulty in this case?
 MR. PICKARD : But will the right hon. Gentleman give me the reason for refusing such a Return?
 MR. PICKARD  (York, W. R., Normanton) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will grant a Return stating the ages of persons working underground in mines under the Coal Mines Regulation Act, above 16 and under 21 years of age, and the nature of their work?
 MR. PARNELL : I do not desire to move a reduction.
(1.0.)  MR. PARNELL : I think the right hon. Gentleman is mistaken. Mr. Redmond assured me that he made the strongest possible remonstrances to the prison officials, and gave the object and character of the business on which he wished to consult Daly.
 MR. PARNELL : I regret very much that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby has intervened in this discussion to prevent me from bringing before the Committee in a satisfactory way the very serious matters to which it will be my duty to draw attention when this Vote is discussed. I cannot see that it is my duty to make my statement at this late hour. The right hon. Member for Derby has stated that he cannot see any reason why the Vote should not now be proceeded with. I can see reasons why the right hon. Gentleman should not wish the Vote to be taken in the daytime, and why he should desire that it should be taken at an hour when the discussion cannot be fully reported.
 358
 MR. PARNELL  (Cork) : When the 12 o'clock Rule was suspended the Government undertook not to proceed with any Irish Votes after 12 o'clock. Although this particular Vote is not an Irish Vote, there is an Irish question of considerable importance which I wish to raise upon it, and I trust that as that question must give rise to a discussion of considerable length, the Government will consent to postpone the Vote, so that I and my friends may have an opportunity of putting our views before the Committee at a time when they can be fairly considered and understood.
(12.25.)  MR. PARNELL : I regret that I should have to proceed when it is quite impossible that I can go into the very important subject it will be necessary for me to bring before the Committee, but there is a preliminary portion of it which I may perhaps deal with, and in doing so I shall address myself to the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary. It is in reference to the prisoner John Daly. The hon. Gentleman will remember that he recently received a letter from a Member of this House, Mr. John Redmond, the Member for North Wexford, asking his permission to hold a private interview of a professional character with John Daly in Portland Prison, an interview as professional adviser. It appears that in relation to the case of John Daly and the justice of his conviction fresh information—fresh evidence—had been received in the shape of a very important statement made by Alderman Manton, of Birmingham, on the authority of the Police Superintendent of that district, and the statement was of such a character as to render it necessary or desirable, before bringing the case of John Daly before the House of Commons, and even before bringing it before the Home Secretary, that somebody should have an interview of a private character with this prisoner to obtain from him certain information with regard to the identity of an unknown
 361 362
(12.40.)  MR. PARNELL : I think the right hon. Gentleman must be under some misapprehension. As I understand the facts of the case from my hon. Friend, Daly did apply to the prison authorities to be permitted to see his legal adviser, Mr. John Redmond, upon his own (Daly's) legal business, and Mr. John Redmond wrote to the right hon. Gentleman stating that
 364
(12.20.)  MR. PARNELL : On the point of order, Sir, I submit to you that the question of the right hon. Gentleman is premature; no question of order can arise until I have infringed a Rule of Order, or until any hon. Member considers I have infringed a Rule of Order. I did not say that I intended to discuss the conduct of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby as Home Secretary; I said I proposed to refer to circumstances in connection with a
 359
 MR. PARNELL : A professional interview.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : My attention has been called to the evidence and the remarks of the Judge at the trial at the Suffolk Assizes to which reference is made in the question. I do not propose that the Local Government Board should intervene at the inquiry which, it is stated, is to be held by the Board of Guardians of the Risbridge Union, but when that inquiry has been held the Board will consider what course it will be necessary for them to take in the matter.
 *MR. RITCHIE : It is impossible for me to say that. As I have said, only one case of poisoning by such fish is known to the Local Government Board; but obviously it is impossible for me to say there is no danger in the use of such provisions.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I have received a copy of the depositions in this case. I understand that the jury found that the deceased died from the effects of an irritant poison in the shape of ptomaines, probably conveyed in tinned salmon eaten by the deceased. Cases of poisoning by shell fish have from time to time been recorded, but cases of poisoning by other fish are rare, and only one instance of poisoning by such other fish, tinned, is known to the Local Government Board. The evidence given by Dr. Luff is to the effect that he did not detect ptomaines in any of the articles sent to him, which included another tin of salmon procured from the same shop. The experience of the Department is that cases of poisoning of this sort are not in any way special to fish or to tinned
 315
 *MR. RITCHIE : I can assure the hon. Member that this subject has been repeatedly under inquiry by the Local Government Board, and most careful inquiries are constantly being made.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam) : My hon. Friend's object is undoubtedly desirable, but the matter is somewhat complicated, and I will give it careful attention, with a view to ascertain what can be done towards obtaining an approximate comparison.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam) : A start has been made in that direction in some of the larger stations. I will give the hon. Member details on Report.
 MR. QUILTER  (Suffolk, Sudbury) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether his attention has been called to the evidence and the Judge's remarks at the trial of John and Sarah Starling, of Cowlinge, at the Suffolk Assizes on July 15, for the manslaughter of their daughter; and whether he intends that the Local Government Board should be represented at the inquiry which is to be held by the Board of Guardians of the Risbridge Union?
(4.55.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I understand from the President of the Board of Trade, that he is prepared to except the North Wales lines from Scale 2, Class A.
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : In reference to the next Amendment that stands in my name, I will appeal to the Members of the Committee to state their views respecting the schedule of Class A. I am prepared to withdraw my Amendments as to terminals if the right hon. Gentleman consents to accept those on Class A.
(4.38.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move the first Amendment standing in my name, and I think it will save the time of the House if I mention the Amendments which my Colleagues and I especially desire the right hon. Gentleman to accept. The first is the exclusion of the Welsh Railways from Scale 1, Class A; the second is their exclusion from Scale 1, Class B; and the third is that which relates to terminals. If the right hon. Gentleman accepts these, we are prepared to withdraw the rest of our Amendments. This is a Bill of very great importance. It will injuriously
 284
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : Will the right hon. Gentleman extend that to Class A?
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE (Carnarvon, &c.) : I feel bound to say that unless concessions which will meet the views of the slate trade in Wales are obtained from the President of the Board of Trade, it will be my duty to propose certain Amendments which stand in my name. We strongly object to the present principle of classification, and also to the high terminal charges.
 MR. CRAWFORD (Lanark, N.E.) : One behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for West Edinburgh (M. Buchanan), I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India when the Explanatory Memorandum of the East India Accounts will be circulated?
 MR. CRAWFORD : May I ask the Lord Advocate when the Report of the Scotch Education Department will be in the hands of Members, and will the Vote for Scotland be taken before we have the Report?
 MR. D. CRAWFORD : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the Secretary of State is aware that Mr. Slater, a junior barrister, has been appointed by the Bombay Government to act as Chief Residency Magistrate at Bombay; and whether Mr. Slater is duly qualified, according to the regulations, to hold this appointment?
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Merionethshire (Mr. T. Ellis), I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he can state the reason for withdrawing the concession made to antiquarians, of giving them, free of charge, a search order to examine unregistered wills in district registries; and whether the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury can re-consider their decision, and again grant this privilege to antiquarians and literary men?
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I approve of this Amendment, but I cannot regard it as a concession of any importance, unless a later Amendment which stands in my name is also accepted. The Amendment embodies what is known in the trade as the St. Petersburgh standard, which is, no doubt, a fair standard. The proposal will only operate if timber is carried by measurement weight, and it becomes absolutely useless if by other clauses of the Bill you compel traders to consign timber by machine weight.
(5.10.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : I think a serious injustice will be caused by the
 288 "All timber requiring two or more wagons for conveyance mast in all cases be charged at measurement weight with a minimum charge as for one ton per wagon, whether carrying part of the load, or used as a safety wagon only."
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I presume the right hon. Gentleman will propose his Amendment.
(5.52.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : The proposal I have now to make is intended to give substantial effect to the proposal made by the hon. Member for South Islington (Sir A. Rollit) a little while ago. This Bill contains two classes of rates for timber, one class applicable to timber, the weight of which is ascertained
 294
(11.52.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : I shall be glad if the Home Secretary will inform the Committee to what extent female warders have been supplied at police stations where women are detained at night?
(11.35.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : I wish to ask the Home Secretary what
 353
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I think I am entitled to fuller information with regard to the appointment of female warders. The number provided for in this Estimate is exactly the same as in last year's Estimate. I want to know are there female attendants at police stations where women are detained at night? If so, what is the expense?
 MR. PICKERSGILL : But women prisoners are not detained at Police Courts at night, are they?
(10.2.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I put down a notice of reduction of Sub-head F, but I believe it will not be necessary to move the reduction, or indeed to detain the Committee more than a minute or two, as the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury has very courteously informed me he will be able to give a favourable reply in regard to the particular mischief against which my Amendment is directed. But I do desire to point to the very gross delay which has occurred in dealing with an exceedingly lax disposition of public money. In this Vote there is an item of £3,000 for the Scrivener of the Chancery Registrar's Office. Tear after year £3,000 has been shovelled out to the officer of that Department, and no kind of account rendered by him as to the way he has disposed of it. We do not know how much is retained by this gentleman—I do not say corruptly—for his own remuneration, and how much actually reaches the hands of the very poor class of law writers, who probably do a good deal of the work for which this money is voted. I rely upon the statement which the right hon. Gentleman has made that the system will be altered, but I think I am justified in calling attention to the extraordinary delay which has occurred in dealing with what is now admitted to be a great mischief. In 1884 the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Treasury called attention to this matter, and in January, 1890, a Committee reported to the Lord Chancellor. That distinguished functionary knew in January, 1890, of this scandalously lax disposition of public money, and yet it appears that more than a year afterwards, namely, in February, 1891, the same lax system was continued. I think some explanation should be given by the right hon. Gentleman of that delay, especially as its seems to reflect somewhat on the care with which the Lord Chancellor discharges his duty.
 *SIR E. J. REED  (Cardiff) : I hope the spirit of conciliation which has been shown by the right hon. Gentlemen will enable him to arrive at such a conclusion with regard to these short distance terminals as will give general satisfaction. The enormous traffic in minerals in the South Wales district is surely deserving of consideration, and the effect of heavy terminal charges on short lines of railways is a matter deserving of serious consideration.
 MR. LLEWELLYN  (Somerset, N.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he can now give a more favourable reply to the request made early in this year by the inhabitants of Bishop's Sutton, a village in North Somerset, for the establishment of a postal telegraph office; and whether, considering the great inconvenience felt in the neighbourhood owing to present arrangements, he will accept as a guarantee a more reasonable sum than that hitherto demanded?
 MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON  (Tower Hamlets, Stepney) : It was laid down by a learned Judge the other day that the first stock of a company was only the preferred ordinary stock. I hope the right hon. Gentleman wil make it clearly understood that by the stock of the company he means the ordinary stock.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I cannot at present name a day for the purpose. In our opinion, and I think it will also be the wish of the House, it is desirable that we should proceed uninterruptedly with the business of Supply.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The suggestion was made, and I thought it was generally accepted, that the Vote should be taken after Class IV., directly after the Education Votes are taken.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Supply.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I really think the hon. Member is very exigent. There are several Bills on the Paper, including one of my own—the Coinage Bill—as to which it may be said the Government are shillyshallying for exactly the same reason—that we cannot say when they will be taken. I am sure my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary for Ireland is most anxious to pass the Bill, and, there is absolutely no doubt that it will pass; but we cannot make special arrangements for that Bill at present, looking to the other business of the House.
(9.50.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : We have now been on this Vote since 8 o'clock and have not yet reached the only notice of reduction, namely, that in the name of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green (Mr. Pickersgill). I think the time has arrived when I may appeal to hon. Members to let us make real progress with the Vote. If so much time is to be devoted to every sub-head in the Estimates as is being devoted to the sub-heads of this Vote, it is impossible to close the Session in a reasonable time. I make no reproach; but I would appeal to hon. Gentlemen in the interest of the Committee generally to allow us to make Progress.
 MR. GOSCHEN : On his own showing, the hon. Gentleman is keeping other hon. Members from the opportunity of raising important questions in which they are interested. I beg of him to give way and let other hon. Members have a chance.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I think the hon. Member will admit it would be a pity to close our discussion of Supply at this early hour (12.15). The Committee, I feel confident, desire to make progress. The hon. Gentleman suggests that this Vote should be postponed. It is understood that the Votes will be taken in their order, and unless it should be unanimously desired that this particular Vote should be postponed, I must adhere to that arrangement.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I rise to a point of order. I understand that the hon. Member for Cork intends to call attention to matters connected with the administration of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby. I desire to ask you, Sir, whether the hon. Member would be in order in so doing on this Vote? I ask this question because the answer of the Chairman may influence the course which the hon. Member himself proposes to take. If he would not be in order in raising the question, I assume he would not object to the Committee making progress with the Vote.
 MR. GOSCHEN : After what has fallen from the right hon. Gentleman, it is clear that I cannot consent to the postponement of the Vote.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : The Bill is not opposed.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I will agree to postpone this Vote upon the understanding that further progress is made with the remaining Votes.
 MR. GOSCHEN : If there is no protest against the postponement—and I think I may take it that silence gives consent—we will now proceed with Votes 9 and 10.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : We cannot stop Supply.
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : But I must object. If one Member is to be prevented from going on with his Bill other Members should not be permitted.
 MR. ATKINSON : No.
 MR. ATKINSON : I think if the Home Secretary were in prison and his solicitor were trying to get him out, he would consider that legal business enough. I cannot understand the ramifications of his mind which enabled him to decide that this was a case in which
 367
(11.41.)  MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : Having regard to the treatment of the Salvation Army at Eastbourne by the Home Secretary, I cannot have much confidence in the promises of the right hon. Gentleman, and if a Division takes place I shall vote against the Government.
 MR. ATKINSON : Then I beg to oppose the Vote.
 MR. ATKINSON : The remarks that I have made are congratulatory to the House and to the country, that the right hon. Gentleman the present Leader of the Party on the other side—[ Cries of
 MR. ATKINSON : It is a pleasant thing for us to notice now, and it will be a very pleasant thing for the country to see to-morrow, how the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby and the Member for Cork are drifting apart. It seems to me of very little consequence whether we discuss John Daly or any other prisoner; but whether they have been well or ill-treated we know that the hon. Member for Cork has been responsible for the imprisonment of a great number of John Dalys—
 MR. ATKINSON : The hon. Member and the Vice President seem to be under the impression that we have to consider the Railway Companies. One says it will be interfering with the Railway Companies to do this, and the other says it will be detrimental to the Railway Companies to do that. That is not an argument at all. The Bill as it stands is largely detrimental to one of the chief trades of the United Kingdom, and consequently I will do my utmost to prevent it passing.
(6.30.)  MR. ATKINSON : I beg to move the Resolution which stands in my name, namely, that the Third Reading of the Bill be postponed until three months to-day, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept it, or that, at all events, he will shorten the case by accepting my statement with regard to the timber trade. If a Select Committee were appointed it would ascertain the truth of my statement in an hour. I ask the right hon. Gentleman, who is a Member of one of the most talented Governments we have had for many years, not to go on in this task of destroying, wittingly or unwittingly, the timber trade of this country. I have been in that trade for 45 years, and I can myself, of my own personal knowledge, prove that what I say is correct, and I know more about it than all the permanent officials of the Board of Trade put together.
 Mr. ATKINSON  was appointed a Teller for the Noes, but no Member being
 299
 MR. ATKINSON : Well, then, I will make those remarks in the next speech I deliver. I intend to divide the House upon this Motion and upon every other Motion which goes in the same direction.
(4.59.)  MR. ATKINSON : I quite agree with the hon. Member that the concession is acceptable but not sufficient. This I can prove by means of a letter from the witness of whom I spoke, and who is quite willing to give evidence before a Committee. I should like to ask the President of the Board of Trade what authority he has for making a change which will prove ruinous to the great timber trade of this country? If the right hon. Gentleman, as President of the Board of Trade, has a conscience, which I do not believe [ cries of cries of
 MR. ATKINSON : Some time ago, when I had a Bill which I wanted to carry with reference to seamen's votes, I was made to walk 16 times round the Lobbies—20 minutes each time. [ Cries of
 MR. ATKINSON : Yes, I will.
 MR. ATKINSON : There seems to be nothing for me but to divide the House against this Amendment, which I will do.
 MR. ATKINSON : I am afraid that that is not sufficient to meet all the requirements of the case, but I am glad to accept the Amendments indicated by the President of the Board of Trade on account, and as an instalment. Still, I heartily support the Resolution of the hon. Member opposite, because I am determined to prevent the Bills passing by every power I possess. If the timber trade is to be knocked on the head, I think the working men of this country will want to know the reason why. I believe the difficulty could easily be got over. If the President of the Board of Trade would refer the Bills to a Select Committee on Tuesday, I am satisfied that by Wednesday such Committee would arrive at a decision which the House would be prepared to accept. I make this proposition to the right hon. Gentleman. I do not know who the Parliamentary Leader is; we do not appear to have one just now. If the
 280
(3.55.)  MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I was glad to hear the last remark of the right hon. Gentleman, namely, that he was not speaking on behalf of the Government. That will, I hope, set at liberty the 30 Gentlemen who sit on those Benches. In my opinion there are provisions in these Bills which will kill the timber trade of the United Kingdom, and therefore all the right hon. Gentleman's talk about compliment or no compliment to the gentlemen who have sat for 48 days on the Committee must go by the board. They know nothing about the timber trade. I have known the timber trade for 45 years, and I agree with a correspondent of mine who says that rather than the Bills before the House should pass as they stood, it would be better to kick them out altogether.
 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to support this Amendment, on the principle of voting against these Bills from beginning to end.
 MR. ATKINSON : Will the right hon. Gentleman also assent to the elimination of the timber trade?
 MR. COBB : I cannot see anything in the Vote to show what the contract is, or how refreshments are supplied. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will afford us some information on the point?
 MR. COBB : I suppose that if there is no subsidy the Treasury will have some control over the terms of the contract?
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I notice a small item for refreshment contractor. Is this for the contractor who supplies refreshments at the Royal Courts of Justice, and, if not, will the right hon. Gentleman say what are the arrangements for supplying refreshments at the Courts?
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I wish to tender my thanks to the Attorney General for the handsome way in which he has recognised the efforts of the Opposition to reduce the Estimates. At Wisbech I stated that, although we were in a minority, yet, by our pertinacity with regard to the Estimates, we had forced the Government to make considerable reductions, and to waste a little less money than is ordinarily the case with Governments. I wish to thank the hon. Gentleman for having confirmed what I said at Wisbech in this handsome manner.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have received such a representation, and an application for the loan of Metropolitan Police, and in the answer I have just given I have stated generally the purport of my reply.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have been informed that, although there seemed at one time a probability of considerable disturbance at Eastbourne last Sunday, the timely action of the authorities was successful in preventing any serious breach of the peace. I am also informed that excursionists have arrived by train to join in the processions at Eastbourne. Eight of the nine persons committed since last Sunday appear to have come from London. The Watch Committee apprehend further disturbance on Sunday next. The Local Authorities have so far been able, although with some difficulty, to prevent serious disorders at Eastbourne; and I do not think any such emergency has arisen as to call for the intervention of the Metropolitan
 317
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have done so in the answer I have just given.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I can only refer the hon. Member to my answer.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I cannot undertake to grant this Return. I have no right to call upon the owners of every colliery in the Kingdom to furnish me with the details asked for, and it would be difficult in any case to provide the information with any degree of accuracy. In the summary tables of the Census the hon. Member will find some statistics which bear upon his inquiry.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : At present I have only seen a newspaper account of the case. The facts as stated there amount to a very grave case of homicide, and do not disclose any grounds for advising interference with the sentence. I will duly consider any representation that may be made to me on the woman's behalf.
*(12.35.)  MR. MATTHEWS : This question of interviews with prisoners is one which hon. Members sitting below the Gangway opposite brought prominently before the attention of the House at the time of the sitting of the Special Commission. At that time, and perhaps not without reason, they complained of the laxity of the rule. I recollect that they complained that representatives of the  Times 363 bonâ fide
 *MR. MATTHEWS : Not at that time.
*(12.46.)  MR. MATTHEWS : I do not think I treated the matter in a pedantic spirit when I said that the speech of the hon. Member for Cork was not sufficient to justify the demand. It must be made clear to the prison authorities before they can grant leave that there is some  bonâ fide
 *MR. MATTHEWS : No.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I really heard the observations of the hon. Member for Peterborough so imperfectly that I do not feel able to answer him. The function of the police is not to play the part of public prosecutors, nor is it my function. The police are always glad to aid in bringing offenders against the law to justice when their offences are brought to their knowledge. I did not hear what the facts of this case are—
 MR. MATTHEWS : There is no necessity for that. If the hon. Gentleman will lay the facts of the case before the superintendent of the district, I have no doubt that that officer will assist the hon. Gentleman in bringing the offenders to justice.
 *MR. MATTHEWS : From the speech of the hon. Member for West Belfast, I now gather, with some difficulty, that Mr. Redmond desires to see John Daly in order to ascertain from information Daly can give, coupled with subsequent information to be obtained elsewhere, whether he can make out a case for showing that Daly's conviction was wrong. That, I think, would come within the rule I have mentioned, and I think that Daly should see Mr. Redmond outside the hearing of the prison officials.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Mr. Redmond never made any statement to the Governor, so far as I know.
 MR. MATTHEWS : No.
 MR. MATTHEWS : We have had female warders at Police Courts since December, 1888.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I have promised that during the Recess I will endeavour to ascertain whether it is possible to re-arrange the Metropolitan Police Courts. It would be inconvenient to displace the old Courts and so interfere with the habits of the people who live near them. I remember I had a Departmental Committee which proposed to do away with Marlborough Street Police Court, but immediately the proposal was made there was a great outcry. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green will see from the Estimates that provision has been made for one female warder for each of the 14 Metropolitan Police Courts.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : The question of guarantees for telegraph offices is at present under the consideration of the Treasury, and I am not, therefore, in a position to give the hon. Member any further information than that which was communicated to him a short time ago by letter. I shall be very glad, if I find myself in a position, to accept reduced guarantees. Perhaps my hon. Friend may not have observed that the Post Office Bill which has passed this House will enable a Rural Sanitary Authority to become the guarantors in these cases.
 MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : Is the item "allowance for subsistence of Judges" separate from the travelling allowance? I should like to know on what principle the travelling expenses are paid.
 MR. ROBY : And that covers travelling and subsistence?
 SIR H. VIVIAN  (Swansea, District) : We are labouring under what we feel to be a very great grievance in this case, which is not, I am sorry to say, altogether met by the proposal of the right hon. Gentleman. At the same time, the President of the Board of Trade has probably gone as far as he possibly can to meet our wishes. At the same time it must be clearly understood that we do not accept this as final, and that we shall be precluded from endeavouring to obtain redress. I understand that we shall not be hung up for three years, and that if the Great Western Company become prosperous we shall have the advantage of this clause. I am glad the right hon. Gentleman accepts that interpretation, and I think that is a very important Amendment indeed. Then I understand the clause applies to the share capital—to the dividends upon the share capital of the company. Again, I have the assent of the right hon. Gentleman to my interpretation. The paid-up capital might be strained into meaning debentures and various other things. Do I understand it to mean  bonâ fide
 SIR H. VIVIAN : I shall not move the Amendment standing in my name.
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India a question, of which I have given him private notice, if he can now state whether the India Office will grant the return on the Paper relating to expenditure incurred since 1882 beyond the north-west frontier of India; or what information on the subject can be supplied, if not in the precise form suggested by the Return, then in some other form calculated to bring out the salient facts of the case.
 MR. BRYCE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can state what progress has
 320
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : This item affords a good illustration of the way in which work is done in these Departments. We find that the time of a man who gets £300 a year is so little taken up with the duties of his office that he can take upon himself the duties of another office for another £200 a year. This shows that formerly we had two men doing the work that ought to have been done by one. There is a Clerk of the Chamber, and I have no doubt if we went to the secretary to the Lord Chancellor and offered him the duties of that post for another £200 a year, he would accept them. I have not the least doubt that all round in these offices one man could do the work now done by three or four people.
(5.4.)  MR. CRAIG  (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) : I would suggest that "cubic" should be inserted before "feet."
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether his attention has been called to the alleged grievance of Robert Colclough, for 28 years employed in the Ordnance Store Department, Woolwich, and a foreman since 1878, who was reduced in 1888 in consequence of a mistake made when he was absent through illness; whether he is aware that this man received sick pay at the rate of 30s. per week, but was afterwards superannuated on the scale due to a labourer on 19s. per week, and that his reduction from foreman to labourer took place 40 days after his pay had ceased; and whether, looking to the long service of this man terminating in a breakdown of his health, the case can be re-considered?
 THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : The Report has been in the hands of the printers for some time, and, I hope, will shortly be ready. I am not responsible for the time when the Vote will be taken.
 MR. TUITE  had also given notice of the following question:—Whether it is the intention of the Local Government Board for Ireland to take any action in response to the communication of the Granard Board of Guardians, in which complaint was made of the conduct of Dr. King, the medical officer of the Union, who deliberately opened a letter addressed to the Chairman, on a matter in which the doctor was himself concerned, and afterwards hid the letter
 310
 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : To a certain extent thanks are due to the Home Secretary for the permission to Mr. Redmond to visit the prisoner. I think my hon. Friend is quite entitled to make a Motion to strike out the Governor's salary, for the action of the Governor of the prison was most unjust, and has caused a vast amount of trouble.
 COLONEL NOLAN : I think the statement of the Home Secretary is a good reason for postponing the Vote in the interest of Public Business. I would point out to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, in the interest of Public Business, it would be far better to go on with some other Vote. We are not yet in possession of all the facts of the case, and I have no doubt that if we have a short postponement, we shall be able to clear up all the facts in the case.
 COLONEL NOLAN : A Motion to reduce the salary would be justified—
*(4.10)  MR. DILLWYN  (Swansea, Town) : The President of the Board of Trade has reminded the House that the legislation with reference to rates and charges did not arise from any action on the part of the Railway Companies. There was a general complaint that the rates were unequal and harsh. The Railway Companies, I believe, were willing and anxious to do what was right, and to bow to the decision of the Board of Trade. The Provisional Order Bills were referred to a Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament, which is admitted on all hands to be an exceptionally good one, and the result has been that we have now a number of Bills under discussion. As a Railway Director I would say we are willing to act loyally by what has been done. I believe that great benefits will result to the traders, and in some respects to the Railway Companies; and it should be remembered that the President of the Board of Trade has expressed his readiness to re-consider the questions of rates on timber and the objections of Welsh traders. It is far better, I think, to settle this long-vexed question at once than to carry it over from year to year. A postponement would only increase the difficulty, and
 282
(10.50.)  MR. ATHERLEY-JONES  (Durham, N.W.) : I rise for the purpose of asking a question or two of the Attorney General with regard to any projected reforms he may have in his mind with reference to County Courts. The period of the Session will not permit, me to go at any length into the question, and I have no intention of doing so. I desire to ask, however, whether the Government have in view any redistribution of the circuits of the County Courts. As has been pointed out, there are many County Courts in which the work is very heavy indeed, while in others the Judges do not sit more than 100 days a year, and it is desirable that an effort should be made in the direction of re-distributing the
 345 346
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am bound by the decisions of the Select Committee. If the Members of the Committee will consent to the omission of the special rates in Class A, in the case of the lines to which the hon. Member refers, I will raise no objection.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I have said to the hon. Member all I can say.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am not prepared to say that.
* (4.40.) SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I do not think I need say very much about this Amendment. The hon. Member proposes to extend the time before the Bill comes into operation. Such a proposal is certainly not to the interest of the traders, and I do not think it is to the interest of the Railway Companies. I cannot undertake to accept any proposal for special terminals for particular lines, the terminals having been fixed by the Committee for application uniformly throughout the country. With regard to excepting certain Welsh lines from the high conveyance rates, I think that some concession may be made on that point.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I have already stated that I am perfectly ready to accept the Amendments on the Paper which affect the timber trade.
*(3.40.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W.) : The hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. P. Stanhope) has stated that he does not wish to retard the progress of the Bills, and the hon. Member who has just sat down, who has a wide knowledge of traders as well as of the Railway Companies, and whose opinion on this and other matters I greatly respect, has remarked that it is desired that the Bills should be passed this Session. But the Amendment of the hon. Member for Wednesbury, if adopted, would infallibly kill the Bills for the present Session. What does the Amendment of the hon. Member say? It says—
 "That this House, in view of the dissatisfaction expressed by the trading community throughout the country, while unwilling to decline to adopt the Report of the Select Committee, is of opinion that its conclusions do not afford a final or equitable settlement of Railway Rates and Charges, and that further Amendments in relief of trade are urgently required." 276 277 278 279
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Yes, at the proper time.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : That is so.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am afraid that I cannot accept the Amendment. The alteration of one article in classification will lead to the alteration of others; indeed, if the House once undertakes to interfere with the classification it would be an endless task. Many hon. Members can hardly be aware of the extraordinary and intricate way in which these matters are mixed up with one another, and hon. Members who move the alterations in classification can hardly be aware themselves of the results to which their action may lead.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : It is impossible to compare iron ore with gold. In dealing with the several ores the Committee have classified them differently.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : We have practically largely reduced the charges for slates by the alterations we have made.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I will consider that in consultation with the Members of the Committee, and if I have their approval, I shall not object to the omission of the words.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : If, instead of "capital stock," the words "capital ordinary stock" are inserted that will meet the difficulty.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The 6 per cent. is the figure fixed by the South Wales Railway Amalgamation Act, and I do not think I can alter it.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : It means the share capital.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I accept this Amendment, on the understanding that it is only consequential, and that I am at liberty to satisfy myself by further inquiry before finally agreeing to it.
*(6.35.)  SIR M. HICKS BEACH : So far as concerns the Amendments of this Bill, I have gone as far as I can to meet the points raised by hon. Members. With regard to the reduced rates in South Wales, the Company lose £2,500 actual receipts in the articles of coal and coke alone, and I am sure the House would not desire to entail a further loss, amounting in the whole to £22,500 a year, on the Welsh line of the Great Western Railway Company, which would result from the immediate reduction of the conveyance rates on this line to the main line scale. I am desirous of meeting
 300
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I must remind the hon. Member that I have already said so. I will, however, agree to the insertion of the word "ordinary."
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : In answer to my hon. Friend, I venture to point out to him and to the House that in the first place I do not really believe that the timber trade will suffer anything under this Bill. As the hon. Member for Aberdeen has already stated, the rates for timber will be lower in future than the present maximum rate. These rates will not come into operation before August, 1892. If, during next Session, those who represent the timber trade feel alarmed, they can easily bring forward a Motion on the subject.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I beg now to move, Sir, that the Bill be read a third time.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Such a provision would involve the alteration of the whole Bill, and for reasons I have already given I cannot consent to the Amendment.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I would remind the House that I have already made two very considerable concessions to the timber trade—one with reference to the charge for a second truck for large timber, and the other that deals, battens, and boards shall be carried at 66 cubic feet to the ton, measurement weight. That is a very considerable concession to foreign timber. I could not lower the classification of this foreign timber alone without acting unfairly to the grower of English timber. After the consideration of the subject by the Board of Trade and by a Select Committee,
 296
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I will look into the matter, but I cannot go further than that at present. Perhaps I may point out that this provision is distinctly more favourable to the South Wales traders than the Act of 1863.
(10.30.)  MR. HALDANE  (Haddington) : I am unable to agree that this is a useless office. I regard it as the nucleus of a reformed land transfer system. I only want to know whether steps are being taken to bring the officials of this office and the Middlesex Registry under the same roof, and what progress is being made?
 MR. HANBURY : The Board of Trade are perfectly justified in standing out against this particular Amendment. As far as I recollect the evidence before the Committee, it was that although the weight of deals, battens, and boards is conventionally treated as 2 tons 10 cwt., it is, as a matter of fact, considerably over 3 tons. In dealing with the Railway Companies, I think it is not fair to assume that this 2 tons 10 cwt. is the real weight, while it is really 3 tons 10 cwt., which the companies are compelled to carry at the lower rate.
 MR. HANBURY : There can be no doubt that it was the impression of the Committee that they were reducing the South Wales rates by 25 per cent. I was somewhat astonished to find the opposition raised to our proposal. If it is a fact that that there is no power under the old Act to charge terminals, that 25 per cent. reduction has not taken place. I think my right hon. friend would do well to bear that fact in mind.
 MR. HANBURY : As far as I am concerned, I have no objection whatever, and I do not think any real damage will accrue to the Railway Companies.
 MR. HANBURY : The language of the Board of Trade was very ambiguous. It was "if and when declared by the trader to be undamageable." All the old difficulties between the Railway Company and the South Staffordshire traders arose on what constituted "damageable" and what "undamageable." If there is one thing more than another which Parliament should try to avoid it is ambiguity and litigation as to the meaning of the language used. Apart from that, the proviso is absolutely nugatory, because it was contended by the counsel for the Railway Company, and I do not think it was denied on the other side, that under the Act of 1854, although a trader declared that certain goods were undamageable, and so got them carried at the cheaper rate, still, if damage actually occurred in transit, the Railway Company might not be held free from liability. That was grossly unfair to the Railway Company. What the Committee, therefore, really did was to take away from the trader the right of declaring the articles in question at "owners' risk" or "undamageable," and so of having them carried at the lower rate, but if carried on the old conditions, as damageable, the Committee left them precisely as they were left by the Board of Trade. What will be the effect of the proposal of the Board of Trade even upon the iron rates of the Railway Companies? The losses of the companies will be considerable. Mr. Findlay, the traffic manager of the London and North-Western, gave the Committee most excellent evidence on this particular point, evidence which, I think, will be absolutely conclusive to the House that the Committee could not have acted otherwise than they have acted. Mr. Findlay showed that the
 293
(5.38.)  MR. HANBURY : This clause constitutes one of the most important Amendments which the Select Committee made on the original proposals of the Board of Trade. Two things weighed with the Committee in taking the articles in question out of one class and putting them in another. In the first place, the articles in Class B are, for the most part, not manufactured articles at all. Class B has such things in it as gypsum, granite, lime in bulk, and so on. It would be ridiculous to put in the same class articles of a manufactured character. But we had a much stronger eason for striking out these articles. All of them stood in the original Schedule of the Board of Trade, both in Class B and in Class C, the difference between the two being that when a trader declared the articles to be undamageable they would go into the cheaper class. There was a serious objection made to that. It was a totally new principle, and one that was applied to no other
 292
 MR. HANBURY : As far as I can see, the Amendment of the hon. Member could very well come in on page 11.
 MR. HANBURY : What the Committee did was to provide that so many feet should go to a ton. I think we must add after "light timber" in line 20, "other than deals, battens, and boards."
(4.50.)  MR. HANBURY : As I understand it, the main objection of the hon. Member is not so much to the terminals as to the special rates on Welsh lines. Surely that would be more properly discussed on a subsequent clause.
(11.32.)  MR. WEBSTER  (St. Pancras, E.) : I should like to say a few words in support of the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for North St. Pancras. The population of St. Pancras numbers, I believe, 300,000; it is a population which, to some extent, works together, and has local interests. May I point out that the persons who find their way into the London Police Courts are not always Londoners; that a good many of them are individuals from the country; and that, consequently, there is a reason for charging the expense on the Imperial Exchequer? The present arrangements for St. Pancras are very inconvenient to those who have from time to time to attend the Police Court; and though there is no district in London which less requires a Court, yet it is necessary to have one, and that Court should be in a central situation. I therefore support the suggestion for a re-arrangement of the existing Courts.
 MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : Will the right hon. Gentleman say what business is to be taken on Monday?
*(9.28.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I fully agree with the hon. and learned Member for Donegal as to the desirability of employing the redundant clerks in one Department to assist in the work of another Department.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : Surely clerks may be transferred from offices where there is not sufficient work for the staff
 331
*(11.28.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON : I wish to call attention to the necessity of a Police Court for Pancras. At the present time the Courts serving that district are situate outside it. Some cases are taken to Highgate, some to the North London Police Court, some to Clerkenwell, and some to Marylebone. All these Courts are excessively inconvenient for the populous portion of St. Pancras. I would suggest that there might be some re-arrangement of the Courts in the West Central District. There are three Courts close together—Bow Street, Marlborough Street, and Westminster—and one of these might be removed
 352
*(10.57.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON : I would urge on the hon. and learned Gentleman the desirability of rearranging the County Court districts in the Metropolis, particularly in the north of London for the convenience of Islington and St. Pancras, where there has been a large increase of population since the present arrangements were made. I am told that it is proposed to establish a County Court at Hampstead, and that a Petition has been presented on the subject. But I would venture to suggest that a Court is much more required in the northern part of St. Pancras.
 MR. T. ELLIS : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether the Education Department, in conjunction with the Department of Science and Art, will issue annually a Report of the progress, condition, inspection, and the possibilities of the development of advanced elementary and higher grade schools in England and Wales?
 MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether the Report of the Education Department
 308
 MR. T. ELLIS : We object to the rates in Class A, and we also object to the terminal station charges. If we do not get a concession as to the rates, we hope we shall be able to do so as to the terminal charges.
(4.44.)  MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, in order to facilitate the speedy passage of this measure, he will make a concession with regard to the exceptions from Class A. I think one of the main objects of the Bill is to protect traders in districts where there is little competition. In places where there is severe competition the rates have been beaten down, but in the outlying districts, and more especially in North and South Wales, where the competition is comparatively small, these high rates will be stereotyped by Parliament. It seems to me that this will defeat one of the main purposes of all
 285
 MR. T. ELLIS : The Amendments which I have to move are the corollary of the concessions already made with regard to the London & North-Western. I beg to move, in page 11, line 30, after the word "Worcester," to insert—
 "(18.) Railways governed by the 'Vale of Llangollen Act, 1859,' and the 'Llangollen and Corwen Act, 1860.' "(19.) Railways governed by the 'Corwen and Bala, and Bala and Dolgelly Acts, 1862.' "(20.) Railways governed by the 'Bala and Festiniog Act, 1873.'"
 MR. T. ROBINSON : I am aware that the right hon. Gentleman has granted concessions; but, still, the whole difficulty with regard to deals, battens, and boards will have to be dealt with. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate the point, for I can assure him that there is a very strong feeling on the part of the trade.
 MR. T. ROBINSON : I would point out to the hon. Member that the Amendment is really in favour of the argument he has been using.
(4.5.)  MR. T. ROBINSON  (Gloucester) : There can be no doubt that this is a very important matter, to which the traders of the country are looking forward with hope. I regret to say that in different parts of the country great dissatisfaction exists in nearly all the important branches of industry. One thing that they very much object to is the terminal charges. With regard to the timber trade, I think something should be done to conciliate that trade. If serious injury is inflicted on the timber trade it will be a very serious thing. For many years the railways have carried timber by measure. They are now to be compelled to carry by weight. ["No!"] Seven million tons of timber are imported into this country every year, and we have the English timber in addition. The timber merchants buy by measure, and I never understood that the Railway Companies have complained that they were required to carry by measure. I think that some concession should be made in this particular case. I would suggest that the Bill should be limited to two or three years. If it is not a success, then there would be an opportunity to make fresh alterations. No advantage is at present taken of the Railway Companies, and the belief of the timber merchants is that if you
 281
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : All Irish Members on both sides of the House are in favour of the Bill, and I think it should be allowed to go on. If progress is not made with it it will be in great danger of being defeated, at any rate for the Session.
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : It will not take the House five minutes to dispose of the Bill. My hon. and learned Friend (Mr. T. M. Healy), who has given great attention to the measure, will be obliged to leave in a day or two
 371
 MR. SEXTON : The right hon. Gentleman, I take it, proposes to proceed with Votes 9 and 10.
(1.15.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : What do the Government intend to do with this Bill?
 MR. SEXTON : When will it be taken?
(12.42.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I have listened with attention to the statement of the hon. Member for Cork and the reply of the Home Secretary, and I feel it my duty to say that not only has a case for a private interview been completely made out, but the right hon. Gentleman has himself admitted it. He has put before the Committee the principle that governs this matter, and the reasons upon which that principle is based. The right hon.
 365 bona fides
 MR. SEXTON : I am going upon the statement of the hon. Member for Cork, who says that Mr. Redmond wrote to the Home Secretary to say he desired an interview upon professional business. Now, surely this is not Mr. Redmond's business as distinct from the prisoner's? The hon. Member for Cork has stated the object of the interview was to discuss matters of evidence having relation to the justice of the prisoner's conviction and I do not think that in common courtesy and common sense, after the hon. Member for Cork has stated on behalf of Mr. Redmond the object with which the application was made, any further statement can be desired.
 366
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether the cesspayers of a county are responsible at law for damage caused in an assault committed by members of Her Majesty's Military Forces; and especially I would ask whether the cesspayers of Cork are responsible for the alleged violence of Militia brought from another part of the country? These were not members of
 314
 MR. SEXTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman say when the Government propose to go forward with the Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill? There has been much shillyshallying with this Bill, and
 319
 MR. SEXTON : Precisely; but we want to know when that will be.
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : What did you let in Soames for?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I would point out that when there is a purely Scotch Bill down, such as the Herring Brand Bill, we Irish Members do not interfere with its progress.
(1.10.)  MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : It would appear that Sub-section I should be amended.
(12.50.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I think we have reason to complain of the attitude of the Government. We ought not to be asked to take the Vote now. Many matters arise in connection with it. Contrast the manner in which Mr. Redmond was treated with the manner in which Mr. Soames was treated, or Inspector Littlechild, or any other gentleman connected with the prosecution before the Parnell or Special Commission. No one who takes up this Blue Book which deals with the treatment of these prisoners can fail to be struck with the facility afforded to the  Times' Times' 368 Times Times'
 THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY, WAR DEPARTMENT (Mr. BRODRICK,  Surrey, Guildford) : In reply to this question, I have to say that Robert Colclough, of the Ordnance Store Department, Woolwich, was not reduced in grade for any mistake made during his absence from illness, but on account of long proved inefficiency and carelessness as a foreman, for which he had been reported before his illness. Under all the circumstances, it was an act of mercy to give this man the benefit of the doubt, and not to dismiss him altogether, as his conduct would have justified.
 MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : Will the right hon. Gentleman say when the Vote for £110,000 for the Grant to Scotland will be taken?
 MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : I hope the hon. Member for Wednesbury will not press his Motion, because, although it does not profess to be hostile to the Bill, yet the House could not logically pass the measure if it accepted the Motion. I wish to give one reason which is conclusive to my mind why the House should pass these Bills. Prior to the year 1885 I should probably have been of a different opinion. When in 1884 the Railway Companies introduced Bills with powers to impose terminal charges, such Bills, owing to the opposition of the traders, were thrown out; but the decision in Hall's case in 1885 altered that state of things. By that decision it was held that the railways are entitled to charge terminals in addition to the maximum charge, and the result is that the Railway Companies are allowed to charge any sum they please. I, therefore, gladly accept such limitations upon the power of the Railway Companies to make charges as are contained in the Bill. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member will withdraw his Motion.
 MR. HUNTER : I would like to point out, with regard to the timber trade, that the rates which are given in this Bill are lower than the maximum rates which the companies are at present entitled to charge. That is a circumstance which, I think, ought not to be forgotten.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : There has been no withdrawal of a concession, but attention has been drawn to the existence of the rule that requires the payment of a fee, which rule has not in all cases been acted upon.
 MR. JACKSON : We have no power to do that in cases where the appointment is that of personal clerk to the Judges. Those are the appointments to which reference has been made, and they are to be abolished on the next vacancy.
 MR. JACKSON : I have already stated that the office was abolished on the death of the last holder.
 MR. JACKSON : That vacancy has occurred.
 MR. JACKSON : No.
 MR. JACKSON : I imagine that the sum is for the contractor who supplies refreshments at the office merely.
 MR. JACKSON : That does not come under this sub-head at all, but under Sub-head F, page 220.
 MR. JACKSON : I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be glad to be reminded that this Session we passed an Act for the purpose of enabling us to abolish the office, and to get rid of the salary and expenses on the next vacancy.
 MR. JACKSON : I beg pardon, I have been there and know all about it.
 MR. JACKSON : I beg the hon. Member's pardon. He is quite right. This official has to deal with the question of the livings that are in the gift of the Lord Chancellor. Speaking from my own knowledge, I can say that I know of no officials who are more hardly worked and who do their work more ably than this official. We certainly thought we were making an effective economical arrangement that would be best for the interests of the public. I think we should permit the Lord Chancellor to know something about the management of his own Department.
 MR. JACKSON : We save £500 a year.
 MR. JACKSON : We are effecting a saving.
 MR. JACKSON : There is no charge under the Vote for that.
 MR. JACKSON : The hon. Member will perhaps allow me to answer his question in my own way.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : I will answer the hon. Member's second question first. The hon. Member asks about the salary of the Preacher at the Rolls Chapel—
 MR. JACKSON : I understood the hon. Member for Peterborough to say that he waited for an answer to his two questions. However, in regard to the other officer, I have only to say that the question has been put and answered a great many times, and I do not know that I can give the hon. Member any special details about the duties of the office. It is an office necessary for the establishment; it is filled by a good officer, who is certainly entitled to his salary.
(8.17.)  MR. JACKSON : I hope that it will be satisfactory to the hon. Member if I inform him that this item of charge will come to an end when the next vacancy in the office in question occurs. The officer who holds the post now has held it for some time.
 MR. JACKSON : The explanation is simply this: There have been reductions in the higher appointments and an increase in the lower appointments.
 MR. JACKSON : I believe it has been necessary to get a licence, and this is the cost of it.
 MR. JACKSON : I should have thought it would not have been necessary to give any assurance of the kind. I thought it was well known that the recommendations of the Committee have been taken in detail by the Treasury and dealt with, each item in order. I
 338
 MR. JACKSON : I really do not know.
 MR. JACKSON : I believe the matter has been considered.
(10.10.)  MR. JACKSON : It is a fact that a Committee was appointed, and that this Committee reported to the effect stated by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green. Arrangements have been made by which the present system of having the work done by law stationers will be discontinued, and 40 copyists will be employed. Some preliminary matters are now under consideration, but the Lord Chancellor sanctioned the alteration in April last. It has been necessary to give notice to the law stationers of the termination of the present arrangement, and I understand the new system will come into operation after the Long Vacation.
 MR. LAWRENCE  (Liverpool, Abercromby) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, for the purpose of facilitating comparison between the three countries as to drunkenness, licensing, and criminality in general, he will advise with the Scotch and Irish Departments so that the Annual Police Returns issued by his own and the Scotch and Irish Departments may, in future, be based
 318
 *MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN : As far as I am concerned I shall be perfectly satisfied with that; but I would ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider whether he cannot reduce the 6 per cent. to 5 per cent., or at any rate, to 5½ per cent. The great traffic in South Wales, especially in Glamorganshire, both in coal and iron, comes down to the coast, but in the case of the iron ore, which goes into the interior for manufacture, the Great Western Company is enabled to earn a large amount of money on the short distances run, in consequence of the terminal charges at both ends. If the Provisional Order is passed, the maximum rate per ton per mile, including the terminals, will be altered from 2s. 1d. and 2s. 6d. to 5s.
 302
 *MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN : Payments out of the stock of a company must include payments out of the debenture stock, and if that be so, the ordinary stock will get to 8 or 9 per cent. before any relief is given. It has always been held by the Railway Companies that the whole stock of a company must necessarily earn 6 per cent. before any dividends can be paid.
 *MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN : I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name. As far as I can understand the system of classification, everything that comes from the earth in a natural condition, which is not in any way manufactured, or which has not been made of great value or damageable by expenditure, is to be placed in the other class with coal and iron ore. Now, we have large zinc and copper mines in Wales, and zinc and copper are sent away to great distances, and if one class of mineral ore is to be in a different classification from another, it will unjustly handicap the industry of mining for that ore. I hope the President of the Board of Trade will see his way be accept the Amendment.
(5.32.)  MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN : Will the right hon. Gentleman consider the next Amendment, with regard to slates, &c.?
 *MR. W. PRITCHARD MORGAN  (Merthyr Tydvil) : I beg to move the Amendment in my name.
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield (Mr. Mundella), I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer on what day the Lords Amendments on the Education Bill will be taken?
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : The arrangement made was that after 12 o'clock no Vote of any consequence should be proceeded with, but I see no reason why the Committee should not enter upon the consideration of this Vote. If the subject which the hon. Member desires to bring forward is one of such importance that the discussion upon it cannot be concluded to-night, Progress can be reported at a later hour. Why should we not discuss the Vote now for a reasonable time? If we are to close the Session at an early date, it is quite plain we must make greater progress with the Votes than we have made lately.
 *SIR A. ROLLIT : I beg now to move the words that originally stood in my name, with the addition of the word "cubic."
 *SIR A. ROLLIT  (Islington, S.) : I must disclaim the slightest desire to obstruct the Bill, but I move the Amendment which stands in my name.
 *SIR A. ROLLIT : I cannot, of course, refer to the evidence, not having been a member of the Joint Committee, and the hon. Member, having been one of the Committee, knows better than I do; but the Railway Companies have always dealt with deals, battens, and boards under the classification to which I have referred.
*(5.58.)  SIR A. ROLLIT : I shall be very glad if the right hon. Gentleman can see his way to accept the Amendment. At the same time, as the right hon. Gentleman has dealt so reasonably with the point raised by my Amendment, I could not see my way to vote against him if he opposed the present Amendment. The timber trade is one of the most important in the country, and there is a very strong feeling on this question. There are two reasons why this revised classification is desired. In the first place, it is the principle of the Board of Trade that there should be an option on the part of consignors between machine weight and measurement weight. But I would suggest to the President of the Board of Trade that the option ostensibly given by the Bill is not a real option, because timber carried by machine weight is placed in a better scale of classification, and hence it must be sent by machine weight. In dealing with deals, battens, and boards, as compared with other timber, a saving is effected because of the facility with which they can be handled. I believe deals and the like are carried for 1s. less a load as compared with other classes of timber. That concession is made by shipowners in various branches of trade, and that is bound to be taken into account. The importation of deals is very great, and the principle of measurement is that which is adopted abroad. To make this change would lead to great disorganisation of trade. The consignment is made by measurement, and altogether the trade would be placed on a materially different footing to what it has been in the past if the change be made as proposed by the Bill.
 MR. MORTON : I am not particular about going to a Division on this Vote now that we have heard the right hon. Gentleman's explanation, but I must say it is an outrageous Vote. The gentleman who gets this £96 receives a salary of £1,500.
(8.0.)  MR. MORTON : I shall go to a Division, because I believe this is a waste of money.
 MR. MORTON : I rise to order. My Motion has reference to the Clerk of the Chamber.
(7.55.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : There are one or two items under subhead A upon which I desire information. First, I would like to know the meaning of the entry "Clerk of the Chamber, who acts as sealer," £400. Then I find Preacher at the Rolls Chapel, £180, and allowance for expenses, £45. I thought the Rolls Chapel was closed. It serves no purpose, for there is scarcely a congregation, and the few persons who attend may find a place of worship very close by. But I wait to hear what is to be said as to these two items, and meantime I formally move a reduction of the Vote by £100, part of the salary of "the Clerk of the Chamber, who acts as sealer."
 MR. MORTON : I am glad to hear it, but still I should like to know from the Attorney General why the office is kept up for the present year. It is, in my opinion, an absolutely useless expenditure. I do not want to bandy words across the floor, it will make no difference to my mind; and as a public man I object to public money being paid away for nothing. I move to reduce the Vote by £225.
 MR. MORTON : I am very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the information, and that is a proof confirming what I say that this is an unnecessary expenditure. I do not wish to deprive the preacher of his salary, let him be transferred elsewhere, say to the East End of London; set him to work with this salary and I will offer no opposition. It is an unnecessary sum we are asked to vote. Can the Attorney General show us any reason why we should pass this Vote? The Financial Secretary is as such one of the most intelligent and best informed Gentlemen on the Government Bench, but upon this subject I suppose he knows nothing and has never been to this chapel—
 MR. MORTON : I have to move a reduction of the Vote in respect to the Preacher at the Rolls Chapel, whose salary and allowances amount to £225. I understood the Rolls Chapel was to be closed, and whether it is closed or not I do not know; but I do know from my own knowledge that the chapel is not required and that this money is wasted. Not far off is the Church of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, and recently the church of the neighbouring parish was
 326
(8.24.)  MR. MORTON : I do not think we have received a satisfactory explanation of this matter. We ought to be told distinctly what this Gentleman does for this £200. This is one of
 325
 MR. MORTON : Under the circumstances, I will not press the matter to a Division.
 MR. MORTON : Would it not be a proper thing to remove the amount at once?
 MR. MORTON : I should like to hear the explanation the Attorney General rose to make just now. After all, we do not know what is going to be done; an Act has been passed to enable something to be done, but we do not know that the Vote will not appear again next year.
 MR. MORTON : That is exactly the answer I got to the question I put on the subject, and, therefore, I want to know what business the item has in the account at all? Lord Romilly died some months ago, and therefore—
 MR. MORTON : I should have thought the Secretary to the Treasury would have at once suggested that the item be struck out. There is an unfortunate practice of making use of money voted under one head to supply a deficiency under another head. I do not desire to detain the Committee unnecessarily; but with the view of settling this question and getting the principal part of this item removed from the Vote, I beg to move—
(9.31.)  MR. MORTON : It appears to me that the transference of clerks from one office to another might be very easily accomplished. I shall be told that one gentleman cannot do another's work. On page 209 I find provision for third-class clerks. Two of these officers receieve fixed salaries of £300, and one receives £260. One of these receives 4s. 8d. per diem as a retired Naval Lieutenant. If a sailor can do a lawyer's work, surely there would be no difficulty in transferring a gentleman from the Chancery Division to the Queen's Bench Division. The other night we were told a sailor was the best man we could have as a Veterinary Inspector. I suppose that now we shall be told that a sailor is the best man we can have to do legal work. Now, I want information as to the Clerk of Enrolments—
 MR. MORTON : I shall do nothing of the sort. The police and the right hon. Gentleman are paid to do this work. After what the Home Secretary has said, I feel it my duty to make my statement over again. My duty is to make
 356
 MR. MORTON : I shall be very glad to repeat my statement.
 MR. MORTON : I beg to move to reduce the salary of the Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police by £500. I am told there is a place in Bond Street where fortunes are told at 10s. a head. The place is run by a syndicate, who have put a young lady named Kennedy in charge of the business, and, I suppose, make a profit. There is a considerable establishment, and a footman is employed. I want to know why the Chief Commissioner or
 355
 MR. MORTON : I suppose that some answer will be given on the points which have been raised. I notice that one Taxing Master gets a salary of £2,000. Why does that gentleman get £500 more than the specified maximum? I should be glad to fall in with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's view, but I agree with my hon. Friend (Dr. Tanner) that we are here to do a certain duty:
 335
 MR. MORTON : Will the salary be reduced on a vacancy occurring?
 MR. MORTON : Then the Magistrates have licensed the Royal Courts of Justice as if the building were an ordinary restaurant in the Strand.
 MR. MORTON : I observe an item under Sub-head H, £47 for a licence for the refreshment contractor at the Law Courts. A short time ago we discussed the question of having a refreshment bar in the Lobby of this House, and whether a licence was necessary in a Royal Palace. May I ask what this new item means? Has it been found necessary to apply to the Magistrate for a refreshment licence?
(10.25.)  MR. MORTON : Here there are two items upon which I ask for a little information. A temporary professional assistant is engaged at 40 guineas a month, and his temporary employment seems to come near a permanent engagement, for he is employed for every month in the year. This I do not quite understand. Then, I find a clerk is in receipt of a salary of £350, while the maximum of the office he holds is set down at £250. The amount now paid is personal to the present holder of the office, but there are far too many of these personal claims; they are unfair to the taxpayers and to the Committee, and it is an absurdity that a maximum should be fixed, and yet officers be in receipt of salaries far in excess of the maximum amount attached to the offices they hold. To get information on these points I move the reduction of the Vote by £200. I am told there is little work for the office to do, yet there is temporary assistance paid for.
 MR. MORTON : Surely some explanation is forthcoming?
 MR. MORTON : I suppose the reduction in the amount of the Vote is due to the changes regarding bankruptcy. What has astonished me is that although the receipts have exceeded £400,000 there has been a loss of £100,000. How can that be explained? I know that the business in the City of London Court is so well managed that it is transacted at a profit. Why should not the other Courts be similarly managed? I have no desire to move the reduction of the Vote.
 MR. MORTON : These charges having gone down for some years I notice are now going up. I hope they will not go up much further. I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman on my right who spoke about land registration. I have taken a great interest in that question, because in the colonies I have seen it carried out to perfection. I should like to see the colonial system adopted in this country, so that you could have your property transferred for a small fee. I do not think that would suit many hon. and learned Gentlemen, but it would be to the advantage of the public. After the statement we have heard from the
 341
 MR. MORTON : I would suggest that Parliament should be asked to transfer the management of these Courts to County Councils and Corporations; then, possibly, a profit would be obtained, as in the City of London.
(11.26.)  MR. MORTON : Is it not on account of the superior management in the City of London Court that the profit arises?
 MR. MORTON : This is one of the Votes I am specially pledged to vote against. I cannot understand why the taxpayers of the country should pay for keeping up the London Courts. Experience has shown that the City Magistrates do the work better than Stipendiaries, and I would suggest to the people of London that they should do away with paid Magistrates. I shall go with my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness into the Lobby against this Vote.
 SIR C. FORSTER  (Walsall) : I beg to second the Amendment. I quite agree with the view of my hon. Friend, that the best course will be to pass the Report, and to hold over the consideration of the question until next Session, when it can be more fully and conveniently discussed.

 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I am afraid that excessive regard is paid to vested rights. It seems to be assumed that when once a man is appointed to an office it is necessary to consider his position tenderly, and that no change can be made. If the circuits can only

 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir JAMES FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : The negotiations are not yet concluded, but there is every reason to hope that a satisfactory arrangement between the two Governments will be arrived at very shortly.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir. J. GORST,  Chatham : I laid the Explanatory Memorandum upon the 
 SIR J. BAILEY  (Hereford) : I think the proposal ought to be considered as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman.
(9.23.)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (SIR R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : I do not demur to the criticisms of the hon. and learned Member, which are based on sound principles, but if he thinks those principles have not been regarded and to a large extent adopted by the Government in relation to these matters, I can assure him he is mistaken. If the hon. and learned Member will compare the Estimates of two or three years ago with the present Estimates, he will find there have been large reductions in the number of clerks and in the public expenditure, and these reductions have been carried out with caution and foresight. Following suggestions made in Debate, a Committee was a short time ago appointed to consider these matters, and this Committee made certain recommendations as to the way in which and the time at which changes in the Central Office should be brought about, and changes in the staff and arrangements have been made in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. If there had been an attempt to affect changes by wholesale reductions or transfers, we should at once have had complaints of inefficiency in the services. I quite agree with the hon. and learned Member that it is possible and desirable that clerks should be transferred from one Department to another Department where assistance is required, but such a transfer can only be made gradually. I heartily sympathise with the hon. and learned Member in his remarks on the delay in the Taxation Department; there are many complaints, and I know they are well founded, but the hon. Member must allow that this is a class

 *SIR R. WEBSTER : No subsidy is given to the contractor, who is the cook at Lincoln's Inn.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Peterborough, I may point out that the position of the City of London Court is unique. It is worked at a profit because so enormous a number of undefended causes come before it. That is the Court in which I have seen from 60 to 100 cases disposed of in an hour. But the Provincial Courts do not get anything like the amount of business that passes through the City of London Court. In many the number of cases dealt with does not exceed 500 in a year, whereas in the City of London Court the number is 30,000 or 40,000. It is impossible to impose on suitors in the country Courts fees which would be

 SIR R. WEBSTER : What I said was that the desirability of doing so should be borne in mind when vacancies occurred.
(11.3.)  SIR R. WEBSTER : I do not deny the importance of this subject, but I hope my hon. Friend will be content with the protest he has made and the answer I have to make. I agree that it would probably be well to revise the scale of costs so as to lower them in cases where the amounts sought to be recovered are very small. It is scarcely fair to compare the expense with the amount recovered, for there is a large amount of work done in connection with unrecovered debts. To the criticisms that have been made with respect to the
 348 349
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Certainly not.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : There is a fixed allowance—3d. per mile by rail, 2s. per mile by road, and an allowance of 21s. per day.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Yes.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Not only are these steps being taken, but arrangements are being made to carry out the work of both offices by the same staff. We have brought in a Bill this Session to enable economonies to be brought about by transferring the fees to the Treasury. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Lord Chancellor is doing all he can to promote the efficiency of the staff. I do not think it will be too large for the work which has to be done.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : The hon. Member is under some misapprehension. Not only is this Vote not increasing, but large reductions have been made in it. During recent years considerable modifications have taken place in the office, so that, whereas between 1880 and 1886 the expense was as much as an average of £5,500, it has, under the re-organistion scheme carried out by the present Lord Chancellor, been reduced to about £3,000 during the last
 340
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Certainly.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : The reason why one of the Taxing Masters receives £2,000 a year is that he held his office before the new rule under which the salaries were reduced came into force.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Certainly.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : Speaking from a knowledge of these appointments extending over 25 years, with one exception all the gentlemen appointed have been practising barristers. I do not say there have not been instances in which Judges have appointed relatives of their own, but I am not aware of any instance in which the duties have been inefficiently performed. Clerks of Assize used to be paid by fees, and the fees amounted to larger sums than the salaries now paid; that is why there is a difference in the salaries. On the Northern Circuit, where the fees amounted to a very large sum, a higher salary was paid than in other cases.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I presume that with the exception of the Northern Circuit the salaries in future will not exceed £800.
(9.57.)  MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : I should like to draw attention to the method of appointing Clerks of Assize. At present, the Judge who happens to go the circuit before a vacancy occurs has the appointment absolutely in his own discretion. The Judge may have a son, or a brother, or a brother-in-law, or some other relative at the Bar whom he appoints. There is no circuit where you could not select from the barristers a fit person to be Clerk of Assize. I think it is very hard on them that some man should be appointed who, perhaps, never had any practice as a barrister. I should be glad if the Attorney General would explain the system of payment.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : This question is a very large one, and I do not apologise for taking part in the discussion. One point has been omitted by the hon. Members who have spoken, and that is the position of the salaries of the Registrars. My hon. Friend near me drew attention to the fees of the County Courts and the high salaries of the Judges. Well, I venture to say that on the whole the County Court Judges are not overpaid, but some of the Registrars are, their income from fees being more than the salaries of the Judges. The County Court work of the country is becoming more important every year. Not a year passes without the passing of fresh legislation, imposing new duties on the County Courts. We have, for instance, now given them work to do in connection with the collection of the tithe: and I am not sure that it would not be a wise economy to increase the salaries of the Judges so that we might get the most competent men for the appointments and might have a claim on them to give up all their time to their official duties.
 347
 MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid.) : I think in the case of dividends fixed at 6 per cent. it would be competent to the Board of Trade to revise the rates. I fail to see any reason why the Great Western Company should be treated in the way proposed by this Bill. The question is whether by increasing the maxima on the South Wales line, the industries of South Wales will be paralysed. When we are revising railway rates, it is hard that South Wales should be charged more than the other lines, the difference being as against South Wales something like 55 per cent. I do not see why in its race with Stafforshire, Lancashire, Yorks, and other mining districts, South Wales should be placed at so great a disadvantage. I can see no reason whatever for continuing the 6 per cent. fixed by the Act of 1864, at the present day. At the time the Act was passed the coalfields of South Wales were not developed, and the railways in that district were practically a speculation.
(11.56.)  SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : The Home Secretary does not appear to intend to answer. I hope the Committee will get some information on the subject. It appears that poor people are prosecuted for this sort of thing, while rich people are not.
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford) : The Blue Book, as a whole, is not issued till August, but many of its parts are distributed much earlier. The Report for the year ending August, 1890, has already been circulated, and the preparation of the remaining Appendices is being proceeded with as expeditiously as possible. The Chief Inspector's Reports sometimes do not come in for six months, and the Appendix dealing with the accounts of School Boards cannot be prepared until the audits for their year, which only ends on September 30, are complete, and these audits are often protracted till late in the spring, so that the hon. Member will see the impossibility of materially accelerating the production of the full Report; but every effort will be made in that direction.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : Some of this information is already contained in the Reports of the Science and Art Department, and I will see what more can be given with the present staff and arrangements; but so far as the Education Department is concerned, there would be a difficulty in differentiating schools on any definite basis, and I do not think much can be done, in the direction suggested, until further progress is made with the organisation of secondary education.
*(10.34.)  SIR W. PLOWDEN  (Wolverhampton, W.) : I wish to draw the attention of the Committee and of the hon. and learned Gentleman in charge of the Vote to the condition of the County Courts of England and Wales, so far as it is disclosed by the Annual Returns sent to us, the last of which was issued about 10 days ago. That Return is not altogether complete, because it does not give information on some points which are really of value, and on which I think information should be given. For instance, it does not tell us the average duration of the cases, nor does it give us the dates of the cases. But, though not absolutely complete, it gives us a large amount of information, and I am bound to say that that information does not lead us to a very happy conclusion. When the Act of 1846, which re-constituted the County Courts, was passed, there was a statement inserted in one of the sections which showed that one of the main reasons for re-construction was the dilatory and expensive character of the working of the Courts in former days. Of course, in the 45 years that have elapsed there must necessarily have been a great improvement in this matter, but still there is room for further improvement, and it is my duty to impress on the hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney General the desirability of enforcing that improvement. The Return recently laid on the Table brings out several points very conspicuously. One is the expensive character of these Courts; another is the small number of days in the year that they sit; and another which must be taken into consideration in connection with the second point is that there
 342 343 344
*(11.14.)  SIR W. PLOWDEN : The Judge to whom I alluded to as having sat only 104 days was the Carmarthen Judge. On that circuit there are only six places of Session. The Taunton Court has no less than 13 Sessional places. It is clear, from a comparison of these two Courts, that it is not the mere difficulty in travelling which interferes with the number of days the Judges sit. If that were so, Taunton would be in a worse position than Carmarthen. But that is not so. Taunton is better than Carmarthen, though hampered with almost double the number of places of sitting. Surely he might occupy his time more fully in the interests of the public.

 MR. E. PEASE : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Her Majesty's Government have received any information concerning a slave trade which has sprung up between small places on the Red Sea Coast north of Suakin to the opposite coast north of Jeddah; and whether, as the slave caravans have to pass through Egyptian territory, Her Majesty's Government will call upon that of Egypt to carry out the terms of the Convention of 1877, which undertakes to prevent such transit of slaves?
 MR. LAWSON : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether he has received a Petition from the Regent's Park Senior Cricket Association, asking for permission to erect a pavilion for refreshments and dressing accommodation on the junior ground; and whether he is aware that the lads playing on the ground have neither latrine, dressing, nor refreshment accommodation; and, if so, whether he will reconsider his decision?
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLTTNKET,  Dublin University) : I have received from the Regent's Park Senior Cricket Association a letter in support of the application made by the caterer who sells refreshments at the existing cricket pavilion for leave to build and work a new one on the junior ground. I shall inquire further into the matter, but at present I incline to think that no such necessity exists as should outweigh the objections sure to be raised by other portions of the public against the setting up of any more buildings in the park. It may, however, be true that additional latrine accommodation ought to be provided. I will look into that question.
 DR. MACDONALD : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he will explain why the district of Ness has only two postal deliveries a week while the other districts have three; and if he can see his way to give all parts of the island equal facilities in this matter?
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WOETLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam) : Undoubtedly, if the Return is granted at all it would be extended over the whole of the country, but I believe that it will be very difficult to obtain the Return asked for, and if obtained would be of a misleading kind.
 MR. SINCLAIR  (Falkirk,  : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the attention of Her Majesty's Government has been frequently called to the delay, by the Turkish Courts at Aleppo, in a case raised by Mrs. Braker, widow of a former British Consul (who had been connected with the Consular service for about 50 years); whether he is aware that a Turkish subject, residing at Aleppo, had forcibly entered into Mrs. Barker's house, and resisted for five or six years all her efforts to regain possession of her property by legal proceedings; whether the communications received allege improper influence being exercised over the local tribunals, in order to delay the hearing of the case; and whether, in view of the fact that two of Her Majesty's Consuls have reported favourably as to the justice of Mrs. Barker's case, and also as to the

 MR. R. T. REID  (Dumfries,  : I wish to ask whether the Leader of the House will say that in his judgment it is necessary that the period should be a fortnight in order to protect the Speaker from further insult? If the right hon. Gentleman says that, I will support the Motion.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order! I do not think the hon. Gentleman is entitled to enter on that subject; it is not under the Vote. The hon. Member is entitled to discuss the treatment of prisoners so far as it relates to the rules. He is also

 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The hon. Member is going beyond the limits which I mentioned in entering
 448
 THE CHAIRMAN : I think that would be going beyond the proper limits of this discussion. The question might possibly be raised on some other Vote, but not upon this.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It would be quite irregular to enter into an argument for more lenient treatment on the ground that there is a claim for a remission of the sentence. However inconvenient it may be to the hon. Member or the Committee, that is a subject which could not be raised here.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The right hon. Gentleman is out of order in entering into a controversy with regard to the circumstances of the trial.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The right hon. Gentleman cannot go into the evidence.
(6.38.)  COLONEL NOLAN : With regard to what has been said as to the prison treatment administered under the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, I can corroborate what the right hon. Gentleman has said, because I remember that in the case of Michael Davitt a large number of hon. Members thought it very hard that he should be subjected to the treatment of an ordinary prisoner, and the right hon. Gentleman allowed him to be exceptionally treated. I think that in the present case it would be advisable to introduce some relaxation of
 455 456
(8.40.)  THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! If the Home Secretary's view is correct that the matter is governed by regulations framed under an Act of Parliament, the discussion is out of order.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. and learned Gentleman must give some proof of his assumption.
 MR. ATHERLBY-JONES : I am going to do that, and I regret that the right hon. Gentleman is not here to assent to my proposition. Under the 9th section of the Prisons Act of 1877 powers which were formerly exercised by the Visiting Justices are exercisable by the Prison Commissioners, under the control and subject to the discretion of the Home Secretary.
 THE CHAIRMAN : This is a matter which cannot be discussed under this Vote, nor, indeed, can the suggestion of the hon. Member for Northamptonshire, that the Home Secretary should issue a Circular as to differential treatment.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Only within the limits of the Prisons Act. This Vote refers to the administration of the prisons.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That is not pertinent to this Vote. What can be arraigned is the administration of prisons by the Prison Commissioners, and their action within the limits the law allows them.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : On the contrary, I shall give my vote for the reduction, in the  bonâ fide
 THE CHAIRMAN : That is a matter which comes under the Scotch Prisons Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! That is not relevant to this Vote.

 SIR R. WEBSTER : I am surprised to hear my hon. and gallant Friend say that the receipt of the Memorial has not been acknowledged. I know that the question of the County Courts in Essex has been receiving attention at the hands of the Lord Chancellor, and that some suggestion has been made for transferring the Courts. I will take care that the matter is further looked into. 4. "That a sum, not exceeding £13,047, be granted to Her Majesty, to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1892, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Police Courts of London and Sheerness."
(1.43.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I think that as this Bill is supported by Irish Members on all sides of the House, it can hardly be called a contentious measure. It has been rendered necessary by the fact that a former Government tried to force on Ireland a system of training teachers which—
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! That is not relevant to the Motion for reporting Progress.
 COLONEL NOLAN : Very well; I will only say I think the hon. Member for South Tyrone ought to be content with taking a Division, and should not then resist the further progress of the Bill.
 THE CHAIRMAN : I must request hon. Members not to persist in these unseemly interruptions.
 MR. BYRON REED : I beg to second that.
 COLONEL NOLAN : I should like to point out that this is the first occasion this Session on which a Bill has been opposed by dilatory Motions, and that these dilatory Motions have been exclusively confined to Conservatives and Liberal Unionists.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : Until the Draft Bill has been formally accepted by the Government of the colony, it would be premature to state the nature of its proposed provisions.
 BARON H. DE WORMS : The tribute was fixed at the value of £92,000 by Her Majesty's late Government in 1881–82 upon Reports of Sir Robert Biddulph made after an investigation of the subject both in Cyprus and at Constantinople. Her Majesty's present Government have had occasion to review the question, and are satisfied that the conclusions of their predecessors were correct, and that there has been no such error as the writer in the Cyprus newspaper imagines. As a matter of fact, only a small part of the five years' receipts were encashed in paper, and full allowance was made as to this in converting the payments into sterling.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. DE WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth) : The late Medical Inspector of Immigrants, now Chief Medical Officer of the Colonial Hospital was succeeded by the present Medical Inspector of Immigrants in July, 1889. The usual Annual Reports as to the condition of the Coolies, both general and medical, have been received for the year 1889. Those for 1890 have not yet been received. The salary, £1,000 a year, of the Medical Inspector of Immigrants is permanently secured; those of the other medical officers are voted annually. There is no reason to apprehend that the Combined Court will not at all times provide whatever salaries Her Majesty's Government think necessary in connection with Coolie immigration.
 DR. TANNER : May I ask whether we are to understand that the overwhelming mass of the prisoners in English gaols belong to the Established Church? The right hon. Gentleman assumes a singularly unfortunate position. If he will only quit his present religious attitude he will, I think, be able to furnish us with some solution of this problem. 485
(9.52.)  DR. TANNER : Under this system of payment by results it is to the interest of chaplains to keep up a large attendance of criminal population in our prisons. Now, I once had the honour of a brief stay in Holloway Prison, and I am bound to say I was fairly comfortable there. During the few weeks of my stay I attended the ministrations of the Protestant clergyman on Sundays, but not once did I have the pleasure of a visit from the chaplain. I do not know if other prisioners were similarly neglected; but, speaking from my own short experience, I may suggest that English chaplains might devote
 482
 DR. TANNER : Are we to understand that the right hon. Gentleman has nothing to say to these prisoners, and that they are not to be cared for?
 DR. TANNER : That is not the point. I would again deprecate the anti-religious position taken up by the right hon. Gentleman.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : May I ask how it was that this man McGrath showed no signs of tuberculosis? I know—and the right hon. Gentleman
 470
 DR. CLARK : If we compare the figures given it will be seen there is a marked distinction in the scale of pay in the two countries in proportion to average number of prisoners. For instance, look at the average in Strange-ways Prison—1,181 prisoners and two first-class chaplains.
 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : Barlinnie Prison shows an average of 740.
 DR. CLARK : If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the Estimates he will find that priests are put down at £200 a year, the salary rising after five years to £250, and after another five years to £300.
(11.6.)  DR. CLARK : I intended to move a reduction of the Vote on other grounds; but we had better take the whole discussion now. Last year I found that first and second-class clerks in England and Scotland had the same salaries. This year I find there has been an increase in the maximum salary of the first-class clerks in English prisons from £190 to £200, and an increase in the maximum salary of the second-class clerks from £130 to £150. Every official in England is paid a higher maximum than in Scotland, and I want to know why the Government have increased the pay of the prison clerks in England and not in Scotland. If the present state of things exists next year we shall certainly take a Division and fight the question out.
 DR. CLARK : I think the right hon. Gentleman might consider this question from another standpoint. On several occasions we have got by ballot a special night for the discussion of these matters, and on each the Government have taken the opportunity away from us. Now this Estimate is to be brought on at 1 o'clock in the morning, and last year it came on at 3 o'clock in the morning. We have some grievances which we want to discuss, and surely it will not be said that this hour in the morning is a convenient time for the purpose. There are only two Scotch Votes left, and I think that under the circumstances the Government might let us have the chance of debating them at a reasonable hour.
(11.20.)  DR. CLARK : I did not want to take two Divisions; but if the Government will not answer my question, I shall be compelled to move a reduction of the Vote by £2,190, the amount involved. If we are treated with silent contempt, the only thing we can do is to make ourselves felt. Surely the Home Secretary or one of the Scottish Law Officers can tell us why this increase has been given to England and not to Scotland.
(11.24.)  DR. CLARK : I expected such an answer from the Government. Next year if the present state of things is then in existence we shall raise the whole question at length. The lower grade clerks have always been on the same footing as similar officials in England, and by next year we hope the Treasury will have acted fairly all round.
(12.0.)  DR. CLARK : I do not expect we shall get much satisfaction out of the present Lord Advocate in relation to these Crown Agents any more than we have had any satisfaction from previous Lord Advocates. Officials of the same character in England and Ireland are permanent officials, and I think the Crown Agent in Scotland ought to be like the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and the other official of the same kind in Ireland. The salary might be re-arranged and fixed at £1,500 or £1,600 a year. I think the present system is a bad one. We have the Crown Solicitor in Scotland acting for the Crown and for half a dozen landlords. I know he acts for several Dukes. It may be that the Crown Solicitor can in these cases act impartially; but the feeling is that the Crown Agent does, in the interest of his other clients, control several matters in relation to Crown business. I on a previous occasion pointed out how the Solicitor for the "Woods and Forests was under suspicion in this respect, and I am sure it is a bad thing that the appointment should be in the private patronage of the Lord Advocate. It is no use taking a Division now, but we must see what can be done under a future Government. The Solicitor should be appointed to give the whole of his time, with a salary proportionate to the work.
 DR. MACDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : Is there any explanation to be given as to the office of election petition appeals?
 DR. MACDONALD : I may point out that there is a Bill affecting the Highlands and Islands on the Paper. It is put down night after night but no progress is made with it, simply because the Lord Advocate does not feel inclined to give way to our views.
 DR. MACDONALD  (ROSS and Cromarty) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it is the intention of the Government to carry out the recommendations of the Western Highlands and Islands Commission as regards lighthouses, by causing lighthouses to be erected at Tiumpan Head and at the entrance to Loch Carlowey, in Lewis; and if he is aware that only a few days ago a large ship went ashore in Broad Bay, Lewis, owing to there being no lighthouse on Tiumpan Head?
 DR. MACDONALD : I beg to ask the Postmaster General, if a petition has been received by Her Majesty's Government from various representative bodies in the island of Lewis, praying that the telegraph system should be extended to the fishing villages of Tolsto, in Stornoway parish, Gravir and Crossbost, in Lochs, and to Shawbost, Brager-Arnol, on the west side of Lewis; and what his intentions are in reference to these petitions?
 MR. F. PARKER  (Oxford, Henley) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he will establish a telegraph office at Lewknor, a village between Tetsworth and Watlington, and where the wire passes the post office, seeing that the postmaster is willing to work the telegraph without remuneration till the receipts cover the expenditure, and the only expense would be connecting the office with the wire outside?
*(10.0.)  MR. HOZIER  (Lanarkshire, S.) : I have no wish whatever to reduce the pay of the English chaplains, but I must say I consider the Scotch chaplains are very much underpaid.
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing) : I am anxious to treat the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers with every consideration, but as their organisation is to be changed, to prevent misunderstandings, all future recruiting must take place under the new and not the old conditions.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : The contract with Mr. Lethbridge for work at the Royal William Victualling Yard, Stone-house, was for a lump sum of £745, including £52 for painting. No authority was given for sub-letting the painting or any part of the work, and it was believed at the time that the painting was being done by the contractor's own men. Further inquiry will be made. The contract being for a lump sum, the rate of wages paid by the contractor to his workmen was not reported to the Admiralty.
 MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade, in view of the fact that within the past few days one of the lightkeepers on Tuscar lost a hand through an accidental explosion of gun cotton, and would have remained some 16 hours without surgical attention but for having been taken off by the  Cephalonia
(12.59.)  MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND : I think that considering the importance of the next Vote, which relates to the Crofter Commission we should now report Progress. I therefore make that Motion.
(11.32.)  MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I wish to get some information with regard to a legal officer whose position is not so well known to us as that of other legal officers. I refer to the Crown Agent. What are his duties, and is he engaged
 496
(11.35.)  MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND : I should like to point out that in other public offices steps have been taken to secure that the official has no private practice, and I would suggest it would be better if the Crown Agent were precluded from engaging in private practice. There is an increasing tendency in Scotland to separate public duties from private work; and as I gather that the holder of this office does not change with a change of Government, it becomes all the more easy to provide that he should confine his attention to the duties of the post.
 MR. A. SUTHERLAND : After what has happened in this House during the last few months, the hon. Member must have a lot of assurance to say he is opposed to denominational education, for he has been assisting the Government to pass a Denominational Bill through for England. Evidently he does not like to apply to Ireland the principle he is willing to apply to Scotland. As the hon. Member for West Bel-

 MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I suppose the Order for the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Bill will be discharged?
 MR. A. DYKE ACLAND  (York, W.R., Rotherham) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether, in view of the omission of the names of many counties which have granted money to technical education under "The Local Taxation Act, 1890," in the list on page 51 of the Report of the Science and Art Department just issued, a new and complete list can be prepared and separately issued?
 MR. A. DYKE ACLAND : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether he will arrange for the insertion in the future Annual Reports of the Education Department of distinguishing marks showing the schools to which special grants have been made under Articles 104 and 105 of the Code, and the amount of these grants?
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : Yes, Sir.
(1.48.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : It is true that there is a system of denominational training college teaching in England, but it is not the system which I desire to see adopted in Ireland, whore I wish to see a more complete one. Two attacks have been made upon this Bill. One is connected with the conduct of public business. It is said that the Government are violating their pledge with regard to contentious business. But the proposal which this Bill embodies has been before the public, and especially the Irish public, for nine months at least, and the Bill has passed its first and second reading without a protest. Therefore, my right hon. Friend the First Lord of the Treasury has naturally considered that it will come under the head of non-contentious business. With regard to the charge that the Government propose to take money out of the Irish Church surplus to endow Roman Catholic Education, nothing of the kind is the case; the Church surplus appears merely as part of the machinery for carrying out the object of the Bill; it will not be one sixpence the poorer at the end of the transaction. The system of giving public money for training colleges is not my system; it was brought into being in 1833 by right hon. Gentlemen opposite, and brought forward in a form in which it is impossible that it can stand. It is open to the House to say it will adhere to the system which has been in operation since 1833, to say "We will put all colleges on an equal footing." All I have attempted to do by this Bill is to carry out a policy that has been urgently pressed upon me. I believe the result of the Bill will be that the Presbyterian colleges will greatly gain instead of losing. At the same time I am bound to admit, from the fact that there is at this period of the Session a large body of Members opposed to the Bill, that it is in their
 518
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Perhaps my hon. Friend will withdraw the Motion, and then I will consent to the Motion that the Chairman do report Progress.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I regret my hon. Friends think it necessary to take the course they appear to be bent upon; but, of course, if they do insist upon it, it will be impossible for the Government to resist. I may say that some of the objections to the Bill are, as I said before, based on a misconception of the provisions of the Bill. The Irish Church Surplus Fund undoubtedly appears in the Bill. It is a Treasury expedient and nothing more, and if the excision of that Treasury expedient from the Bill would facilitate matters I would be prepared to make the alteration. I assure my hon. Friends that that excision would make no difference in the financial result. I have said this by leave of the Committee. It is impossible to resist against a relatively considerable minority, and therefore under the circumstances I with great reluctance consent to the Motion.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I shall put the Bill down for to-morrow, but in face of what has happened, it will be quite impossible to take it after 12 o'clock.
 MR. A. O'CONNOR : If by putting the Committee to the trouble of a Division I could secure anything, I would not hesitate to invite the Home Secretary to walk through the Division Lobby; but as I do not see any chance of securing the object I am aiming at, I ask leave to withdraw my Amendment.
(10.44.)  MR. A. O'CONNOR  (Donegal, E.) : I have no desire to protract these proceedings in Committee, but there is a meritorious body of public servants whose salaries are included in this Vote, and who claim that they have not been fairly treated. I mean the clerical staff of the prisons. When the prisons were taken over by the Government under the Act of 1877 a very considerable change was necessarily made in the clerical staff, and certain regulations were made by an Order in Council in the year 1879. The Prison Commissioners required that the prison clerks should not enter the Service by open competition, but were to be nominated and to possess certain qualifications not generally required. They were required to be of at least 20 years of age, and Sir Edward DuCane, before the Civil Service Commission, two years ago, specially dwelt on the necessity of having men for the prison clerical staff of somewhat higher qualifications than the ordinary clerks in the Civil Service. So here is a special class of Civil servants with special qualifications; and in the Order in Council to which I have referred these prison clerks were led to expect all the advantage of the Civil Service, rising to salaries of £300 or £400 a year. The prison clerks, instead of realising the prospect the Government set before them, find the path of promotion blocked, and themselves stranded, in middle age or advanced life, at salaries of £150 and £200 instead of £300. There has been a distinct breach of faith on the part of the Government, and in equity these clerks have a strong claim to consideration. For reasons into which I now need not enter, I ceased to be a member of the Civil Service Commission; but if I had remained a member, I should have done my best to bring the case of these clerks before the Commission. As a matter of fact, their case was not presented, though they presented Memorials desiring to be heard. The head of the Department (Sir E. DuCane), under
 490
(11.0.)  MR. A. O'CONNOR : I can quite understand how with such officials as the hon. Gentleman (Mr. Stuart Wortley) at the head of the Civil Service, feelings of disgust, of impatience, and of a sense of injustice are very rapidly developing, to the damage of the public interest. The hon. Gentleman has not answered one of the points raised. He has not said anything about the clerks who were in the Service when the Government took over the prisons. He fell back on the alteration in the scales of pay, and said the Government had benefited the clerks through that. He told us how they have raised the maximum. It is perfectly true they have. [Mr. STUART WORTLEY: And also the numbers; there are more than double.] There the hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee, or else he does not understand the facts. The Home Secretary never would have given us the answer the Under Secretary has given us. I never heard any man give an answer with regard to a portion of the Public Service so utterly unworthy of a large-minded Administration as that which has just fallen from the hon. Gentleman. I do hope that for the sake of the Civil Service the Home Secretary will keep his subordinate in check and prevent him creating those feelings of dissatisfaction, discontent, and distrust which speeches such as his are calculated to create. Unless the Government hare got some better answer to give than the flimsy answer we have just had, I shall be under the necessity of dividing the Committee. I beg to move to reduce the Vote by the sum of £1,000 in connection with Item D.
(11.12.)  MR. A. O'CONNOR : At any rate, no one can object to the tone of the right hon. Gentleman; no one can feel that any disposition of resentment will be enkindled by his words. But the right hon. Gentleman touched very lightly—if, indeed, he touched it at all—the point I wished to deal with. You induced a number of men to enter a particular branch of the Service under distinct representations as to prospects and promotion and pay, and when you got them into the Service you would not allow them to leave that particular branch, and you refused to give them the pay you promised them. The Home Secretary says that his predecessor in office had nothing to do with the matter; but the Order in Council says he had. The fees charged by the Civil Service Commissioners in connection with entry into the Service are fixed after consultation by them with the heads of the Civil Departments. Therefore, in the case of these clerks, I maintain that there has been a gross breach of faith.
 MR. A. O'CONNOR  (Donegal, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he will direct the Board of Works, or cause the Railway Company, to remove the obstruction erected by the railway in the Little Brosna River, which now prevents the drainage of the Shinrone drainage district; and whether there are any means of compensating the
 409
 *MR. SPEAKER : It may perhaps relieve the House of some embarrassment if I may be allowed to interpose an expression of my own feelings in the matter in favour of the least period of suspension which is compatible with the feelings of the House. I need not say that I have no vindictive feeling towards the hon. Gentleman; the matter has passed beyond any personal feeling altogether. I respectfully suggest to the House that the hon. Gentleman is at this moment somewhat wanting in self-control, and that a short period of rest will be beneficial to himself and will save the House from any repetition of the cause of complaint. If that be the view of the House, I submit that a week may be substituted for a fortnight.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I must ask the hon. Member to withdraw.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Yes.
 *MR. SPEAKER : There were upon the Paper on the occasion in question several Amendments applicable to several Railway Bills. The first of those Bills after a time came to the stage of Third Reading, and when the hon. Gentleman challenged my decision I asked him whether he had any other hon. Member to act with him as Teller, and, no Teller coming forward, I said that the "Ayes" had it. The Great Western Railway Bill next came before the House, and on the Question that the Bill be now considered, the hon. Member moved to leave out "now" in order to insert the words "this day three months." That was put and negatived. Then came the Great Eastern Railway Bill, and the same thing happened as had occurred with reference to the two previous Bills. I put the Question, and that Bill passed without any demur. There was then the Great Northern Railway Bill, which was exactly of the same character as the other Bills. It was not challenged, but was read a third time and passed. Then came the London and South-Western Railway Bill. I put the Question that the Bill be now read a third time. The hon. Member challenged it, and I thought after what had taken place I might properly employ the Standing Order No. 30 and ask the minority to stand up. The hon. Member stood up alone in his place, and the House was saved the trouble of a Division. The hon. Member complains that in the Journals of the House an entry is made that he had frivolously and vexatiously attempted to divide the House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! I thought it was vexatious, and I put the Standing Order into effect. I have something more to say, and I desire to say it in the hon. Member's presence.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I must recall to the House the circumstances of which the hon. Member complains.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member, in the course of the remarks he has just made, referred to the treatment which he says he has received at my hands for a week past.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I wish to say, in reply, that I will not notice any communication that comes from the hon. Member in his private capacity. I think that any complaints which he has to make against me should be made publicly in this House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The House is aware that there is standing on the Paper in the hon. Member's name a notice of Motion charging me with an offence which I hope is new to me as regards any Member of this House—that of discourtesy. I have been on several occasions during my time in the Chair brought into relations that have been exceedingly unpleasant to me with several hon. Members of this House, but I am not aware that either on their part, and I can certainly say not on my own, have any private relations been established between us other than of a friendly kind. They have distinguished between the person and the office. Now, it is my duty, and a very painful one it is, to read to the House two communications which I have received during the last 48 hours from the hon. Member, and I think that the House will agree with me that a stop must be put to these communications between an hon. Member and the Speaker.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I was away on Saturday on business, and when I came back I found a letter from the hon. Gentleman following a former communication, which was, as I think, so discreditable to the hon. Member and so insulting to myself that I do not think it becoming to read it to the House.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I shall take my stand upon the two communications, which I will now read. The hon. Member, as the House will observe, has objected to some public action which I took, and I found this letter on my return:—
 *MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH  (Inverness-shire) : I wish on the sub-head—Law Agent to the Woods and Forests in Scotland—to raise a question as to the alienation of Crown fisheries, and to ask for an assurance that the practice shall not be continued.
*(12.9.)  MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : I desire to call the attention of the Lord Advocate and the Secretary to the Treasury to the office of Register of Sasines. The matter has been before the Treasury for a number of years. There was great dissatisfaction on the part of many when that office was transferred to the Treasury. The higher officials were satisfied with their old position, but there are a considerable number of most deserving men called engrossing clerks who complain that they have been excluded from the benefits of the Act of 1879. These clerks have been constantly urging their being placed on the same footing as others—that is to say, the commissioned clerks—with powers of getting an increase of salary, and also of being promoted to higher grades. Of a sudden the Secretary for Scotland, no doubt acting on the advice of the Treasury, withdrew all countenance whatever from these
 502
*(12.26.)  MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : The right hon. Gentleman introduces the word "copyists," a
 504
 *MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : As a matter of form, I will move to reduce the Vote by £60.
 *MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : The right hon. Gentleman is mistaken in saying that the office is over-manned. By the greater use of printing, the work of the six Minute Book clerks has been lessened, otherwise the general business is larger than ever.
 MR. C. S. PARKER  (Perth) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate if he can state the amount of the residue now applicable in Scotland, under "The Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act, 1890, at the discretion of the authorities named in the Act, in relief of local rates, or in aid of technical education; and how soon the grant will be paid?
 MR. PARNELL : Well, Sir, I bow to your ruling; but however inconvenient it may be, when the time comes, I shall be compelled to stop the Appropriation Bill and re-open the question on the Committee stage. Keeping myself strictly within the limits of the ruling, I will say that from information I have received to-day, from a statement made by Alderman Manton, which I will venture to read to the House, there is every reason why the stringency of the rules under which Daly is treated should be relaxed pending the re-consideration of the case, which will undoubtedly become necessary. Here is Alderman Manton's letter—
 MR. PARNELL : Well, Sir, I am endeavouring to make my argument as close as possible to the subject of the treatment of the prisoners. Of course, Sir, if you say I cannot bring forward these arguments in favour of Daly's having a more lenient system of prison discipline extended to him, and later on introduce the question of an amnesty, I shall have to bring it before the Home Secretary, and also before the House of Commons itself, on the Appropriation Bill. If you hold that I am not in order in slightly referring to the circumstances of the conviction in order to strengthen my claim for proper treatment for the prisoner pending investigation of his case, I shall not persist.
 MR. PARNELL : Very well, Sir. What I propose to ask is this: that the Government extend the system of treatment to persons convicted of political offences now in penal servitude prisons that they extended to Mr. Davitt when he was re-arrested in 1881 and sent back to the same prison where John Daly and Egan are now confined. That, I apprehend, is a matter within the competency of the Commissioners—it is an alteration of the system which has no reference to the law. Indeed, Sir, I think the Statute is not concerned in this question of the treatment of penal servitude prisoners at all, because there never have been any Statutes passed for the purpose of regulating the treatment of penal servitude prisoners, who are treated in accordance with the rules framed from time to time by the authorities. The treatment of ordinary prisoners is regulated by rules framed under the provisions of Statutes, but the treatment of penal servitude prisoners is left very much to the discretion of the Home Secretary and to the Commissioners appointed by him. I think I ought to be allowed to point out that these men were tried as political offenders, but that the Statute under which they were undoubtedly arrested was not used against them. I might point out, further, that by being charged with treason-felony they could be transported for life, whereas had they been charged under the Explosive Substances Act they could only have been sent to penal servitude for 14 years. I observe that this is not contradicted by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, so that I suppose he accepts my statement. In addition, by not charging these men under the Explosives Act, they were precluded from the right which that Act conferred of giving testimony in their own defence. By being charged with treason-felony and conspiring to levy war upon the Queen, John Daly
 447
 MR. PARNELL : The sentence under Section 3 is limited to 20 years.
 MR. PARNELL : Very well, Sir; in that case I shall simply go on to say that in my judgment it is absolutely necessary that some discrimination should be shown with regard to the
 449
(5.32.)  MR. PARNELL  (Cork) : In dealing with this Vote I desire to refer to two questions which are intimately connected with each other. I desire to raise the question of the treatment of political prisoners suffering sentences of penal servitude in the convict establishments of this country. I shall, I think, be able to establish the claim, at all events of some of these men, to be treated as political prisoners suffering imprisonment in consequence of sentences for offences of a political character. And after I have dealt with that branch of the subject, I propose to go on to refer to the case of two prisoners now undergoing, one of them, a long sentence of penal servitude on the charge of treason felony, and the other, John Daly, undergoing a life sentence as a consequence of his conviction on the charge of treason felony. The time has now come when the whole question of the conviction and imprisonment, and continued imprisonment, of persons convicted years ago on charges of treason felony should be considered, with a view to determining whether, both on grounds of public policy and also by reference to the special circumstances of some of these cases, a measure of amnesty might not be extended to many of such prisoners. With regard to the first question, the treatment of political prisoners in convict establishments, it has never been brought before this House yet without results following. The old system of transportation for
 444 445
 MR. PARNELL : I was referring to Daly and Egan. They could only have been convicted under Section 4.
(5.10.)  MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I wish to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Indian Budget will be the first Order on some early day?
(5.21.)  MR. SCHWANN : Could not the Chancellor of the Exchequer cause these Bills from the Lords to be withdrawn entirely? I specially object to Order No. 39 on the Paper (Chartered Accountants Bill) being forced through in the small hours of the morning. That Bill, which is opposed by accountants throughout the country, was only introduced into the House of Lords about a week ago, and is a sample of a kind of legislation that ought not to be encouraged at this period of the Session.
 MR. SCHWANN : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that the Manchester Watch Committee, who have lately revised the pay of the police force in their employ, will not grant any pensions, under the new scale of pay, to men who retire before the expiration of 12 months from the introduction of the new scale of pay, even though certain of the men have been in the police force for more than 25 years, which is the time fixed for their retirement; is this refusal in accordance with the terms of the Police Superannuation Act of last year; and are police officers entitled to a pension in proportion to the rate of pay they are receiving at the date of their retirement, and to retire at the expiration of 25 years of service?
 MR. SCHWANN  (Manchester, N.) : I bag to ask the Secretary for War, whether he is aware that there is no permanent method of manufacturing ice at Trincomalee (Ceylon), where there is a garrison and hospital and only a temporary ice house erected, and furnished with ice from Colombo at the private expense of the Admiral for the time at the station, and whether he will consider the desirability of furnishing Trincomalee with permanent means of making ice, so necessary to hospital patients and the comfort of the garrison in a hot climate?
(10.52.)  MR. STUART WORTLEY : This subject has been investigated by a Departmental Committee. The proposal made to it was that the two classes, consisting of 43 first-class clerks and 139 second-class clerks, should be merged into one class, so that the majority should receive higher emoluments. This, however, was found impracticable on account of the different-sized prisons that had to be provided for; but the number of clerks of the first-class has been increased to 93, and the number in the second-class had been reduced to 83, and this involves the raising of a proportionate number of salaries from £140 to £190, and from £155 to £200. There has also been an increase in the number of storekeepers, whose position is one of advantage, and of the number of clerks who receive higher pay for taking charge of stores. In this way it is understood that grievances have substantially been met. Experience has shown that, whether owing to the centralisation of the prison system or other
 491
 MR. STUART WORTLEY : I am told that the Report is actually in proof at the present moment; but it has not yet come in.
 MR. STUART WORTLEY : No.
 MR. STUART WORTLEY : During the present Session.
(10.25.)  MR. STUART WORTLEY : The claims of the warders to increased pay and improved conditions of service are at present the subject of investigation by a Committee appointed this Session for the express purpose of dealing with their grievances, and until that Committee report it will be premature for me to enter into the matter. The last time the claims of the warders were investigated was in 1883, when a Committee decided that there was no cause for complaint, and did not recommend any increase of pay. As to the quarters of the officers at Portland Prison, the matter was the subject of a question in the House a few weeks ago, and it then appeared that, although some of the quarters are insanitary, those quarters have been vacated, and are now unoccupied. The matter is still receiving attention.
 MR. STUART WORTLEY : These prisons are only very small establishments, and there may be some where arrangements of the kind referred to have to be made. No doubt the hon. Member is right in suggesting that caution must be used in making these arrangements.
(10.5.)  MR. STUART WORTLEY : The prison chaplains in Wales are paid exactly as they are in England.
(9.25.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. STUART WORTLEY,  Sheffield, Hallam) : I must ask the Committee to remember that I am limited by the ruling from the Chair to the effect that the discussion of Prison Rules relating to discipline trenches on projects of legislation. The Government must adhere to the position that the Executive is not vested with dispensing powers which would enable it to differentiate the treatment of prisoners. Parliament has shown that it is jealous of conferring these powers. In 1865 a comprehensive Act was passed relating to prisons. The rules were expressly scheduled and were made incapable of variation at the discretion of the Executive. Again, in 1877, when the subject was reviewed, Parliament acted with equal caution, because, although a power was given to the Secretary of State to make rules as to differentiation of treatment, those powers were confined to the distinction between convicted and unconvicted prisoners and prisoners who are or who are not classed as debtors. In these circumstances, the alteration of the existing conditions of treatment cannot be discussed on the present Vote. On the general question I must adhere to the position taken by the Home Secretary, which is that experience shows that you cannot devise for a special class of offences which constitute a distinct breach of the law a different treatment from others which would not in effect give the offenders the glories of martyrdom without any of its pains.
 MR. PLUNKET : I have ascertained that there is a small piece of work, the cost of which is, I understand, less than
 410
 MR. MADDEN : No, Sir; I cannot do that.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : The Resolution mentioned was duly received and acknowledged. The Government would not feel justified in incurring the increased public expenditure which the proposal in regard to Mullingar Prison would involve.
 MR. MADDEN : I understand that it is the case that proceedings were instituted, as stated in the question, to compel compliance with agreements which the tenants had entered into. The case of M'Guiggan appears to have terminated in the manner indicated by the hon. and
 404
 MR. MADDEN said : Of course, I have no positive information to enable me to decide whether the appeal in the single case governed the decision in the other 249; but, whether or not, the hon. and learned Member knows perfectly well that it is a matter between the litigants themselves with which the Executive Government have no concern. Any representations on the subject from the 250 tenants should be addressed to the company.
 MR. MADDEN : The Government cannot accept the Amendment.
 MR. D. SULLIVAN  (Westmeath, S.) : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he can hold out any hope that the engineering branch of the telegraph service will be placed on the same footing as regards classification; and, if not, will he state the reason for withholding the concession?
 MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : I hope that time will be allowed to take the Bills of private Members which have reached the last stage.
*(11.38.)  MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : I think it right to confirm the observations which have fallen from the Lord Advocate. I have had considerable experience in the administration of the Criminal Law in Scotland. When I was at the Bar, and afterwards when I was Legal Secretary to the Lord Advocate, I was in constant correspondence with the Crown Agent.
 497
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : I wish to move to add to the Motion of the right hon. Gentleman,
 "And that no other business to which notice of Amendment has been placed on the Paper be proceeded with after 12 o'clock." 441
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : Will the right hon. Gentleman resist any Private Bills being taken after 12 o'clock?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : My question was whether the right hon. Gentleman will stop all opposed Private Business?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether there is any foundation for the statement in the  Phoni tis Kyprou "If the difference between the value of gold and paper money were taken into consideration, Cyprus would now be paying to the Porte £40,000 instead of £92,000 per annum;"
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I hope the right hon Gentleman will listen to the appeal of my hon. Friends. I do not want to bring unnecessary charges against the Government, but it is a curious coincidence that the Scotch Estimates are always brought on at a most inconvenient hour for Scotch Members. The crofter question is one of great importance to the Highlands of Scotland, and surely it ought to be debated at a reasonable hour.
 *MR. PICKERSGILL : The hon. Member says the prisons are small, but some of them contain 150 prisoners. But whether small or large the point is that these places are under the absolute control of men receiving only £3 per week. I ask how is it possible for such men to control the chaplain and surgeon—professional men of education? As to the Committee to which the hon. Member refers, it was appointed, I think, more than six months ago.
 *MR. PICKERSGILL : The hon. Member has not made any reference to the fact that some 12 prisons are at present under the control not of Governors, as under the old system, but of warders.
*(10.17.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I wish to draw attention to the conditions of service of prison warders. Their usual hours of labour are 12 per day—from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 in the evening—and every third night they have to remain on duty until 9 or 10, and sometimes until 12. In addition to this, the warder is frequently called on to sleep in the prison in case he is required, and yet he is expected to resume duty at the usual hour in the morning. Then, as to the wages of these men, they are exceedingly low having regard to the nature of the duties. On a man entering the Service he receives 23s. a week, with an increase of £1 a year for five years, when the increment stops, and the only chance he then has of further increase is by promotion. The chances of promotion, however, have during recent years been much lessened, owing, no doubt, to a happy cause—namely, the large diminution of the prison population. Still, that is no reason why some compensation, in some form or other, should not be given to those men for the loss they sustain in this respect. I find that some years ago an assistant warder, on an average, became a head warder at the end of seven years, whereas now the average period is about 15 years. Then, with regard to the quarters provided for the warders—for which they have to pay £9 2s. a year out of their already scanty pay—in some of the prisons they are in a very crowded and insanitary condition. A little while ago there appeared in the public journals a letter from Mr. Pearce Edgcumbe showing the way in which some of the warders are housed—showing that their residences at Portland are almost as bad as slums in the East End of London. Next, as to the question of superannuation. The age of compulsory retirement is 65, and a warder cannot retire on a full pension until he has served for 40 years. The  morale 486
 *MR. PICKERSGILL : Then, may I ask when it is likely to conclude its labours and present its Report?
 *MR. PICKERSGILL : How long ago?
 COLONEL SAUNDERSON  (Armagh, N.) : I beg to ask whether it is intended to proceed with the Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill after 12 o'clock?
(1.45.)  COLONEL SAUNDERSON : I am opposed to this Bill, and I believe that the vast majority of Irish Protestants are opposed to it. We believe, rightly or wrongly, that this is a Bill in the direction of denominational education in Ireland, to which we are bitterly opposed. We also believe that the Bill will endow the training colleges of the Church of Rome with a very considerable sum of money out of the Irish Church Surplus Fund, and to that also we are bitterly opposed. I resist the Bill on the ground that it is an extremely contentious measure and one which ought to be carefully considered and debated before it is passed. It is impossible to do that at this late hour of the night, and I hope the Government will not press the Bill.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : The contract with Messrs. Harvey with regard to the supply of coal to Maker Fort, Tregantle Fort, and Picklecombe Fort, is for North Country coal; and, on inquiry, it is reported to me that such coal has been duly supplied.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : Messrs. Bramble, the contractors for barracks, forts, &c, at Portsmouth, undertook to pay the wages generally paid in the district, and I have not received any notice from persons concerned that Messrs. Bramble have not fulfilled their pledge.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle) : The question of securing a supply of ice for Trincomalee is now under consideration.
 *MR. CHANNING : I cannot accept the interpretation the hon. Gentleman has given of the Acts and the powers given by them. But in any case, however the Acts may be interpreted, I submit that the Home Secretary clearly has the power of issuing a Circular addressed to Magistrates calling their attention to the powers they possess with regard to the treatment of prisoners, and I would still press upon the right hon. Gentleman to consider the expediency of doing so.
*(8.8.)  MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I desire to move the reduction of this Vote by the sum of £100, in order that I may draw attention to the great anomalies which exist in the treatment of prisoners in English prisons, and with a view of impressing upon the Home Secretary the desirability of taking steps to exercise the powers he now possesses under the Prisons Act to bring about a better state of things. The questions to which I wish to draw attention may be briefly stated. The questions put by me to the right hon. Gentleman and questions asked in "another place" have elicited the fact that persons committed to prison for the non-payment of fines under the Vaccination Acts or under certain local Acts, such as that at Eastbourne, under which Salvationists are being punished, are subjected to the whole of the disagreeable and odious incidents of ordinary imprisonment; whereas persons committed to prison in respect of exactly the same Acts, who are committed to prison for the nonpayment of costs, as opposed to fines, have, under the Prison Rules at present existing, the advantage, such as it is, of being treated under the debtors' rule". I contend that it is within the power of the Home Secretary, under the Prisons
 471 472 473 "Consider a case I heard of only a few hours ago. A respectable woman, wife of an English tradesman, refused to have her child vaccinated, and went to prison. She was forcibly stripped, and put into the bath, was, in fact, treated as if she had been the dirtiest tramp from the streets.… So far as I understand the philosophy of punishment at all, these kinds of punishment, which are thought to inflict degradation, need not, and ought not, to form part of the penal system, because the evil of that kind of punishment is this—that the hardened criminal is not punished by it at all." "Those who have been condemned under the Vaccination Act, and in connection with the Salvation Army, are the class of prisoners who chiefly command our sympathies, and who ought to receive the benefit of any modification which may be made in the law."
 *MR. CHANNING : On the point of order, Sir, may I draw your
 480
(1.15.)  MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, S.E.) : I should like to call the attention of the Home Secretary to the desirability of having a County Court at Grays. There is a population there of 20,000. The place is close to Tilbury Docks, and not long since a deputation of merchants and traders and farmers petitioned the Lord Chancellor for a Court. That Memorial has not even been acknowledged. I hope a County Court will be established at Grays, and I can assure the Government it will entail no expense in the matter of providing buildings, as there are some there suitable for the purpose.
 LORD HENRY BRUCE  (Wilts, Chippenham) : I think that the House is acting very harshly towards the hon. Member, who, whatever his mistakes, has tried to do his duty as a private Member.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : With reference to the remarks which have been made, I feel very strongly some of the observations which have dropped from hon. Members opposite—that the hon. Member for Boston lacks, to a certain extent, the power of self-control, and that much of that which seems to be most offensive may be the result of sudden impulse on his part. I venture very respectfully to submit that the Motion I have made is not only a punishment—and I do not wish it should be regarded simply as a punishment of the hon. Member—but that it is a continued protection to the Speaker during the time the hon. Member may remain in the same state of mind as he is now. His particular friend (the hon. Member for Spalding)

 *MR. GOSCHEN : I think the hon. Member must appoint his own sentinel. There may be a few Bills which are unanimously desired in every part of the House, and any promise of mine might frustrate the passing of such Bills. No new legislation of a controversial nature will be introduced.
*(5.7.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I can assure the hon. and learned Member that his Amendment is not necessary, for I will
 438
 *MR. GOSCHEN : No Lords' Bills. Of course the hon. Member is alluding to Bills which come from the Lords, and not the Lords' Amendments. As to the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Derby, I do not quite understand whether it applies wholly to Government business or not.
*(4.51.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I rise to move—
 "That, for the remainder of the Session, Government Business be not interrupted under the provisions of any Standing Order regulating the Sittings of the House, and may be entered upon at any hour though opposed." 435
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I have nothing to add to what the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant has already said on that subject.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I will answer the questions which have been put to me when I make the Motion on the Paper.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I doubt whether a more painful case than this has been before the House, I may say, during the whole of our Parliamentary history. If there is one office the dignity of which is valued by this House and by the country generally, it is that of the Speaker. I am only expressing the feelings which obtain universally in every part of the House when I say that you, Sir, have shown courtesy and impartiality to all sides of the House and to every Member of the House. You, Sir, have been obliged to appeal to the House against a Member of this House [Mr. ATKINSON: Oh, oh!] and you have said it is intolerable that during the whole of last week you have had to complain of the conduct of the hon. Member. I venture to think it will be the universal feeling of the House
 426 "That the hon. Member for Boston be suspended for the rest of the Session, and be excluded from the precincts of the House."
 MR. GOSCHEN : I have to inform the hon. Member that the London University failed to obtain the sanction of Convocation to the draft scheme, by which they proposed to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. Thereupon the Privy Council resumed their consideration of the Petition of University and King's Colleges for the grant of a charter, and after considerable discussion, requested the petitioners to submit an amended draft charter. This has just been done; but before the Committee report to Her Majesty, the draft charter as finally settled must be laid before both Houses for 30 days. It will then, of course, be subject to discussion in Parliament, and it will be for Parliament, and not for the Government, to decide whether it shall be accepted.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Member will see, on referring to the Treasury Minute of March 24, that the vacancies in the third class of surveyors were caused by the creation of three additional first-class and four additional second-class surveyorships,
 "Which shall remain until such time as the whole of the existing third-class surveyors who may be fit for promotion shall have been promoted."
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I assume that the "recent legislation" to which the hon. Member alludes is the Crofters' Common Grazings Bill, which is now awaiting the Royal assent, but it is no anticipated that the new duties imposed upon the Commissioners by this measure will make any very serious call on their time. I much regret that the Commissioners have not been able to overtake their work at a more rapid rate, but the hon. Member will understand that it would be practically impossible, even if it were thought altogether advisable, to introduce the legislation necessary to increase their number at so late a stage of the Session.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : Surely the hon. and gallant Gentleman will see there are several Bills on the Paper which are non-contentious, and which might very properly be taken even at this hour. I trust hon. Gentlemen will allow us to make progress with those Bills, which are not controversial.
 MR. GOSCHEN : As you, Sir, have to be in the Chair at 3 o'clock, and seeing that it is impossible to make further progress with business to-night, I will not offer any opposition to the Motion.
(1.9.)  MR. GOSCHEN : It is not the fault of the Government that the Scotch Votes have come on at a late hour. Hoping the House may make some progress with other matters, and in order to prevent wrangling and frequent visits to the Division Lobby, I reluctantly give way to the view of the Scotch Members. I hope, however, that discussion will not be prolonged to an undue length to-morrow.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I am afraid that that not being a Government Bill, cannot he taken after 1 o'clock.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I would venture to urge hon. Gentlemen not to press the Motion. I rather gather that it is the general feeling of the House that we should sit late to-night to endeavour to make progress.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Member must bear in mind that this year the Estimates are being taken in their regular order, and that, therefore, his complaint that Scotch Estimates are postponed to the last does not apply. I must protest against his suggestion that we put Scotland in a back place in these matters.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. There were special circumstances brought forward in the case of the English prison officials. I do not know whether those special circumstances apply to Scotland.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I am sure there is no wish on the part of any occupant of the Government Bench to be discourteous to hon. Gentlemen. We are asked why we have dealt with the case of the English officials only. It is a little discouraging that the moment we attempt to deal with the alleged grievances of one class of officials, a host of other grievances is to be raised. Certain grievances were put forward by English prison officials. According to hon. Gentlemen opposite, we have not satisfied them; we have endeavoured to satisfy them, but we have not, and I regret that that has been the result. Special circumstances were put before us in the case of the English officials. We have not had any special case put forward by the Scotch officials, and the reason why we have not attempted to deal with the case of the Scotch officials is that it has not been brought forward. If they can prove that the same grounds exist for favourably considering their case, as were shown in the case of the English officials, the attention of the Treasury will, no doubt, be given to the matter. I hope hon. Members will see after this intimation that we have not been niggardly in the case of Scotland. I do not wish to shut the door to any claim that may be made. I only repeat that we have only dealt with the special circumstances put before us.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I thought that was the view of the right hon. Gentleman. What I undertake is this, that if the House is fairly unanimous in proceeding with these Bills, we will not deprive private Members of their chance. We adopt this attitude not in the interest of the Government, but in the interest of private Members. With regard to the question of the right hon. Member for Derby relating to the Lords' Amendments to the Education Bill, I had hoped that it would not be necessary to interrupt Supply. If we should be so fortunate as to finish Supply by Wednesday evening, we should be in a position to take the Education Bill on Thursday. However, seeing the interest hon. Members take in the Amendments, and in order to facilitate business, I will undertake that the Lords' Amendments to the Bill shall be taken, under any circumstances, on Thursday next as the first Order.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : Yes, Sir; I think the Indian Budget will come soon after the Lords' Amendments to the Education Bill have been disposed of. If we should be fortunate enough to finish Supply on Wednesday night we would take the Education Bill on Thursday, and possibly we might take the Indian Budget after that or on Friday. I do
 439
*(5.15.)  MR. GOSCHEN : With regard to Wednesday I think we may sit till 6 or half-past 6 o'clock. I am not favourable to the House sitting later than half-past six on Wednesday evenings if it can be avoided. As to the remarks of the hon. Member for Leicester concerning the Clergy Discipline Bill, I cannot believe there will be much opposition to the first four clauses, and it is very desirable that they should be passed. With regard to the Scotch Votes, I will endeavour to meet the views of hon. Gentlemen from Scotland as far as I can, but I cannot give a definite pledge as to the time when they will be taken.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : Yes.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I will endeavour to arrive at a compromise in the matter. It is because I wish to protect private Members that I hesitated to meet the views of the hon. Member for Dundee. But I will undertake, if it meets the general view, that no Private Bills at all shall be proceeded with after 1 o'clock.
 MR. GOSCHEN : After Supply is finished there may be an opportunity between 12 and 1 o'clock for these Bills to come on. Till Supply is finished, I must adhere to the view I have expressed.
 MR. HALLEY STEWART  (Lincolnshire, Spalding) : As I am closely connected with the constituency of the hon. Member, and as a large number of his constituents, through the dual operation of the franchise, vote in the Parliamentary Division which I represent, I venture to say a few words, although that reason in itself is not sufficient warrant for my intervention in this painful matter. I have been brought into close personal relationship with the hon. Member. We live in the same town, and I can assure the Speaker and the House that the conduct of which complaint is made is exactly that suffered by everyone who has been brought into association with the hon. Member for Boston. If the matter were not so serious it would be ludicrous, but I hope the House will see it is simply the habitual conduct of an impulsive man, which considerably detracts from the personal offence towards the Speaker in
 429
 MR. ATKINSON : I wish simply to say it is a very convenient way of settling the Motion which stands in my name, but the moment I come back I will move it. I am not going to be silenced by anything of the sort.
 MR. ATKINSON : Is that in order? Oh, then, I will withdraw, but I will come back and prove my case to be what I have said it is.
 Mr. ATKINSON  then withdrew.
 MR. ATKINSON : I protest against that from a Liberal. He is not my leader.
 MR. ATKINSON : I feel bound to claim freedom of speech again, as a duly elected Member of this House. I protest against any attempt to prevent my discharging my duty to my constituents. I say that I have been obstructed by the officials of this House for a week past and more, and if the House will give me a Committee I will prove that I have been so obstructed. I have given notice during that time of Motions which impugned the conduct of the Clerks at the Table, and I have to ask why they were not printed. I have the courage of my opinions, and when anybody tries to prevent me doing my duty he will not find, wherever he sits, on this side of the House or the other, that I will submit to it. I therefore ask the House, even now, to appoint a Committee on the subject, or to listen while I give the other side of the matter which the Speaker has put before the House. Just now, when the right hon. Gentleman was giving an account of the last Division, he did not mention the fact that Dr. Tanner [ Cries of 425
 MR. ATKINSON : Order order! It is not true.
 MR. ATKINSON : Not true.

 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not give away the privileges of private Members.
(3.50.)  MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I very respectfully claim freedom of speech in order to call your attention to the Journals put before the House to-day, which contain a statement with reference to me which, if it were true, would make me ashamed of myself and my conduct as a Member of Parliament for the remainder of my days. It is stated that I, on Friday night, frivolously called for Divisions. I beg to say that the matter I took in hand—namely, the timber trade advocacy—was not known to me until two days previously. There had been a large meeting of the timber trade, and I was moved by a well known firm to take the matter up. I represented to them that they should not pass by the three Members for Hull and their county Members and ask me to do it simply because I was a Hull man, but I was told by my friends that, as I had been 45 years in the business, I was the best fitted to take the matter up. Being pressed to undertake the duty, at length I consented, although there were other matters which I wished to attend to. I went through my duties the other night with extreme reluctance and great regret, and although I had given notice of nine Amendments to postpone for three months the Bills in question, when I found that the feeling of the House was against me, I let five of the Bills go without challenge. I then believed that an hon. Member had spoken in the sense in which I was speaking, and so I named him as a Teller with mo, but the hon. Member immediately got up and said that he did not go as far as I did, and thereupon the House laughed, and I let the Amendment go. Another hon. Member on the other side of the House, with whom I had never before acted and of whom I ought to have been

 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department
 407
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I have nothing but the kindest feeling towards the hon. Member for Boston, but we must not look at the matter as a personal question. We must look at what has occurred in the House. I go no further back than this evening. The hon. Member said the Chair had persecuted him for a week past on account of the Resolution he had put down in regard to the Chair. It is perfectly impossible that any representative Assembly respecting its Chairman can sit quiet and allow such words to pass without punishment of the peccant Member, and, if ever there was a case in which suspension should follow, this is the one. Members are suspended by the Rules of this House, and when an hon. Gentleman addresses the Speaker in such words as has been used this evening, he ought to be suspended. I will, however, suggest that it would meet the views of many hon. Members on this side of the House if some specific period of suspension were named in the Resolution. It is rather vague to say it shall last till the end of the Session. Of course, we hope the end is near, but we do not know.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not agree to the suggestion of my hon. Friend. If there is to be a massacre of innocents, let all suffer alike.
 MR. LABOUCHERE : The taxpayer is not likely to gain very much from the proposals of Scotch Members. I find that whenever Scotch Members suggest the reduction of one salary they invariably suggest an increase in two or three others. Therefore, I am content with things as they are. I wish to complain of the item of £50 for the trial of Election Petitions. That item has appeared in the Estimates for the last 10 years, and I think that when the Minister in charge of a particular Estimate states that he does not anticipate for a moment that it will be spent during the current year it ought not to appear on the Estimates. The result is, it is transferred to some other item under the head of law charges, or it goes to swell the Budget surplus at the end of the year.
 MR. MATTHEWS : My hon. Friend the Under Secretary is not in his place. If the Vote is postponed he will give the information to-morrow.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Daly and Egan were also guilty under Section 3, and the jury might have found Daly guilty under that section in consequence of his having done acts or having conspired to cause an explosion by means of an explosive substance. The offence under Section 4 was the minor offence of being in possession, contrary to the law, of an explosive substance, and thereby giving rise to reasonable suspicion that he intended to cause an explosion.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The evidence satisfied the jury. I am anxious not to appear to prejudice the case, but it is impossible to read the evidence—
 MR. MATTHEWS : Taking it for granted that there has been a proper conviction, and looking at the character of it, it is impossible to say that the treatment in a convict prison is too severe. The present punishment is itself a relaxation of the old law of treason-felony, under which the prisoners would have forfeited their lives. Modern ideas of greater clemency have brought about the less extreme punishment. Having regard to the Chairman's ruling, there is no other topic which I am entitled to discuss in this case. I would remind the Committee that I have instigated what I endeavoured to make a perfectly independent and impartial inquiry into the treatment of the Irish prisoners in Chatham Prison, and then the prisoners had every opportunity of stating their grievances. As it is evident that the discussion is to be renewed, I will say no more on the present occasion.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Twice.
(7.25.)  MR. MATTHEWS : I cannot help regretting that the hon. and learned Member has indulged in so many disagreeable suspicions. He says that the Coroner's Jury consisted mainly of contractors to the prison. No intimation of that kind has been made to me, and I think the hon. and learned Gentleman is entirely mistaken. As to McGrath, I may say that a very short time before his death he was in excellent health. In February, 1890, the Report of the Medical Inspector was—
 "Health good on reception, and has continued so up to the present time. Only once admitted into hospital for bronchial attack. Free from organic disease, No complaint was made." 463
 MR. MATTHEWS : Probably he was too ill to be removed at all. He was at Chatham, and his mother and sister were at Salford. The Coroner's Jury found that he died from natural causes. I have been asked as to the conversations with Egan. It is an invariable prison rule that complaints as to treatment must be made to the officials, whose duty it is to inquire into them, and, if necessary, to redress the grievances. It would be quite impossible that a prisoner should avail himself of the visits of friends to bring charges against those in authority. Then, I have been asked about the removal of those prisoners to Chatham. As I stated on the 4th of December, 1890, there was absolutely no reason in the interest of the prisoners for removing them from Chatham. The occupants of the cells at Chatham are amongst the best of prisoners, certainly so far as health is concerned. The premises have since been transferred to the Admiralty, and in consequence I am gradually transferring the prisoners there to other prisons. Eight of the prisoners, including Egan and Daly, have been transferred to Portland. There are still some prisoners at Chatham, and they will be removed before long.
 MR. MATTHEWS : My experience is that prisoners always do. Certainly there is nothing inconsistent with the prison rules in their doing so. Of course, no interview has hitherto been allowed in convict prisons except in the sight and hearing of a warder. ["The  Times 464
 MR. MATTHEWS : It did not reach the Home Office until a late hour.
 MR. MATTHEWS : At 6.30 the Public Offices are closed. Then, at the Home Office they had no knowledge of the date at which the hon. Member wished to visit this prisoner.
 MR. MATTHEWS : That shows that the hon. Member's case is even stronger than he has hitherto made out and I repeat my apologies to him. I express my regret that the hon. Member should have suffered any inconvenience. Such a visit to the convict as he asked for was a novelty, and it was only introduced in consequence of the hon. Member's application.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I cannot tell the hon. Member how it was.
(6.30.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I have pleasure in saying that I have very little to add under the limitations imposed by the ruling of the Chair. The facts to which the hon. Member has alluded are not new to me. They were brought before my notice some time ago, and since then I have on two or three occasions gone with all possible minuteness and impartiality into an investigation of every circumstance connected with the conviction of Daly. I have satisfied myself that the suggestions of the hon. Member are entirely groundless, and are little more than the creation of imagination. I have scrutinised most carefully everything that has been done under the direction of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, and I have been able to detect nothing that could call for the slightest censure or blame. I hope that this direct denial will be a sufficient answer to the allegations that have been made by the hon. Member. I will point out that if I had discovered the slightest ground for supposing that there was anything in the nature of a plot against Daly, such a discovery would not have led me to a relaxation of treatment, but to instant release of the prisoner. The hon. Member for Cork contends that the prisoners in question ought to have been convicted under the Explosives Act instead of being convicted for treason-felony, and that they would have then enjoyed the double advantage of giving evidence themselves and of suffering a shorter sentence.
(8.31.)  MR. MATTHEWS : The hon. Member has treated an interesting subject in an interesting way, but, unfortunately for his argument, the
 474 475
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, there the numbers exceed the numbers in English prisons where the remuneration is from £200 to £300, but usually the proportion is the same in both countries for that scale of payment. I might, therefore, rest my defence on that. But upon this Motion for reduction I can only say we do not find that the salaries paid for duties rendered in England are too large. For an increase in the remuneration to Scotch chaplains the hon. Member must address his arguments to the Treasury.
(9.47.)  MR. MATTHEWS : I admire the extraordinary ingenuity of the hon. Gentleman who, under colour of finding fault with the salaries paid to English chaplains, has practically insinuated that the salaries of chaplains in Scotland ought to be raised. But this is a matter over which I have no control; the hon. Member should address his arguments to the representatives of the Treasury. The hon. Gentleman omitted to explain that the salaries of the chaplains in both countries are based upon the population of the prisons, and until very recently there was no Scotch prison whose population entitled the chaplain to the higher rate of remuneration. The salaries paid in England to first-class chaplains are in respect to prisons where there is a large daily average of prisoners.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I say that I have nothing to do with the Scotch prisons.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have really nothing to do with the Scotch prisons.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I can only repeat what my hon. Friend has already told the Committee. I do not assert that the condition of these clerks is all that could be desired, but it is not possible to alter the conditions of the Public Service for the sake of one small class. The clerks in the Prison Department are in a position that compares not

 MR. MATTHEWS : There is no provision by law for the appointment of any chaplains except those belonging to the Established Church.
 MR. MATTHEWS : They are not chaplains, but Roman Catholic priests, who are appointed to officiate amongst a certain number of prisoners.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The exhumation order was granted on June 15 at the instance of the Director of the Public Prosecutions. The result of the  postmortem
 MR. MATTHEWS : The Report quoted was originally written by the Visiting Commissioners in the Visitors' Book at the North Riding Asylum, in order that it might come to the notice of the Visiting Committee, whose province it is, under Section 276 of the Act of last year, to deal with the subject of religious provision for the patients. I am informed by the Superintendent of the asylum that the Report was considered by the Committee of Visitors, who decided that the practice hitherto pursued of allowing Roman Catholic patients, when well enough, to attend, if they desire it, the services of the Roman Catholic Church at York be continued; and that care be taken to communicate with a priest in the event of any patient being seriously ill, or wishing to be visited by a priest. I am also informed that the priests have willingly visited the members of their Church, and have always attended when summoned.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am informed by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners that certain fixed payments made to incumbents out of rates levied under the authority of Local Acts are included in Part 3 of the Return (column 9); but it does not include any receipts from fees, pew rents, Easter and other offerings, or income derived from voluntary sources, other than interest, &c, derived from benefactions permanently invested. The tithe rent-charges included under column 2 of Part 3 are entered at the "commuted amount" or "par value."
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I am informed by the Chairman of the Manchester Watch Committee that no Resolution has been adopted whereby
 401
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : In reply to the hon. Member, I have to say that I received a Petition on the subject to which he refers, and at once caused inquiry to be made. The result of that inquiry has just been reported to me, and I regret to say that at none of the villages mentioned would a telegraph office be self-supporting. I shall be glad to forward the Petition to the Scottish office, but I think it will be found that the whole of the grant placed at the disposal of that department for extension of the telegraph in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland for the current year has been expended.
 *MR. RAIKES : The post to and from Ness, in the Island of Lewis, already entails an expenditure which largely exceeds the revenue from the correspondence. The post to other districts, besides that of Ness, is restricted to two days a week, and having regard to the heavy charge which the mail service with the island as a whole entails on the Revenue, I regret that I should not be justified in sanctioning any increase in the frequency of the internal posts.
 *MR. RAIKES : In reply to my hon. Friend, I am compelled to say that I could not accept an offer from the sub-postmaster to work without remuneration; but I shall be glad to establish a
 405
 *MR. RAIKES : I regret that I am not yet in a position to afford the hon. Member definite information on the question of an extension of the telegraph to Heylor. The wire which passes within about two-miles of that place is already sufficiently weighted with telegraph offices, and it will, I fear, be a most expensive operation to provide a satisfactory means of communication. As soon as the inquiries have been completed, I will communicate with the hon. Member.
 MR. H. BYRON REED  (Bradford, E.) : I desire to add a few words in the spirit of the observations which have been just addressed to the House. I do not think the hon. Member was actuated by a desire to outrage the House or the Chair, but his conduct is rather an expression of waywardness in circumstances with which many hon. Gentlemen sympathise, and such a punishment as a suspension for a fortnight would afford a grave precedent. I hope, therefore, that the House will, under the circumstances, accept the suggestion of the Member for West Belfast.
*(7.54.)  MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary that according to his statement anybody who happens to be left in the Home Office, after he and the other persons in authority have gone away, are at liberty to send messages to such people as the hon. Member for North Wexford saying that they cannot avail themselves of privileges that they had supposed were given to them. The right hon. Gentleman did not offer an explanation of the circumstances under which the telegram was sent down saying that the hon. Member would not have the privilege for which he asked. It seems to be an extraordinary thing that a doorkeeper or a junior clerk should have the power to send these telegrams.
 *MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : When this Vote was under Debate the Government promised to state what steps had been taken to secure the attendance of female warders at police stations where women are detained at night time.
 MR. WATT  (Glasgow, Camlachie) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admirality whether, with reference to his recent statement with regard to the Naval Volunteers that he would be ready to consider any propositions which would give greater effect to the wish of the Admiralty to convert the Corps into a Marine Corps, he will allow enlistments to go on for the present, so as to maintain the strength of the present force, pending negotiations for its conversion into a Coastguard Naval Corps, or such other form as will meet the requirements of the Service and the views of the Volunteers?
 MR. BRYCE  (Aberdeen, S.) : I beg to ask when the Scotch Supplementary Education Vote will be taken?
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I hope we shall have some explanation respecting the increase in the salaries of the English officials. Before the increase took place in November last the Scotch and English clerks were on exactly the same level, and surely we are entitled to know why, when the work of the clerks in both countries is precisely the same, an increase should be given to the clerks in one country and not to those in the other?
(12.5.)  MR. CALDWELL : I think we could secure the services of a very superior Law Agent in Scotland for £1,000 a year. It would be for the public interest if the Crown Agent and the Agent for Woods and Forests were made into one official, who should not have private practice and be the agent of a large landowner, and who should be permanently in office; because in connection with criminal procedure in

 "Provided that the amount to be expended for sub-sections 3, 4, and 5 shall not, without the consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, exceed two-fifths of the sum to be paid for the said site."
 MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N.) : But there are many Acts included in this Bill which we object to.
(7.41.)  MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N.) : The Committee are now face to face with a very important question in connection with prison discipline. I do not, in consequence of your ruling, Mr. Courtney, propose to go into the case of Daly, but I would lay stress on the point dealt with by the hon. Member who has just sat down, and that is as to the right of prison warders to interfere in conversations between prisoners and their visitors. An important admission has been made. We now know from the Home Secretary that such an important matter as the conviction of a prisoner can be referred to on the occasion of these visits, and we now find from the evidence in the Blue Book that Daly himself, when he thought he was on the point of death, begged to be allowed to make a statement as to the innocence of this unfortunate man Egan. Surely, then, it becomes a matter of very extreme gravity indeed if an ordinary warder can interfere with a man like Egan, when he wishes to put his visitor in possession of certain proofs or circumstances that may help to establish his innocence. We are told by the hon. Member for North Wexford that the warder on his own authority interfered in the hon. Member's conversation with Egan, and stated that the latter could not say anything about his conviction. The warder evidently took that course on his own responsibility, and of course my hon. Friend would have no appeal. The time permitted for the interview—15 or 20 minutes—would not allow of an appeal to the Governor, and very probably, if such an appeal had been allowed, it would have been barren of result. I

 MR. MACLEAN  (Oldham) : I think it only right that some Member on this side of the House should make response to the generous sentiment to which expression has been given by hon. Members opposite. Everybody who knows the hon. Member for Boston must respect him for his honesty and independence of character; and no one can help having a vary kindly feeling towards him. We know the hon. Member has not great powers of self-command, but it is certain that in his conduct towards the Speaker he never has had the slightest intention of showing any personal rudeness or discourtesy. I am quite sure the hon. Member did not intend to use the words "false charge" in his letter to suggest that a deliberate mis-statement had been made against him by the Clerks on the Minutes. His only object was to say that the statement that he had "frivolously" pressed a Division was erroneous. With the greatest possible respect for the Chair, I think it is open to question whether the hon. Member acted frivolously in calling for a Division. Speaking with some years' acquaintance of the hon. Member, in which I have known his many good qualities, I am aware that the hon. Member is frequently given to making remarks which he certainly does not intend to be taken as discourteous. I therefore hope the Leader of the House will be satisfied with passing a censure upon the hon. Member's conduct, and will not proceed to the extremity of suspending him.
 MR. O'KELLY  (Roscommon, N.) : If unanimity is desired the shorter the right hon. Gentleman makes the period of suspension the better. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that he
 434
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : There is another view in which the Motion should be considered, namely, that of sympathy with the hon. Member for Boston. Although differences of opinion have been expressed as to the details of the course to be pursued, there is no one who is not thoroughly earnest and loyal in supporting the Chair. The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not impute malice to the hon. Member for Boston. He imputes nothing but a temporary lack of self-control, and, when we consider the great gravity of suspending a Representative of the people for any considerable time, I think the Resolution might be amended. Had the hon. Member been allowed 24 hours for consideration the result might have been that he would have come and amply
 432
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : May I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he succeeds this evenng in getting the suspension of the 12 o'clock Rule, he will proceed with the Clergy Discipline (Immorality) Bill, seeing that the Bill is very much disputed, not only in this House but outside; and whether it does not come under the pledge recently given by the Government that contentious measures would not be proceeded with?
 MR. PICTON : Can the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inform the House whether Miss Kate Greenfield has been released?
 MR. PICTON  (Leicester) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the revenues in the Return of the Revenues of the Church of England (No. 287) are limited to the annual income arising from permanent endowments, and do not include rates levied under local or other Acts, in London and elsewhere, for the maintenance of the clergy, fees, pew rents, Easter, or
 416
 MR. PICTON : The Chancellor of the Exchequer has certainly lightened the load with regard to the Clergy Discipline Bill. Probably to the first four clauses most people will agree, but it is more than likely that they will be discussed and opposed, and I would suggest to the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it is worth while to run the risk of this after 12 o'clock in order simply to, pass the four clauses referred to.
 MR. PICTON : I hope the Government will accept the Amendment. If it be rejected it means that we must take the trouble of stopping here till 3 or 4 or perhaps 5 in the morning in order to say—"I object."
(9.30.)  MR. PICTON : The Under Secretary has said that certain regulations were framed and scheduled, but we have known cases in which—
 MR. PICTON : If I am precluded from discussing the punishment on prisoners convicted of offences against the Vaccination Laws, I confess I am rather at a loss. I can only say that, having the honour to be a Member of the Vaccination Commission, I feel myself under a difficulty, for I have no right here to express an opinion on the general subject, but I may say that evidence already published shows that the exercise of discipline in prisons with regard to prisoners who have been actuated by conscientious motives is irritating to public feeling, and ought to be amended as soon as possible.
 MR. PICTON : It is with regard to the treatment of different classes of prisoners that hardships exist, and upon which there is much feeling in the country.
 MR. PICTON : Cannot the exercise of the discretion of the Home Secretary be discussed under this Vote?
(2.18.)  MR. RENTOUL  (Down, E.) : Mr. Courtney, I beg to move that you do now leave the Chair.
 THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : The duties of the office are of an important character, and it is a permanent office. The gentleman in question acts as solicitor for the Crown in Scotland, and in that capacity has the management of criminal prosecutions. The present holder of the office is Mr. Jamieson, who is well known as one of the most accomplished and experienced men of business in the country. He is engaged, as all his predecessors were, in the conduct of business on his own account; but I am convinced that no public service rendered to Scotland is more valuable than that performed by the Crown Agent.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I may point out that the Crown Agent has no power to determine who is to be prosecuted, or what shall take place in that direction. For that the Lord Advocate is responsible. No professional man of such standing would consent to give his entire services for £1,200 a year, and it is quite unnecessary that any such change should be made.
(11.50.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I am not sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman quite realises the functions
 499
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : There have recently been no election petition appeals, and the item for the officer under that head is not a Vote so much as an Estimate. The sum may not be necessary.
(11.56.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : As regards the fees in addition to the salary which the Lord Advocate's Secretary receives, these are mainly for drafting, and they vary from year to year. I cannot say off-hand how much the Secretary receives, this year or last year, because recently the method which I think best has been adopted of having the bills drafted by experts. As regards Advocates Depute, the fees they receive, in addition to their salaries, are fees given in cases where they are merely selected as counsel in appeals to the High Court of Justiciary or suspensions in special cases relating to the decisions given in Courts below. In such cases, the Procurator Fiscal in Edinburgh or

 *THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : The amount available for distribution is £48,051 15s. 2d., and it is expected that the grant will be paid in the course of this week.
 MR. TUITE  (Westmeath, N.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he has received a copy of a Resolution adopted by the Grand Jury of Westmeath, re-questing that the prison at Mullingar be re-established as a major prison; and, if so, can he now state the decision of the Government on the matter?
(7.34.)  MR. J. BARRY  (Wexford, S.) : I regret, Mr. Courtney, that under your ruling it is not possible to discuss the case of Daly on this Vote, and I regret it the more because I believe
 465 466
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : There are 19 Orders of the Day apart from the Government Orders, and as to 16 of them it is absolutely impossible that they can pass this Session. On the other hand, there are three which have reached the Report stage, and I do think the Government might make some exception in their favour.
(2.0.)  MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N) : I do not wish to deal with denominational or mixed education, or to enter into the circumstances in relation to denominationalism in Ireland. My position arises out of the introduction of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund. If that were struck out I should know there is no intention of endowing Roman Catholic institutions out of the money of the disendowed Protestant Church. I feel bound to support the Motion to report Progress for more reasons than

 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : We have just decided by a Division that it is too late to go on with business; and, therefore, I do not think it is respectful to hon. Members to ask them to sit longer. I think that under the circumstances I would be quite justified in moving that the House do now adjourn.
 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I am quite willing to bear witness that the Speaker has always treated every Member with the greatest possible courtesy, even at times when relations have been somewhat strained. The conduct of the hon. Member for Boston justifies its being reported to the House, but I must strongly object to the form of the Motion, which is an enormous innovation and of grave political significance. It is quite unusual in my experience to suspend an hon. Member for a first offence for the remainder of the Session, and that course

 MR. J. REDMOND : But they were good enough to intimate to me that I could go on any day I chose to select.
(7.31.)  MR. J. REDMOND : If the right hon. Gentleman will look at the hour at which it was handed in, he will find that it was early in the afternoon. Speaking from memory I should say it was 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The hour at which the reply was sent out will show that the right hon. Gentleman is again in the wrong, and in saying that, of course I do not question his  bona fides
 MR. J. REDMOND : My telegram was sent early in the afternoon.
(6.18.)  MR. J. REDMOND  (Wexford, N.) : It may be convenient if the Home Secretary will allow me to intervene for a moment. I regret extremely, Mr. Courtney, that your ruling prevents us going into the substance of the case. That ruling has already placed us in some little difficulty, because it is very hard to listen to the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby without attempting to reply to it. I confess I do think nothing could be more unfortunate to Daly, from his point of view, than that we should have a fragmentary discussion on one point or another point in his case. When the opportunity comes it will be shown, on the solemn declaration of the Chief Constable of Birmingham, and on the statements of a number of other persons in similar positions, that there was a plot on the part of the agents of the Irish Police. I regret extremely that it is not possible to go fully into the case. The case must be gone into fully, and I hope the occasion will soon come. In anticipation of that occasion and obeying your ruling, Sir, I shall refrain from any further reply to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby. This, however, I desire to say before I sit down: I regret very much that I was not in my place in the House on the last occasion when the case was mentioned, because the Home Secretary apparently made statements it would be difficult to substantiate. The right hon. Gentleman pleaded misapprehension as to the object with which I applied for permission to visit Daly. As I understand, he stated that he did not know from me or anybody else that it was to be a purely professional and legal visit. I wrote to the right hon. Gentleman on the 4th of January stating that I had been engaged on behalf of some friends of Daly's to investigate his case and all the circumstances attending his conviction, that I had had an opportunity of
 452 "Telegram received; Secretary of State cannot sanction any relaxation of the rules relating to a professional visit to a convicted criminal prisoner." 453
*(9.44.)  MR. JOSEPH C. BOLTON  (Stirling) : I beg to move to reduce the Vote by the sum of £2,000, as a protest against the high salaries paid to prison chaplains in England as compared with those paid to chaplains in Scotland and Ireland. The salaries paid to the first-class chaplains in England range from £350 to £450 a year, while the salaries of first-class chaplains in Scotland are only £200 and £300; and the highest salary paid to any chaplain in Ireland is £200 per annum. In England the second-class chaplains begin at £300 and rise to £400, or £200 more than the highest salary paid in Ireland to any chaplain. In England assistant chaplains are paid a salary at the commencement of their services of £250, rising to £300, so it would appear that assistant chaplains in England are considered more efficient public servants than first-class-chaplains in Scotland, and, of course, greatly superior to first-class chaplains in Ireland. Some three years ago the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury admitted the necessity of a revision of the salaries paid to chaplains in English prisons, and in a subsequent year he practically admitted the anomaly, and took credit to himself for the possibility of correcting it without adding to the salaries in Scotland and Ireland. I do not know whether he has attempted to revise these salaries and finds it impossible to do so, and I am sorry he is not in his place to give an explanation of the absence of a revision, and in his absence I think it only remains for me to move the Amendment of which I have given notice.
 *MR. JOSEPH C. BOLTON : I hope that the Home Secretary will re-consider the matter, and give some assurance that the salaries of the Scotch chaplains will be placed on a more equitable footing. In the case of one English prison whore there is a daily average of 224 prisoners, there is a third-class chaplain employed and one Roman Catholic priest. I would ask if the Roman Catholic priest serves any number of prisoners, because if he does I suppose they must be deducted from the 224?
*(9.55.)  MR. JOSEPH C. BOLTON : The right hon. Gentleman is quite right when he assumes that my desire is to raise the salaries of Scotch chaplains, not to reduce the salaries of English chaplains. If the right hon. Gentleman maintains that English chaplains are not overpaid, then he supports my contention that Scotch chaplains are underpaid. It is not in my power to move an increase to the Vote, so I am driven to the usual expedient of moving a reduction when calling attention to the grievance. The right hon. Gentleman has referred to the number of prisoners in English prisons, but he has omitted to mention that in many of these prisons there are also assistant chaplains and Roman Catholic priests assisting in the ministrations to prisoners. It is not very easy for one who does not know all the details to make a correct comparison, but it is perfectly evident from the short statement of the right hon. Gentleman, and from what the Secretary to the Treasury has previously said, that there is an anomaly in the scale of payment which requires remedy. The right hon. Gentleman admits that at Barlinnie Prison the chaplain is underpaid. Under the circumstances, and unless the right hon. Gentleman can give us some promise of revision, I must persist in my Motion.
 MR. ROWNTREE : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if his attention has been called to the statement in the Appendix to the 46th Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy, as to the Yorkshire North Riding Asylum, in which the Commissioners say—
 "We gather that there is not any Roman Catholic service here, although there are 72 patients of that faith";
 MR. ROWNTREE  (Scarborough) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education if his attention has been called to a statement in the Annual Report of the Science and Art Department just published, purporting to show from Returns received up to 10th May that the Council of the North Riding of the County of York (amongst other County Councils) has notified that the whole amount of their share of the residue under the Customs and Excise Act will be applied to technical education; and if it is the case that last year the North Riding County Council appropriated the whole of such share, and this year have decided to appropriate one-half to non-educational purposes?
 MR. COURTNEY  (Cornwall, Bodmin) : I think my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby is under a misapprehension. Why should you at, this period of the Session deprive private Members of their chance of getting Bills through? I do not see why the private Members' Bills should not be left in the position they were in before. It is quite true that the chance of passing them is a small one, but why should private Members be deprived of that chance?
 MR. ATHERLEY-JONES : In the absence of the Home Secretary, I was endeavouring to point out that the right hon. Gentleman is incorrect in his view of the effect of the Prisons Act of 1877, and I gather from your ruling, Sir, that I am expected to give some ground for that statement. In the 9th section of that Act it is provided that the Prisons-Commissioners shall exercise all the powers that were formerly vested in Visiting Justices, and that the Commissioners shall conform to the directions which may from time to time be given to them by the Secretary of State. The Visiting Justices had exercised a large suspensory power with regard to punishments. In 1838 the Marquess of Normanby, who was then Home Secretary, issued a Circular Letter to Visiting Justices pointing out to them that it was within their power to modify the conditions of imprisonment for prisoners charged with political offences. A Return was afterwards issued showing that, in accordance with that Circular, a material change was made in the treatment, as, for instance, in the case of Monmouth prisoners convicted of riotous conduct and certain offences against public order. So there is a  primâ facie 477 478 non possumus
(9.12.)  MR. ATHERLEY-JONES  (Durham, N.W.) : In accordance with your suggested ruling, Sir, I may say a few words on the assumption that the Homo Secretary is incorrect in his view of what the law is in regard to Prison Rules. I am bound to say that I think my hon. Friend who introduced this question is entitled—
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W.) : I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the account of the accident referred to, as given by the hon. Member; but the injured man was, as a matter of fact, promptly taken off for surgical treatment, and I do not think this particular case could be quoted in support of the necessity of establishing the communication to which the hon. Member refers, however desirable it may be on other grounds.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH  said: I am not quite certain as to the date up to which the Report of the Board of Trade under the Conciliation Clause can be prepared; but I believe it will be presented before the close of the Session.
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I merely rise for the purpose of stating that I strongly sympathise with the views which the hon. Member has expressed, and perhaps the statement of them will suffice.
 *MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : It was my intention to have brought forward the claims of what I considered an underpaid English chaplain, who, however, has recently died. In voting in support of the Motion of my hon. Friend, I desire to be understood that I do not think that English chaplains are overpaid, but I would like to see an increase of the pay to Scotch chaplains in proportion to their responsible duties.
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, considering the great importance of the list

 *MR. CAUSTON : I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my question. I am certain that there would be no difficulty in obtaining a Return for the Metropolis.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War if the coal supplied to Maker Fort, Tregantle Fort, and Picklecombe Fort by Messrs. Harvey is North Country or Scotch; if the contract
 408
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I wish to say one or two words, because I also on one or two occasions have been brought in unfortunate conflict with the Chair. I concur in the suggestion of the hon. Member for West Belfast (Mr. Sexton), but for different reasons. I fear that such a dangerous precedent as this might be used in this way in the future. An hon. Member or some hon. Members might have a very important measure to bring forward touching the condition of the democracy, and it might possibly happen that the general feeling of the country was opposed to it. Then it might happen that that Member or group of Members, while observing the courtesy due to the Chair, would protest vigorously and at great length, and thereupon this precedent might be used to silence them. Without wishing to extenuate the conduct of the hon. Member for Boston, I beg to join in the protest so ably made by the hon. Member for West Belfast.
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I appeal to my hon. Friends behind me, and hope that there will be unanimity on the part of the House with regard to this Motion. I hope so for the sake of the hon. Member for Boston himself, for I am afraid that if we are not unanimous the hon. Gentleman will believe there is a minority which will support him when he comes back to the House, and that might encourage him to persist in the course which he has pursued. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has amended the Motion to an extent which I think Members on this side of the House may fairly accept.
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether he is aware that Messrs. Turner & Co., who have taken a contract for work at Buckingham Palace, have sub-let a portion of the work to Messrs. Parker & Co.; and that, in connection with work under this contract, the mechanics employed are being paid at the rate of 8½d. and their labourers at the rate of 5½d. per hour, which is less than the rate of wages generally accepted as current in each trade for competent workmen; and what steps he proposes to take, in regard to this contract, to carry out the Resolution of the House of 13th February?
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he is aware that A. Lethbridge, contractor for work at the Royal William Victualling Yard, Stonehouse, Devon, sub-let the painting to William Randel and Prowse, of Plymouth; and what was the minimum rate of wages paid by Mr. Lethbridge to the men employed under his contract for the different classes of labour?
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he is aware that, in connection with the new contract held by Messrs. Bramble Brothers for works and repairs of barracks, forts, &c, at Portsmouth, the rates of wages paid by them are for all mechanics at the rate of 6d., and for labourers at the rate of 3½d. per hour, whereas the rates of wages generally accepted and paid in Portsmouth are for mechanics 6½d. to 7d., and for labourers 4½d. an hour; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take in order to carry out the Resolution of this House of 13th February, that under future Government contracts the rates of wages paid should be those generally accepted as current in each trade for competent workmen?
 MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : I would point out that even if the three Bills referred to by the hon. Member pass this House this Session there is no chance of their passing the other House, and it would be better to give them the "happy despatch."
 MR. STERN  (Suffolk, Stowmarket) : I beg to postpone until Thursday my question—To ask the President of the Local Government Board whether complaint has been made to his Department in reference to the neglect of the Wood-bridge Rural Sanitary Authority to carry out the Sanitary Act in connection with the supply of pure water to Otley, in Suffolk; how many cases of illness and death from fever have occurred in that district during the last two years; and will the Local Government Board use its powers to compel the Local Authority to proceed at once with the necessary works?
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I would suggest that an exception should be made in favour of four or five private Members' Bills, which have reached almost the last stage.
 MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : Might I point out to the right hon. Gentleman that it would be more convenient, as the Indian Budget has been put off till so late, that it should not come immediately after the discussion of the Lords' Amendments to the Education Bill. In view of an impending famine in India there may be very important matters to be discussed upon the Indian Budget.
*(12.12.)  MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I beg to support the appeal of my hon. Friend. The condition and salaries of these clerks have been constantly brought forward before the House for many years past. In view of the representations which were made in this House, a Departmental Committee was appointed in 1888. The Report of that Departmental Committee has never been published, but it is understood the Committee reported in favour of the claims of these clerks. A Minute issued by the Scottish Secretary did not grant the claims put forward on the part of the engrossing clerks, though it did those of the commissioned clerks. The clerks naturally feel that if the Departmental Committee did report in favour of their claims, they ought to have some explanation from the Scottish Secretary and the Scottish Office as to the Report of the Departmental Committee, and why the distinction has been made between them and the commissioned clerks. I should also like to have some information from the Secretary to the Treasury or the Lord Advocate with regard to another branch in the Register House—namely, the Minute Book clerks, six in number. It is a small matter. They have presented a Memorial to the Secretary to the Treasury in which they represent that they can now only earn under the reorganisation an average of £130 or £140 instead of from £170 to £190. They think, and with justice, that it was never intended that they should suffer in this way for the reorganisation. It is a small matter; only six men are affected, three of whom have been in the Service since 1868–9. I would urge upon the Government that they should inquire why it is these
 503
*(12.35.)  MR. BUCHANAN : We must press for some information on this matter. As to the Treasury Minute, what took place was this: Six of these engrossing clerks were put on the permanent Civil Establishment; but it must be well-known to the right hon. Gentleman that ever since the Minute was published in 1881 there has been dissatisfaction in the office on the part not merely of the commissioned clerks, but of the engrossing clerks. In 1888 the Government took the very wise step of appointing the Special Committee referred to, the head of which was the very distinguished Judge, Lord Lee. We have never heard it stated to the House what the Report of that Committee was; but it is well known, and bas never been denied, that it reported generally in favour of the claim put forward, not merely by the commissioned clerks, but by the engrossing clerks. The Government have carried out the
 506
 *MR. BUCHANAN : But the abridgment clerks?
 *MR. BUCHANAN : I think we ought to have some further information. Three years ago the Departmental Committee, presided over by the late Lord Lee, reported upon the claims of these gentlemen; and though the Report was never made public, it is commonly asserted, and has never been denied, that the Report was in favour of those claims. The claim of the commissioned clerks has been granted, while that of the engrossing clerks has not been granted, and I want to know upon what ground this distinction has been made. Also, I should be glad to have some reply in relation to that limited class to which I have referred—the Minute Book clerks.
*(12.50.)  MR. BUCHANAN : I recognise the conciliatory tone of the right hon. Gentleman, especially with regard to the Minute Book Clerks, who are a comparatively small body of men. As to the other branch of the subject, the right hon. Member in his opening remarks adopted a somewhat unworthy argument. He knows whom the clerks are to whom the hon. Member refers. They are the engrossing clerks, who held appointments previous to 1879. He also knows very well that these clerks are 30 in number. Their position is an anomaly owing to the passing of the Lord Clerk Register Act of that year, and to the Treasury Minute, and to the action taken in that Minute. When the right hon. Gentleman tells us that he thought that Lord Lee's Committee had settled the whole matter he must have forgotten that during last Session, and during the present Session, a series of questions were put on the subject.
 *MR. BUCHANAN : I thought the hon. Member for Inverness-shire said he had put questions. At any rate we have not had information. Why, when the Committee reported generally in favour of these two Departments of clerks, has the Executive Authority sanctioned the Report in regard to one section of them, and not done so in regard to the other?
 MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether, in view of the increasingly serious reports with regard to impending famine in the North-West Provinces, Rajputana, and other districts in India, he will give the House the most recent information on the subject, and will state what steps the Government of India has taken to meet the distress and danger that may arise?
 MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the Foreign Office will direct Consuls to report as to the working of the system of employing the police as school attendance officers in Switzerland and other foreign countries?
 MR. T. ELLIS : I support the Amendment. Since the administration of the prisons has been centralised this is the only opportunity we have of calling attention to these anomalies, and this is worse than an anomaly. If the right hon. Gentleman is bound by Act of Parliament to nominate in a Nonconformist country only ministers of the Established Church, then I think the least those clergymen should do is to do their work, so far as prisons are concerned, for very much less pay than they now receive; and considering the little they have to do among the Welsh people, I think they might undertake this prison work for nothing. The same question crops up again in regard to work houses, but there local opinion has some sort of sway over nominations; but since 1877, since the centralising of prison control, this is the only opportunity we have of challenging the appointments. I hope my hon. Friend will press his Motion to a Division. 489
 MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : I hope the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary will give some answer to my hon. Friend.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : In view of the statement made by the Chief Secretary, I beg to give notice that I shall oppose the discussion of the Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill after 12 o'clock, at a time when hon. Members cannot have an opportunity of fully expressing their views, and when no reports can reach Ireland.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : In spite of the pledge that no contentious Bills should be taken?
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I should like to point out that one of the Irish Bills
 512
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : It is very refreshing to hear a condemnation of dilatory Motions from below the Gangway; it is a new feature in our Debates that I hope the Committee will appreciate. I take full responsibility for opposing this Bill, and I want to know what would have been said if any of us had attempted to force a Bill through at half-past 2 o'clock in the morning. Would not torrents of abuse have been poured on our heads from below the Gangway? I oppose the Bill mainly on the ground
 522
(2.4.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : The hon. and learned Member for Longford seems to imagine that he monopolises all the common sense in the House, but we do not appraise the hon. and learned Gentleman at his own value. He has introduced a tone and temper into this discussion no one else sought to import into it. It matters little to me what the opinion of the hon. and learned Gentleman is of my action, and I suppose the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite equally appreciate, the compliments of the hon. Member for West Belfast. I address myself to the Chief Secretary. The right hon. Gentleman knows as well as any man in the House that I have over and over again expressed my desire that this Bill should be discussed at an hour not only when it can be discussed and the discussion made public, but when Divisions can take place upon it. A discussion now will never go before the public; it will never reach Ireland. ["Oh, oh! All the better for you."] This money is to come out of the Church surplus in the first place; it is to be paid back over 30 years, but that Vote may be stopped any year, and then the endowment of Roman Catholic education will take place out of the Church surplus. I have examined the Bill day after day, and the more I examine it the less I like it, and the same is the case with the people of the North of Ireland. I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, in the face of the opposition of Members from Ulster and of English Members, he will insist at such an hour on forcing this Bill down out throats.
(1.34.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I am reluctantly compelled to move to report Progress. A pledge was given by the First Lord of the Treasury that no contentious measures should be taken after a certain date, yet a measure full of contention is sought to be forced through the House at 2 o'clock in the morning, when no one will have a chance of seeing what passes. The English as well as the Irish people are interested in this Bill, which proposes to hand over a practically unlimited sum of money to Archbishop Walsh and the Roman Catholic Church for the purpose of endowing denominational training colleges. It is not fair, nor just, nor reasonable on the part of the Government to force a Bill of this character through the House at this period of the Session, and at this late hour of the night. If the Chief Secretary desires to pass it, let him put it down so that we may discuss it at a proper hour, when the taxpayers of the country may have a chance of knowing what is being done.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I absolutely opposed the Second Reading, because the Chief Secretary gave no explanation of the Bill.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I approve of the course taken by the hon. Member for West Belfast, and think, if the conduct of the hon. Member for Boston had been judged simply from the speeches delivered from the two Front Benches, the impression conveyed would have been that the hon. Member had been actuated by malice. I hope I shall not be misunderstood. I deplore the conduct of the hon. Member during the past week, but everyone must have noticed that the hon. Member has been suffering from an abnormal amount of excitement, which has absolutely destroyed all his self-control. If the Resolution had been carried simply on the speeches from the two Front Benches it would have been grossly unfair to the hon. Member and to his constituents.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : What will be done with regard to the Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill?
 *COLONEL SANDYS  (Lancashire, S.W., Bootle) : I do not often speak on Irish Debates or separate myself from the lead of the Government, but this question has made issues outside the ties of Party allegiance, and as a supporter of the Government I would press upon my right hon. Friend the desirability of acceding to the Motion now before us. This is not a time to discuss a measure of this importance; there should be no suspicion of "hole and corner" work about a measure of this kind. The greatest dissatisfaction will, I am sure, arise in the country when it comes to be understood that Roman Catholic Colleges are practically to be endowed from the funds of the Protestant Church of Ireland, and I am sure the proposition will not redound to the credit of the Government bringing it forward. The Chief Secretary is acting from the highest motives, but I think he misconceives the situation. The Roman Catholic conspiracy is not to be dealt with by throwing out this sop, and I think the right hon. Gentleman does not realise that this species of placebo will fail in its object, but, in any case, the' Bill requires that open and full consideration which cannot be given to it now at this late hour and at the end of the Session when so few Members are present.
 *COLONEL SANDYS : I do not often interpose—[ Interruptions
 MR. SEXTON : Before the Motion is withdrawn, allow me to say that in my judgment the lurid eloquence of the hon. Member for South Tyrone is entirely misapplied. There has been no secrecy; no attempt to force anything. The Secretary for Ireland made a most reasonable proposal, and hon. Gentlemen who appear in opposition to the Bill declined to discuss it. The hon. Member for South Tyrone spoke of something refreshing in the speech of the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Galway (Colonel Nolan). What is refreshing and instructive is to find out how readily the Representatives of a certain section of Irishmen, who usually are in a great majority here, resort to obstruction when once in a way they find themselves in a minority. I am not ashamed to say, as an opponent of his, that the Chief Secretary has acted in a manner most creditable to him. The few words he has just addressed to the Committee were conceived in a conciliatory and statesmanlike spirit; but conciliation and statesmanship are thrown away on those who are his opponents now. He endeavoured to get rid of the only colourable reason that could be urged against the Bill, namely, that the fund of the Disestablished Church was going to be used in some measure for the purpose of Catholic education. The right hon. Gentleman offered to take the Irish Church Fund out of the Bill. Let it go forth to the country—let it go forth to Ireland, Protestants as well as Catholics—that a certain number of hon. Gentlemen, by dilatory and obstructive tactics, have endeavoured to prevent a Protestant statesman from applying to Ireland that equal treatment of training colleges out of Imperial funds, which for 40 years has, without question, been applied to the whole system of training colleges in England, Scotland, and Wales.
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I beg to move the adjournment of the Debate.
(2.10.)  MR. SEXTON : The hon. Gentleman is entitled to take what course he pleases, but he cannot expect us to accept his account of the contents

 MR. SEXTON : The hon. Member said he only wanted an opportunity of making a speech and dividing against the Bill, but he had no desire to prevent its passing. Let me point out money has been already given to this fund by

(1.37.)  MR. SEXTON : I have never heard a more reckless and misleading statement than that made by the hon. Member, who has turned a most astounding somersault. On the Second Reading he said his opposition was only formal.
 MR. SEXTON : May I ask when the Bill will be taken again?
 MR. SEXTON : The Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill must be taken some night, and although it is confronted by the formidable opposition of the hon. Member I hope we shall get it advanced a stage to night.
(1.4.)  MR. SEXTON : We are willing to sit up late, but the question is to what hour does the Government require the sitting prolonged. The Scotch Members may reasonably object to going on with the Scotch Estimates after 1 o'clock. Hitherto the suspension of the 12 o'clock rule has only applied to Supply, but now it has been agreed to for the purpose of enabling other Bills, including some Irish Bills, to be advanced a stage. I shall, in view of the desirability of getting on with those Bills, resist any further progress being made with the Scotch Votes to-night.
 MR. SEXTON : I have heard the statement of the hon. Member for South Tyrone with great surprise, because he allowed the Second Reading to pass without dissent. The hon. Member will have no difficulty in expressing his views
 440
(6.46.)  MR. SEXTON : This question was discussed to some extent last year upon the Home Office Vote, and it is distinctly within my memory that the Home Secretary made a more favourable response than he has given to-day. He did not then come to the unchangeable conclusion at which he has arrived to-day. I regret that the Debate was not raised upon the Vote for the Home Department, because we would then have been able to deal exhaustively with the various considerations in the case. The Home Secretary has the prerogative of clemency, and we would have been able to bring before him evidence such as would have entitled him to ask for the clemency of the Crown. On the Prisons Vote we are limited strictly to the question whether the Commissioners within their discretion have acted properly or improperly. Whether by inadvertence or not I do not know, but the right hon. Gentleman did not refer to the letters sent to him by the hon. Member for North Wexford. The hon. Member has read the letter, which states that he wished to see Daly on professional and legal business. I certainly think the hon. Member was entitled to complain, even with more energetic language than he used, of the treatment which he has received at the hands of the right hon. Gentleman. It is not a light thing for a professional man, who thinks he has permission to see the prisoner, to come across the Irish Sea and across this country to Portland Prison only to find that he will merely be allowed to see the prisoner in the presence of two warders. There has been a want of businesslike arrangement in connection with the whole affair, and I think the Home Secretary should give some explanation. I claim that the hon. Member for North Wexford should be allowed to see the prisoner. Daly and the other men have undeniably suffered grievously in these prisons, because of the prejudice which exists against them in connection with the offence of which they were convicted. No one

 MR. SEXTON : How does it happen that when the right hon. Gentleman came to the conclusion to allow these interviews the prison officials were not informed of it?
 MR. SEXTON : There is a feeling on this side of the House that it is desirable to have, if possible, a unanimous vote. Naturally, as far as the Speaker is concerned, we should feel pained if we were to give a vote which might be mis-
 433
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I feel it to be my duty to say that I do not concur in the Motion. I admit without reserve that Mr. Speaker, in the circumstances in which he found himself, had no other course open to him but that which he has taken; the House will unanimously sympathise with him in the position in which he found himself, and will feel that the conduct of the hon. Member has been in a high degree reprehensible. I think, however, that the Members of the House who have observed the conduct of the hon. Member for Boston will feel that his faults and errors are due rather to lack of self-repose and to incapacity for perfect self-control than to any disposition to be disrespectful to the Chair. The errors of the hon. Member are due to impulse and not to malice. In the scenes in which the hon. Member has borne a prominent and regrettable part he seems to have been moved by a feeling which he sincerely believed to be quite justifiable; he was intrusted, in some degree, with the care of an important interest, and that feeling, in his mind, operated perhaps to an extent which many of us cannot justly estimate. It has led him into acts and words with regard to the Chair which cannot be justified, and which the hon. Member himself in cooler moments will most deeply regret. As an Irish Member and one who has had to go through painful experiences in trying times, I wish to say that Mr. Speaker has been sometimes placed in difficult relations. But I feel bound to say that, however much we may have felt at the moment aggrieved by any action he took, we never doubted that his kindness of heart and dignity of disposition made him superior to anything like unfair or discourteous treatment of any Member. That unqualified testimony will, I hope, remove any doubt as to the feeling which animates me in the course I feel bound to take now. I think the Resolution is harsh, and that it is in excess of the necessities of the case. Any one who has observed the hon. Member for Boston will feel

 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland if the Government is aware that since June, 1889, legal proceedings have been instituted in the County of Londonderry by the Salters' Company, London, against 250 of their former tenants (purchasers in 1886 under the Ashbourne Act) for the recovery of arrears of rent and interest due 1st November, 1884, and 1st November, 1885; that decrees in all cases were granted, and thus the Company have either obtained payment or hold decrees capable of being at once executed for £2,500; that, subsequently, Mr. John M'Guiggan, of Ballynagaire, appealed, and that Judge Holmes, at the recent Derry Assizes, reversed the decree; but, as no appeals are possible in the other cases, will the Government enforce the decrees still outstanding, or take steps to provide that the money already paid under threat of legal proceedings being returned to those 250 tenant purchasers?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Will the right hon. Gentleman address a question to the Salters' Company on the subject?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I presume we may take it for granted that no new Bill will be introduced.
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I do not think it is in the power of a Minister, having obtained a concession from the House in regard to Supply on a distinct pledge that he would not persevere with it in the case of any important Vote after a given hour, to say when he obtains larger powers as to general business, that it is in his power to retract his pledge. I am quite sure the right hon. Gentleman will say he will not persist against the general feeling of the House with any Vote. If so, no doubt no opposition will be offered to this alteration in his view. As to the proposal with regard to new legislation, I do not know what Bills have been passed by the House of Lords, but a most objectionable practice has grown up of sending down a batch of Lords' Bills after the general body of members interested in them has gone away. I would suggest the insertion of the words "and in the case of Bills already introduced" before "may be entered upon." This would prevent the application of the Motion to Bills not yet introduced into this House. I do not suppose anybody in the House would be so stupid as to oppose a Bill like that of the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Agriculture (Mr. Chaplin) with regard to fertilisers, as it is intended to serve the interests of the agricultural community generally. There are Bills frequently introduced by the Treasury at the end of the Session which, like the Public Works Loans Bill of last year, contain a mass of contentious matter. I beg to move the Amendment I have suggested.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : No Lords' Bills.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Are prisoners when visited allowed to discuss the circumstances of their conviction?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Will the right hon. Gentleman say why the ordinary rule as to removal was not followed in this case?
(6.56.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I am very glad that this entire question can be raised on the Appropriation Bill, and that it will not be necessary to deal with it in a piecemeal manner on this Vote. I asked the right hon. Gentleman several questions with regard to the treatment of Daly in Chatham Prison, and the right hon. Gentleman twice laid down that Chatham Prison was the proper prison for Daly, and that he was very well treated in that prison, although he had three times been nearly poisoned.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : He had three excessive doses of belladonna, and if that is not being three times nearly poisoned I do not know what is. The right hon. Gentleman stated to me in the month of May that some suggestion would be made for a separate classification, or some kind of division, at Chatham Prison, but beyond that he would not go. Now I have to ask why it is that John Daly has been removed—I am glad he has been removed; I am not making it a complaint—but why was he removed to Portland? Considering the abominable language proved to have been used by the warders at Chatham, which stands

"Has your health been good?—It has been very good. Is there any matter which you wish to bring before us?—Nothing with regard to my treatment, or anything of that sort. Perhaps this might not be the place to make a request for something that I wish to obtain. Would it be out of place here?—We have only power to make recommendations; we have no power to' grant anything.—It was with regard to a special book which, perhaps, would hardly be granted to me, that would be possibly out of place here?—We will consider it." "I am a sailor, and have been a sailor all my time, and I have been a good deal about the Spanish Main, and I intend, if I ever get my liberty, to go to South America; I do not want to go to any place where I have been before; I intend to go to Chili or Valparaiso. I had some knowledge of the Spanish language before I began my sentence. Twelve months ago the chaplain kindly allowed me a grammar and a dictionary of the Spanish language. He came to the cell door and handed them to me and spoke very kindly to

I have been a great deal better since I have taken to the study of this language. I have an object. I was very well treated here, but I had no object, and under the very best circumstances the life of a prisoner is somewhat irksome.

 MR. T. M. HEALY : I ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I shall not oppose this, but I may point out that it raise" a very important contention. The phrase "a full agricultural rent," would include a rent on the tenant's own improvements, and I should prefer to see the words, "a fair rent within the meaning of the said Acts."
 MR. T. M. HEALY : In fairness to the Government, I should like to point out an error of drafting in the second line, which, unless it is altered, will let in the tenants for whom the Bill is not intended.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : The hon. Member says the Bill will set up denominational training colleges. Does he not know that such training colleges already exist and are supported by the State? Then, how it can be said that this Bill will set them up requires a Falkirk intellect to understand. It appears to me that this Motion is what the late Lord Beaconsfield called a "reconnaissance in force," aimed not at the Bill, but at something very different. The Government having brought in a minimum measure ought not to be intimidated by the hon. Member for Falkirk. We are sitting to a late hour, but this delay will simply prolong the Session. I shall be glad to hear what the Government propose to do.
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : Where are all the godly men who supported the Government in the last Division? They have gone home to their beds. We are here, and we are going to remain here; and with regard to every Bill on the Paper, we will give the Government fits. We have been treated, as we consider, in a most unfair manner in respect to the Training Colleges Bill, because of the objection two or three Orangemen entertain to the Bill. I object to making progress at this hour of the morning with the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, which contains 25 measures that are highly contentious and debatable. If hon. Gentlemen opposite really desire to make progress with legislation they must adopt the principle of give and take.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : We cannot defeat the Motion that the Chairman do leave the Chair, because the Government, I suppose, will support it, but when the Motion to report Progress is made, we can divide, and for my part I will divide. I may point out that when Local Government for Ireland comes to be discussed the Chief Secretary may find himself in exactly the same predicament as he is in now. I think the Government might have shown a little more firmness on this occasion. In any event, I hope that when the Bill is taken again, it will be taken as the first Order.
 MR. JACKSON : I have promised to make my statement on these points tomorrow.
(12.54.)  MR. JACKSON : I think it is admitted that the office is over-manned, the number of clerks being in excess of the requirements of the public service. It is part of the arrangement that on consideration of certain improvements in the position of these clerks when vacancies arise, the number shall be reduced. I do not think it would have been possible to have admitted to these ranks a large number of clerks only employed in temporary service in the sense of only being paid according to the amount of work done. The copyists are paid according to the work they do.
 MR. JACKSON : I have no recollection of any question having been put to me since the Report of the Commission.
(12.46.)  MR. JACKSON : I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman opposite and I are not discussing the same item, if the hon. Member is correct about his 13 engrossing clerks. The item I refer to is an item of £7,000 for copying.
*(12.32.)  MR. JACKSON : I am very sorry that the hon. Member should have thought it necessary to address the Committee in the tone he has done. All I want to point out is that the hon. Member has misunderstood the Minute. I say again, that if he will make inquiries he will find that copying clerks were not put on the Establishment by this Minute.
 MR. JACKSON : The hon. Member spoke about 13 engrossing clerks, and, as I understood, went on to assert that they were the same as those to whom I had referred, who come under the head of copying, and for whom a round sum
 508
 MR. JACKSON : There is a note in the Estimates saying that the clerks are to be reduced as vacancies arise.
 MR. JACKSON : I am sorry I did not convey to the hon. Member my meaning. I am willing to admit—if that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman—that I am ignorant on the question of these Minute clerks. I have promised to look into the matter, and, when the Vote comes up on Report to-morrow, to give full and complete information in regard to it. I stated that I had not with me the papers relating to the clerks whom I suppose he speaks of as engrossing clerks. I would assure him that I had no intention of answering him curtly or with any want of courtesy, and I should be sorry if I thought I had.
(12.22.)  MR. JACKSON : It is quite certain that the engrossing clerks are not in the Treasury Minute to which the hon. Member refers. They are simply clerks who are paid by piecework. They are not on the establishment of the Civil Service, and they are practically in the same position as copyists in other branches of the Civil Service in this country.
 *MR. JACKSON : They were not the men employed in the copying work. If the hon. Member will look at the Estimate he will find that there is a sum of money taken for copying. The money is paid according to the amount of work done, and I can assure the hon. Member that he is mistaken that the Treasury Minute placed these copyists on the Establishment as the Establishment of the Civil Service. To do that would be to put the clerks in the position of being entitled to pension. These copyists are not entitled to pensions.
 MR. MACARTNEY : If I do not object to this, I hope the Labourers (Ireland) Act will not be opposed.
(1.56.)  MR. SINCLAIR  (Falkirk) : The Chief Secretary, by his speech, has opened up a very wide question. It is believed that by this Bill a great blow is going to be struck at the mixed system of education in Ireland, which we who are anxious for the welfare of Irish education desire to see preserved. It will set up denominational training colleges, to which we are opposed. This is not a question which ought to be dealt with at the fag end of a Session, and I, therefore, support the Motion to report Progress.
 MR. SUMMERS  (Huddersfield) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he is aware that on 29th April, 1889, the University for London Commission reported that—
 "A reasonable time should be allowed to the Senate and Convocation of the University of London to consider whether they will apply to Her Majesty for a new charter in accordance with the suggestions contained in Report of the Commission"; "In the event of their applying for and obtaining such a new charter, no other University can now be established in London, and that the prayer of the petition of University and King's College be not granted"; 411
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I understand the difficulty to be in reference to Bills, not being Government Bills, that are not opposed. I know the difficulty there sometimes is of distinguishing between opposed and unopposed Bills, and I think the best course to take at this late period of the Session is to lay down that no business shall be taken except Government business.
(4.59.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : I also must oppose that Bill. It seems to me that there is no disposition to refuse to accept the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for, according to Moore's verse, with a little alteration—
 "The best of all ways to shorten our days Is to steal a few hours from the night." 437
 SIR W. HARCOURT : That being so, and feeling that it is our duty to vindicate your office, and to vindicate the character of the House of Commons, I think that all of us who have been witnesses of what has been taking place for many days past in the conduct of the hon. Member for Boston have no option but to support the Motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I make no doubt that, after the painful scenes we have witnessed, not only today, but I may say for many days past, the House will feel that it was not even necessary that you, Sir, should make the statement which you have felt it your duty to make in order to convince the House that the conduct of the hon. Member for Boston has been a scandal to the House of Commons.
(5.25.)  SIR W. HARCOURT : It really is not a kindness to private Members
 442
(6.10.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I desire to interpose a few words on the general question before the answer of the Home Secretary is given. All I can say is that if any circumstances which ought to lead to the reconsideration of the sentences or the treatment of any prisoner come up, I certainly should be the last to stand in the way. During my administration of the Home Office I over and over again re-considered matters when there was any ground for re-consideration. Therefore, on those grounds generally I have
 450
 SIR W. HARCOURT : Of course, I bow to the ruling of the Chair, but I am bound to make some explanation with reference to the statement made by the hon. Member for Cork, which would otherwise go forth without any explanation. The hon. Member in his speech said that Daly himself admitted the possession of dynamite, and never from first to last, as far as I know, has Daly until this time disputed any of the facts alleged against him.

(11.17.)  MR. WALLACE : There is a very great difference in this House between what may be called logical relevancy and practical relevancy. In the matter of logical relevancy I can see the Home Secretary is right, but in practical relevancy I can see he is wrong. I mean to stick to the practical relevancy in this matter, and I regret that my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness has not announced his intention of taking a Division, for the simple reason that there is no possibility of getting justice to Scotland, or for any community that is smaller than the English community, unless we take ourselves to processes that are more open to practical recommendation than to logical conclusion. I want to know why the English salaries have been increased, while those in Scotland have been allowed to stand still? I think the Scottish Law Officers of the Crown who are present have very feebly stood by the rights and interests of Scotland, when an inequality of this description is presented to the House, and is not dealt with argumentatively by the financial authorities on the Treasury Bench.
 MR. WALLACE  (Edinburgh, E.) : Do I understand that the right hon. Gentleman has nothing to do with the Scotch chaplains? I would ask whether there is any responsible Member of the Government who has to do with the Scotch prisons?
 MR. WALLACE : I am sorry to have to undergo the mortification of agreeing for once with my hon. Friend the Member for South Tyrone and differing from our friends from Ireland. Strong anti-denominationalist as I am, I have always protested, and shall continue to protest, against denominational endowment as applied to educational affairs. This Bill seems to me to be an extension of denominational education in a certain part of the Empire, and, therefore, I require more time to consider it. For that reason I shall support the Motion to report Progress. 521
 MR WALLACE : Shall we learn anything as to the Report of Lord Lee's Committee?
(12.57.)  MR. WALLACE : The right hon. Gentleman does not even yet understand the elements of the position. He is arguing this matter as a question of economic administration, but that is not the question at all. The question is one of the historical claims of certain individuals, and the right hon. Gentleman by an instinctive dexterity tries to confuse the historic argument with this question of economic administration. I decline to allow him to confuse the two subjects. The right hon. Gentleman is trying not to bring light into our minds, but to throw dust in our eyes, and I must tell him that that experiment is one which depends for its success very much upon the quality of the dust he throws, and the nature of the eyes he tries to throw it into. I say to him that the engrossing clerks had a certain claim at a particular

 MR. WALLACE : I did not mention any item.
(12.39.)  MR. WALLACE : I am perfectly astonished at the immovability of the right hon. Gentleman under the appeal of the hon. Member for West Edinburgh. Nothing could have been put in a more conciliatory manner, or in a way more fitted to evoke a declaration from an official willing to give information to those who have a right to expect information on this matter. The right hon. Gentleman has sailed off again on a simple denial. He tells me that I am wrong in my interpretation of the Treasury Minute, but he does not show me that I am wrong. He merely says so. I say "Yes," and he says "No." Is that fitting discussion in an assembly such as this? I say it is not, and my way of argument is as good as that of the right hon. Gentleman. The thing is reduced to a nursery argument. That is the way children in a nursery argue. The one says it is, and the other says it is not. What satisfaction can be got for the promotion of public business in argumentation of that kind? The right hon. Gentleman has some dim and remote understanding of the history of this matter, because he jumped to a certain particular half-dozen of clerks who are placed in a peculiar position by this Minute.
 507
(12.27.)  MR. WALLACE : The treatment to which we are now being subjected by the right hon. Gentleman is most contemptuous. He seems to think we are to accept his  ipse dixit Sic volo, sic jubeo stet pro ratione voluntas
(12.15.)  MR. WALLACE : I am not generally in favour of any movement the effect of which would be to add to the Estimates, but in this particular case I really wish to have some explanation why these engrossing clerks should not be on the same footing as certain other clerks whose claims have been acknowledged. It is exceedingly difficult to understand the affairs of the Sasines Office; but my hon. Friend has sounded the depths and fathomed the difficulties, and his opinion is that the engrossing clerks ought under Statute to have the same footing as commissioned clerks, and I agree with him. Such documents as have been made public may be quoted in favour of my hon. Friend's contention. In the Treasury Minute of 1881 it is distinctly laid down that the abridgment clerks are to be put on the permanent establishment of the Department. The position of the abridgment clerks includes the engrossing clerks.
(11.41.)  MR. WALLACE : I have no wish to move a substantial reduction in the Vote; but in regard to the offices of Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland, I must say that the salaries are remarkably small compared with those of the Attorney General and Solicitor General for England. Certainly, the Government get good value for their money in their Law Officers, and I am, therefore, unable to understand the arithmetical principles on which the difference is made. But there is one item in the Vote—a comparatively

 MR. WALLACE : I understand that if the Scotch officials are able to bring forward certain special circumstances certain particular modifications and certain diversities in connection with their claims they will possibly be as successful as the English officials. I shall be content under the present circumstances to refrain from further opposition to the passing of this Vote.
(11.27.)  MR. WALLACE : I understand from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the reason why the English applicants have been more favoured than their Scotch brethren is that they have been more importunate.
 *SIR A. ROLLIT  (Islington, S.) : Having known the hon. Member for Boston all his life, and having been associated with him in Parliamentary and municipal matters for many years, I should like to say a word in favour of a modification of the Motion, which should be at once unanimous and considerate. I have had opportunities of forming some estimate of the influences acting on the hon. Member throughout the last few days; and when I use the word "considerate," I think it is the one which is most applicable to the case. My private knowledge of the associations of the hon. Member leads me to take the view that one week's exclusion will be sufficient to attain the object in view.
 MR. A. PEASE  (York) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the Government have received any Reports as to the condition of the Coolies in British Guiana since the removal of the late Inspector to a subordinate position in the hospitals, and whether the status of the medical officers is virtually fixed by the elective members of the Combined Court of Policy, although the Coolies are nominally under Imperial protection?
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the Commissioners or Judges to be appointed under the permanent Act recently arranged with the delegates from Newfoundland for carrying out the  modus vivendi
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : If we assume that the Scotch chaplains are properly paid, it follows that the English chaplains are overpaid, and the personal experience of my hon. Friend seems to indicate that in English prisons the clergyman does not always do his duty.
 MR. MORTON : I hope the right hon. Gentleman is going to give us some answer to the case put forward. I do not profess to thoroughly understand the question, but surely we are entitled to some explanation from the Home Secretary with regard to the charges made by the hon. Member for Donegal (Mr. A. O'Connor). As far as I can understand the Estimates, we amply protect those who receive large salaries, and show little consideration for the men in receipt of small stipends. Such a state of things is to be greatly deprecated.
 MR. MORTON : It seems from the Estimates that the right hon. Gentleman has power to appoint a visiting Presbyterian clergyman as well as Roman Catholic priests. If that is the case the right hon. Gentleman can surely appoint a Baptist, Wesleyan, or other Noncomformist chaplain in Wales.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Are we to understand that even where the majority of the people do not belong to the Church of England the Home Secretary is obliged to appoint clergymen of the Church of England as prison chaplains?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I desire to ask as to the fees received by the Legal Secretary to the Lord Advocate?
 SIR H. MAXWELL : The hon. Member has not stated in his question the branch of the postal or telegraph service with which he thinks the engineering branch of the telegraph service should be put on a level, and I am therefore quite unable to say whether any or what concession will be granted or withheld.
 *A LORD OF THE TREASURY (Sir HERBERT MAXWELL  (Wigton) : I have
 399
 *SIR H. MAXWELL : We have no powers to compel the Railway Company to do as the hon. Member requires, and the riparian owners and others have their remedy at law for any damage caused.
 *SIR H. MAXWELL : To answer completely the question of the hon. Member would necessitate inquiry in each Department of the Public Service. I can, therefore, only undertake to reply in a general sense and subject to reasonable reserve. In the first place, men transferred in ordinary course are transferred in accordance with the exigencies of the Public Service. Secondly, men transferred on promotion would not lose seniority, and under reasonable conditions would receive an allowance in respect of removal expenses; but the same rule would not apply to men transferred for their own convenience or as a punishment. Thirdly, in the case of a man transferred the time served by him in the same capacity at the port or station which he leaves would not militate against the man so transferred. Fourthly, as a general rule, promotion in the Public Service is hold to depend upon merit.
(5.3.)  SIR H. DAVEY  (Stockton) : I should like to ask whether the Government will take the Betting and Loans (Infants) Bills. There is, I think, a very general feeling in their favour.
 SIR H. DAVEY : As I find there is considerable opposition to the Chartered Accountants Bill I will not proceed with it this Session.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : My information on this subject corresponds with what has appeared in the newspapers—that she has been removed from where she was and taken to the house of the Governor. Arrangements are being made for an inquiry as to her personal wishes, where there will be no coercion exercised with regard to her.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Considering that the system in question is inapplicable to this country, the Report proposed would not be of practical value, and would not justify the cost and trouble of procuring it, unless this House should desire to have it.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : The case of Mrs. Barker has formed the subject of frequent correspondence. The questions in dispute have given rise to a long and complicated lawsuit. Mrs. Barker's opponent at one period attempted to enforce his claim by force, and was punished on the representations of the British Ambassador by dismissal from the Government Service. Allegations have been made on Mrs. Barker's behalf as to improper influence over the tribunals, but they have not been substantiated. Further instructions are not required, as the British Diplomatic and Consular officers, while unable to interfere with the action of the constituted Law Courts, have been unwearied in their efforts to assist Mrs. Barker to the extent of their powers. Recent information from Constantinople shows that Mrs. Barker is instructing her legal adviser in communication with the British Embassy.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : My right hon. Friend, in whose absence I answer the question, says—I have with me the latest telegrams about the crop and famine prospects. They are dated the 24th of July, and as they appeared in Saturday's newspapers, I do not know that it is necessary to read them. A further telegram is expected to-morrow; and thereafter weekly telegrams will be sent every Friday as long as cause for anxiety continues. The telegrams will be sent to the newspapers. As regards the preparations for dealing with famine, the Secretary of State is in telegraphic communication with the Viceroy, whom he has urged to take without delay every necessary precaution for the relief of distress, and from whom he has heard that adequate arrangements have been made for all contingencies anticipated. In all the threatened British provinces famine Codes have been issued, and plans have been drawn up for dealing with distress caused by famine. Funds are available for meeting the cost of relief; and in

 SIR J. FERGUSSON : Information has been received from Sir E. Baring of the existence of such a slave trade as that mentioned. It is, however, his opinion that the Egyptian Government is doing everything in its power to prevent it. The frontiers at Wady Haifa and other stations are carefully watched, and the surveillance at Suakin and other ports on the Red Sea Coast is, in my opinion, as efficient as it is in the power of the Egyptian Government to make it. They are also assisted by the gunboats of Her Majesty's Navy. Early in the year about 60 slaves were taken to the Governor of Suakin by Arab Sheikhs and liberated. The occupation of Tokar dealt a heavy blow to the slave trade, and immediately after the fall of Handoub important arrests were made of notorious slave dealers.
 MR. LYELL  (Orkney and Shetland) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, in view of the increased work thrown on the Crofter Commission by recent legislation, and the probability that these new duties will further delay the Court in dealing with the applications for fair rents in the highlands and islands, the Government will appoint additional Commissioners who may be empowered to deal with the new duties, and so leave the original members of the Commission free to dispose of the applications for fair rents at a more rapid rate; and whether representations have reached him that the long delay in settling what are fair rents in the highlands and islands is injurious both to crofters and landowners, and that a prompt settlement is most urgently needed?
 MR. LYELL : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he can say when the telegraph line to Heylor, in Shetland will be established?
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : No general answer can be given to the hon. Member's question, as it depends upon the nature of the decisions and the circumstances under which they were given. If the hon. Member will communicate with me with reference to the circumstances of any particular case, I shall be pleased to render him any assistance in my power.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (SIR R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : This is simply a Bill to continue Acts which must be continued; it is a purely formal Bill, as hon. Gentlemen know, and effective discussion can only take place on the Schedule.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : And Roman Catholics?
 MR. S. T. EVANS : It is not a matter of pay, but of appointing them from one sect. All the chaplains belong to the Church of England.
 MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : The right hon. Gentleman says he has nothing to do with the Scotch prison chaplains, but he cannot say that he has nothing to do with the Welsh prison chaplains. Fortunately, there are not many prisons in the Principality, and there are now fewer than there used to be. Bat there is one thing about the chaplains—they are all of one
 484
(10.30.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : I wish to call attention to the item of £750 for prison chaplains in Wales, and to move the reduction of the Vote by that amount. I find that, besides Roman Catholic clergymen, a visiting Presbyterian receives a stipend, and I therefore want to know why the Nonconformists should not be allowed to have chaplains? If the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary is bound by Act of Parliament to dispense this favouritism, I think that, at any rate, we have a right to call on the ministers of the Established Church to perform these functions for nothing. I move to reduce the Vote by the sum of £150.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : I will see what can be done in the direction indicated without unduly adding to the complexity of the information given in the Appendices to the Report.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : The Department have received but very little further information since the compilation of the statement made on page 51 of the Report, and I think it would be better to wait till the beginning of next year, when a full and exhaustive list of the operations of the County Councils for the current financial year can be issued.
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford) : The statement in the Annual Report was compiled from the best information obtainable at the time; but it is possible that subsequent changes have been made by the Local Authorities, in the appropriation of the grant, which have not been communicated to the Department.
 *SIR J. GORST : The Secretary of State does not at present contemplate taking the initiative in this matter, nor has he received any communication from the Government of India on the subject.
(4.10.)  DR. MCDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : I do not propose to go into figures, as they have already been put before the Committee by my hon. Friend. The average size of a holding in a crofter district is 3½ acres, and I find that in the cases dealt with by the Commissioners in Ross-shire they have made reductions of rent equal to 40 per cent.; but they have not gone far enough in reducing rents. Whatever blame attaches to the present Government in the matter attaches equally to their predecessors. Why on earth should not persons be employed who are acquainted with the land and know its value? An intelligent crofter knows the value much better than a large farmer or an ordinary factor. The lowest point to which the Commissioners have reduced the rent in cases where the crofters have made the land is 7s. 6d. per acre. I am acquainted with a case in my own county where a man who made every inch of the land himself is compelled to pay a rent of 7s. 6d. an acre. I do not see how anybody can justify a charge of 7s. 6d. for bog-land. I may say frankly that when the Commissioners commenced
 564
(4.48.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : There is a very strong feeling that there has been a total and entire failure to give any material enlargement of agricultural holdings. I do not blame the Commissioners, because I believe they are tied up so tightly in many ways that it is absolutely impossible for them to do more. The Government have tackled the question of the congested districts in Ireland, and I hope that they will now take into consideration the expediency and necessity of applying a similar measure to Scotland. There is much ground for improvement in regard to enlargement of agricultural and mixed holdings. The crofter population is not very large compared with the population of the Irish congested districts, and the Government ought to speedily relieve the difficulties which press upon this small portion of the people of Scotland.
 THE CHAIRMAN : That is a question outside the scope of the matter before the Committee.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! An Amendment has been moved with respect to the valuers.
 DR. MCDONALD : I do not see why crofters should not be made valuers. There are plenty of intelligent men among the crofters who would be quite capable of acting as valuers. Some such compromise would work very smoothly indeed. I put it to the House, is it fair to charge 7s. 6d. per acre for black moorland, as has been done in plenty of cases? We know that in this country now the desire is to keep the people on the land by granting allotments and so on, but in the Highlands the policy we have been accustomed to is that of emigrating our people.
 MR. T. M. HEALT : Why should they go out of their own districts?
 MR. STUART WORTLBY : There is, I understand, a matron employed at each Court, and the Chief Commissioner has given instructions to the officers in charge of police stations to call in female servants where work has to be done amongst female prisoners.
 DR. MCDONALD : On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness-shire, I beg to move to insert in the clause after "gift." the words—
 "The County Councils may subscribe to any proposed harbour or pier from the sum granted to them by the first sub-section of the 22nd section of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1889."
 DR. MCDONALD : I cannot understand why the Lord Advocate should oppose this Amendment.
(1.30.)  DR. MCDONALD : Without the Amendment the Bill will be utterly useless in the poorer districts of the Highlands, as the people there cannot afford the cost of preparing the plans.
(1.37.)  DR. MCDONALD : On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, I move to insert in the clause, after "gift," the words—
 "The County Councils may subscribe to any proposed harbour or pier from the sum granted to them by the 1st sub-section of the 22nd section of 'The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.'"
(2.30.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I do not think the Government could do anything else but write off the debt of £120,000 owing by the Ulster Canal Company. The Commissioners, of whom I was one, pointed out that the canal was absolutely useless.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It would not be in order to do that in Committee. The canal has been sold to a company, and they have nothing to do with the debt of the old company.
(2.50.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : May I ask the Attorney General to be good enough to give us a short explanation of the Bill.
 DR. TANNER : Does the Bill apply to Malta?
 DR. TANNER : At this hour of the morning it is ridiculous to ask us to transact the business of the country, and, therefore, I beg to move that the House do now adjourn.
(11.5.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid.) : It struck me as highly amusing that the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary should have appealed to future generations, and said nothing whatever about the past. He seems to ignore the cruelty and oppression perpetrated on our unfortunate people. The hon. Member for North Longford has reminded us that in days gone by the Resident Magistrates were not removable; they were gentlemen then, and were not appointed merely for the purpose of suppressing Irish liberties; they possessed the confidence of the people and made the law respected. Now, however, we see Removable Magistrates brought into Ireland—men like Mr. O'Neill Segrave, who is responsible for the murders of Mitchelstown, and Colonel Caddell, who was brought from Africa at the request of the Prime Minister because he had had some dealings with the Hottentots, and, therefore, was supposed to be able to enforce the noble Lord's behests with regard to the Irish people. Prom the beginning to the end of the history of the mal-administration of Ireland there is nothing which so stigmatises the conduct of any Government as the appointment of these Removable Magistrates. Mr. Odder was brought from Clare, Mr. Gardner from Cork, Major Waring from another district, and Mr. Constadine and Mr. Bruin from elsewhere,
 616 Irish Times 617
 DR. TANNER : I should like to know, also, whether these Resident Magistrates are to be assembled in numbers and to outvote the unpaid Magistrates? If this be so, what is the use of appointing local Magistrates at all?
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if it is true that a number of relief works instituted by the Government in West and South Cork will be left unfinished, and that it is proposed to tax the cesspayers of the County of Cork, as suggested by the county surveyor to the West Riding of the County of Cork, to supply the alleged deficiency; and, if so, which of the works in course of construction will be left unfinished?
 DR. TANNER : It was at the right hon. Gentleman's own personal request that I put down the question a second time. On the first occasion the information was not fully afforded.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India if there is any foundation for the report from Bombay that a famine is regarded as inevitable in the North West Provinces in consequence of inadequate rainfall; and, if so, what steps are being taken, or will be taken, for the relief of distress?
 DR. CLARK : I wish merely to say that a number of these people are leaving their holdings, and the landlords have no right to consolidate the holdings. The crofters are being very much burdened in some cases by having to pay off arrears. Some of the valuers have acted in such a way that the rents have been reduced to a very fair figure, but others have taken a view which has left the crofters saddled with very high rents, and I therefore feel compelled to move the reduction of the salaries of these valuers by £100.
(5.1.)  DR. CLARK : I regret very much that the right hon. Gentleman and the Government will not do anything on this point. The 9,340 cases in which fair rents have been fixed, probably fairly well, meet the grievance as far as rents are concerned; but the people require more land. Applications for increases of holdings have been received from 401 persons, and only 14 of them, representing a value of £389, have been acceded to. The Court of Session has decided that when a lease that was in existence in 1886 expires, it is possible for the Commission to take a portion of the land. I must say for the northern landlords that, with one single exception, they have cheerfully submitted to the decisions of the Commissioners, and in that one case the crofters were put to an expense of £200. The Crown, I am sorry to say, is one of the worst landlords. Unfortunately it holds a lot of property in my county, but it is all in large farms, which are given to the pluralists. I think it would be better if the Crown let its land in farms of £50, or £80, or £100 a year. The land would then be beneficial to the people as a whole, instead of being beneficial merely to a few pluralists. Legislation is particularly

 DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he is aware that Mr. T. H. Stockwell, an official in the Telegraph Department of the General Post Office, has been for same time engaged in the business of a newspaper reporter during official hours; whether he is aware that a communication was forwarded to the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury last April by the Institute of Journalists drawing attention to this matter, and enclosing affidavits and letters in proof of the facts alleged; and whether it is the case that Mr. Stockwell continues to carry on the business of a newspaper reporter during official hours, notwithstanding that attention has thus been called to this breach of the regulations; and, if so, whether he proposes to take any steps to ensure the observance of the regulations?
(3.50.)  DR. CLARK  (Caithness) : We have been told by the Chief Secretary for Ireland that the Scotch crofters were not rack-rented like the Irish peasants. We have now received a Return of the work of the Crofters' Commission for the last four years, and I find that they have decided 9,340 cases, and have reduced the rents from £50,276 to £35,214, or about one-third. This, I think, conclusively proves that the crofters have been very much rack-rented. During the same period the Commissioners have reduced the amount of arrears from £112,000 to £74,000. There are provisions in the Crofters' Act which empower the Commissioners to increase the holdings; but those provisions appear to have been practically useless, seeing that only in 14 cases have increased holdings been given, and in the principal case the Duke of Sutherland, who was the landlord, was a consenting party. In one instance, the Duke of Sutherland was himself a claimant, and he is now paying rental for the increased holding as a crofter. It is manifest, therefore, that the provisions in the Act in regard to increased holdings, as we told the House when the Bill was under discussion, are worthless. I intend to move the reduction of the Vote on two grounds—first, that the rents fixed are too high; and, secondly, that where the Commissioners do fix a fair rent and reduce the arrears, they still leave too heavy a burden for these unfortunate

 MR. P. STANHOPE  (Wednesbury) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he will procure from the Railway Companies, and present to Parliament, a Return showing the number of free passes, whether permanent or occasional, issued by each Railway Company upon the whole or any portion of its system?
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing) : I understand that the French Squadron will visit Portsmouth on their return from Cronstadt about the date named. This visit is spontaneous on the part of the French Fleet, and is no doubt prompted by the pleasant recollection of the recent interchange of visits in the Mediterranean between the French and English Fleets stationed there. Arrangements will therefore be made on a commensurate scale to mark the exchange of international civilities, the opportunity for which the proposed visit will afford.
 *MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : I would ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider what are the real feelings of the Irish people, and he will find that so long as this large number of  employés régime
*(12.7.)  MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : Desiring to make some observations regarding the anomalous character of the Irish Constabulary—regarding its numbers, its cost, and its constitution—I beg to move a reduction of £500 in the Vote. The House may, perhaps, be weary of the subject, it having been so often and so fully, upon previous occasions, treated by able speakers upon each recurring presentation of the Irish Estimates.
 622 623 624 625 "The candidate must be unmarried, and between the ages of 21 and 26 years. If a candidate can show specially qualifying service as an officer in the Army, Navy, or in a Police Force, he may be admitted up to the age of 28." "The sons of Constabulary officers whose names are on the Inspector General's list of candidates are permitted to enter at the age of 19." 626 "The candidate who is placed first by the Civil Service Commissioners will, on his nomination being confirmed by the Lord Lieutenant, be ordered to the Depot. But, previously to his entering on his course of instruction there, some person on his behalf must become answerable to the Commandant of the Depot, that such cadet, in addition to his regulated pay, shall receive a sum at the rate of £50 per annum until his appointment to the office of District Inspector." "But cadets, being only in a state of probation, will not be considered as permanently attached to the Force, until they attain the rank of District Inspector, and they are to clearly understand that if, in the interim, His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant should be pleased to dispense with their services, in consequence either of unfavourable reports received of their conduct or proficiency while at the Depot, or of their character and position previous to their joining it, they are not to expect or require any reason to be assigned for their removal from the establishment, on which account it will not be obligatory on a cadet to purchase uniform, or to incur any other expense, consequent on his belonging to the Force." Civil Service Handbook "Candidates are selected by competitive examinations conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners from among candidates nominated by the Lord Lieutenant through the Chief Secretary for Ireland, and the Inspector General of the Royal Irish Constabulary … and the Inspector General's nominations, are confined to candidates already connected with the Force, such as the sons of Royal Irish Constabulary officers, and these candidates compete among themselves for cadetships specially set apart for them." 627 "As due regard is paid by the authorities to the claims of each candidate, and priority given to those cases which seem to deserve it, it is impossible to forecast for what particular examination a candidate may he nominated; and between the actual nomination and the competition only six weeks, as a rule, can intervene. The nomination holds good for one examination only, and gives no claim whatever to admission to any future examination." "These rates are exclusive of the valuable allowances attached to each class. But officers of ability need not confine their hopes to this scale; they are eligible for the lucrative Staff appointments at Head-quarters, Resident Ma gistracies, &c.…. In addition to the social status of the Royal Irish Constabulary, officers being in every way most desirable, their duties are light, their pay respectable, and the prospect of promotion to the highest permanent official posts in Ireland lies before the officers who have shown ability. … The majority of the candidates successful last year were graduates in Honours of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin." imperium in imperio 628 629 "A man must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a very agreeable fellow. It is the greatest absurdity; it is actually snowing at this moment. The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home when they can." dicta "The majesty of the law must, at all hazards, be upheld. He had no doubt that either the policeman or the witness for the defendant had committed gross perjury. Judge Gibson had stated in a recent case that a policeman's evidence is more reliable than the evidence of a civilian, and he quite agreed with Judge Gibson." 630 631
(4.32.)  MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I have no complaint whatever to make as to the tone in which the right hon. Gentleman has approached this question. He has manifested his usual discretion in refusing to enter upon the discussion of the general policy which has been pursued in the Highlands. The Lord Advocate has, however, admitted the necessity for better provision for an enlargement of holdings. But the right hon. Gentleman did not say that the Government propose to remove the obstacles which exist under the Act to those holdings being enlarged. On the contrary; the Government refuse to have anything to do with it, and instead offer £150,000 to deport the people to America. The enlargements which have been referred to by the right hon. Gentleman as having taken place recently were not due entirely to the Act, many of them having been made in pursuance of a promise given as far back as 1885. But, even when granted, what did they amount to? It is true they benefit 112 individuals, but they only afford grazing for 2½ sheep. The great and burning question in the Highlands is not reduction of rents, but more land. That means that the crofters shall be restored to the lands they occupied 90 years ago. It is said there is no land in Scotland to give the crofters; but if that is so, would such experienced men as the Crofters' Commissioners have recommended that more land should be given to them? The Commission has taken evidence in the Highlands, which forms the best, truest, and finest history of the Highlands that ever was written, because it is a history furnished by the Highlanders themselves. The great and burning question is that of the moorland. When the right hon. Gentleman says there is no more land or moorland to be given, he went in the face of the Report of the Commission, which laid down certain rules under which land could be obtained. The Commissioners are men of great experience, and it is an insult to their intelligence to say that they have advised Her Majesty in favour of

 MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education if he is aware of the large deficiency of accommodation in the elementary schools of Colchester; and if he has taken any steps to secure the additional supply of school places in that borough which has been rendered necessary by the considerable increase of population?
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : The Constabulary authorities report that the constable was on duty. He denies that he refused to allow the persons named to enter the premises, or that he used the language attributed to him.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Commissioners of National Education have reported that the lesson books in the National schools are undergoing a thorough revision. The new edition of the fourth book is not yet printed off, but most of the proof sheets have been received from the printer, and there will be no unnecessary delay in issuing the work.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I answered this question on Friday. There is only one work left unfinished.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The facts are substantially as stated in the first paragraph of the question. Complaints on the subject have been made by the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners' Association. The Irish Government have taken every precaution to prevent a recurrence of the disease in the few districts in Ireland in which there have been cases, and they do not think that it would be advisable or to the permanent interest of the Irish cattle trade to at the present moment modify the restriction in the Dublin district referred to.
(6.25.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : I will leave it to my right hon. Friend the Attorney General to reply to criticisms on items, but there are one or two points on which I should like to say a word or two. I will not enter into the causes of what all agree to be the present improved condition of Ireland, and will deal only with the general complaint that the Estimates do not appear to keep pace with the improvement. There is, I think, some misconception in the minds of hon. Gentlemen as to the character of the expenditure in the Law Department. It seems to be thought that a large part of the money is spent in prosecutions undertaken under the Crimes Act, and it is therefore asked why the Estimate is not reduced. The explanation is that the great bulk of the expenditure is not in connection with the Crimes Act at all. Even when it is in most active operation, and when the number of prosecutions is at the maximum, the proportion of cases to the number under the ordinary law is relatively small. The number of prosecutions under the Crimes Act certainly
 580
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I agree in the major proposition of the hon. Member, but do not admit his application of it. I do not admit that to try a rioter in a summary manner before two Magistrates is a suspension of the rights of free-born citizens that anyone can complain of. Indeed, it is on representations from hon. Gentlemen below the Gangway that Sub-section 2 of the Crimes Act is made of perpetual and universal application. It is thought that assaults on the police are a class of offences which ought to be dealt with summarily. With regard to other questions arising on the Vote, my right hon. and learned Friend who has charge of it will be able to answer them.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : With regard to the combination of the judicial and executive functions of a Resident Magistrate at the same time and place, I quite feel that, as far as possible, the different functions should be kept separate, and I have done my best to carry this out. Such cases have happened, and it would be too much to say they will never happen again unless two Magistrates are appointed in every district in Ireland—one to exercise judicial and another to exercise executive functions.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : In 1882–3 the number reached 85, and certainly it has never been augmented during the time I have been Chief Secretary. I do not say it will be impossible to reduce the number below 72, but I do not think that any cause has been shown for doing so, and I doubt whether it would be expedient. Of course, hon. Gentlemen, naturally enough, look upon Resident Magistrates in the light of particular
 608
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I do not think a hard and fast rule could be laid down in regard to that matter. I think that a Resident Magistrate should mainly discharge his functions in his own district, but I do not think it would be a wise proceeding on the part of any Government to say that these paid Magistrates should not go into adjoining districts to try cases, no matter what was going on. I think all must feel that that would be a limitation of the powers of the Executive not at all calculated to advance the cause of the proper administration of justice, and one to which those responsible for the government of the country could hardly be expected to assent.
(10.9.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I will myself deal with the earlier part of the speech of the hon. and learned Gentleman who has just sat down, leaving it to my right hon. and learned Friend to deal with that part which relates to the Revising Barristers. In the earlier part of his speech the hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the question of Resident Magistrates, their number, and the policy of having Resident Magistrates at all. On that point I must remind the Committee that these Magistrates were originally appointed as a great benefit to the community. That was, I think, in 1836. Their number was increased very rapidly until 1855, when the population had not reached the total reduction to which it afterwards fell, but had suffered one of the severest reductions recorded. At that period the number of Resident Magistrates was fixed at 72, and from that time it has never sunk below that level. In 1870, in relation to certain circumstances, a few additional Resident Magistrates were appointed. The Government have, however, for some time past been engaged in reducing the number by the process of not filling up vacancies when they occur, and now, since the present estimate was prepared, the number for the first time for many years past has again sunk to the normal level at which it stood during the 30 or 40 years which preceded the agitation of 1879–80.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I hope the holders of licences will not stand in the way of the good government of the country in the future; but I cannot say
 609
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Oh, no.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have no ground for thinking that there will be a discontinuance of the services of the gentlemen employed upon fair rent cases; there will, no doubt, be still a large number of cases to dispose of, and the sooner they are disposed of the better.
(9.40.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Of the various points raised, I take first that referred to by the hon. and learned Member for North Longford. It is perfectly true that the collection of statistics as a whole and on all subjects is rightly left to the Registrar General's Department. But in order to carry out the Bill of 1887 a system was started of collecting on the spot agricultural statistics based upon actual transactions. It will, I think, be admitted that for information so important for Ireland newspaper reports cannot be relied upon. Indeed, that is not done by any Agricultural Department either in England, France, Germany, or Italy. The hon. Member has asked some questions respecting the conduct of Mr. Wrench in the purchase of property that he initiated as the agent of Sir Victor Brooke. It is alleged that Mr. Wrench took a practical interest in the matter, even after he had been made a Land Commissioner. I am informed that, though it is true that Mr. Wrench was consulted by Mr. MacCarthy, the Land Purchase Commissioner responsible for sanctioning the sale, it is not accurate to say that he took any part in the transaction other than answering the questions put to him by Mr. MacCarthy. The hon. Member appears to think that the Government acted partially or rashly in appointing Mr. Wrench a member of the Congested Districts Board for agricultural purposes, but I am somewhat surprised at the criticism after the suggestion thrown
 603
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! There is no Debate to adjourn. The hon. Member can proceed with his Amendments as he decides to proceed without an application for a grant.
 MR. SPEAKER : The Amendment is in order.
 *MR. SPEAKER : I decline to put the Motion of the hon. Gentleman.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 *MR. SPEAKER : The Second Reading is not proposed now.
 *MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : This seems to me to be a very hard case, and I do not see what harm there can be in allowing this poor man to renew his claim before the Committee that is about to be appointed.
*(5.29.)  MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : I have to complain that an inquiry into prison administration in Scotland, similar to that which has been granted in the case of England, has been refused.
 *MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH : I am satisfied with the statement of the right hon. Gentleman.
*(4.15.)  MR. FRASER-MACKINTOSH  (Inverness-shire) : By the operation of the Commission considerable reductions of rent have taken place for the benefit of the crofters; but I regret that the Government—though the matter was impressed upon them on more than one occasion—have not seen fit to deal with the question of the extension of holdings by enlarging in this direction the powers of the Crofters Act. It is no secret that the present Crofters' Commission is hampered in every way by their inability to deal comprehensively with the question of the enlargement of the holdings, and until this matter is so taken up, the Highland question will never be satisfactorily solved.
*(5.32.)  MR. C. S. PARKER  (Perth) : I am sorry to find myself obliged to call attention to a case in which there is still continued an act of injustice on a member of a very humble and deserving class of public officers. I refer to the warders and gaol officers in the General Prison at Perth. All I ask is that faith should be kept with public officers, however humble. Under a Treasury Minute it is permissible to grant free quarters in a prison. In the case of Perth there is an abundance of free quarters available, and it has been the practice for a very long time past to give free quarters to the warders there. It, however, occurred to the Treasury, in a moment of that parsimony which is often mistaken for economy, that they might effect a saving
 574
 *MR. C. S. PARKER : I may add that the Prison Commissioners had every right to bind the Government to the terms they promised. They represented the Government in dealing with the officers of the prison, and they acted strictly within the authority given to them by the Treasury Minute. I really hope the Lord Advocate will consider whether the new Committee might not give an independent opinion on the rights of this man. I shall be quite ready to accept their decision.
 *MR. C. S. PARKER : Then I move the reduction of the Vote by £200. I believe the warder's income was reduced by 10 per cent., and £200 will represent a similar reduction of the Commissioners' pay.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I may say that it is the intention of the Government to present a Return which will give the information which the hon. Member is desirous of obtaining.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : I quite realise the importance of Sanitary Authorities and other Bodies concerned with the public health affording every facility for an inspection of the sanitary works in their districts by the foreign delegates attending the International Congress of Hygiene, and I am quite sure that the authorities and their officers will be glad to render any assistance they can in the matter.
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University) : The hon. Member is, I think, under a misapprehension. The minimum rate of wages for painters under the Government contract with Messrs. Holland & Hannen was 7½d. per hour, not 8½d., as the hon. Member seems to suppose. If, therefore, any painters are employed at 7½d. per hour at the British Museum, that would not be contrary to the terms of the contract, or contrary, as we believe, to the prevailing rates of wages in the trade.
*(7.0.)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : Several questions have been brought under notice to which I will endeavour to reply. In the first place, the hon. Member for Cork has complained of the action of the Crown Solicitor in the case of Captain Rye, the Solicitor having allowed a juror to go into the box who had written a letter prejudging the case. It appears, however, that the letter was written in favour of the prisoner, and that after hearing the evidence the juror who wrote it concurred in a verdict of guilty. It cannot, therefore, be said there was any miscarriage of justice. The fact of the letter having been written was wholly unknown to the Crown Solicitor; of course, if it had been known to him, it would have been improper to allow the writer of it to serve on the jury. Then, in regard to the complaint that a constable in the civil action which has been referred to took the case to the Court of Queen's Bench and succeeded in having the verdict against him set aside on a point of law, surely hon. Gentlemen opposite do not suggest that it is the duty of a constable to submit to a verdict which is erroneous in point of law? With regard to the action which arose out of the alleged firing by the police, the complaint seems to be that the defence was rested upon a purely technical point. But, as a matter of fact, the defence was that the injuries
 585
 *MR. MADDEN : It is true that certain costs of private prosecutors in England are paid out of public moneys, but what is so paid does not cover all the expenses of the prosecution. In Ireland we have a system of local Crown Solicitors which does not exist in England. Before the Committee of 1888 Mr. Justice Wills expressed strong approval of this system and in favour of it being extended to England. In the opinion of that eminent Judge we get good value for the expenditure in Ireland, and, as I have shown the Committee, we are making effort to reduce that expenditure.
 *MR. MADDEN : If the hon. Member will put a notice on the Paper I shall be happy to consider the matter.
*(7.41.)  MR. MADDEN : I think it right to point out to the hon. Member that there was, in my opinion, no evidence before me that Mr. Magan had obtained money dishonestly; and, therefore, it is hardly right to say that "I contented myself with a civil prosecution." The money was obtained by Mr. Magan under a mistaken view of his rights, but I decline to assent to the view that he obtained it dishonestly. If I had thought so, I should have ordered a criminal
 589
 *MR. MADDEN : I shall have no objection to laying that correspondance on the Table if the hon. Member will move it.
 *MR. MADDEN : Yes.
*(9.16.)  MR. MADDEN : I think the hon. and learned Gentleman will recognise that it would be impossible for the Government to make any such application of the one-fifth constituting the guarantee deposit as he has suggested; but if I were to go into the question I would be out of order. I pass on, therefore, to the question of the relative position of the Land Purchase Commissioners and the Fair Rent Commissioners. The policy of the Government is embodied in the Land Department Bill, and is not only to amalgamate the two Departments of the Land Commission, but to unite into one great Land Department
 599
 *MR. MADDEN : I do not in the least attempt to minimise the value of the information collected by the Registrar General, but the hon. and learned Gentleman is aware that the Registrar General has not the machinery at his disposal for the collection of these particular statistics; he has not the means to send men to attend the various farms, and ascertain the prices of the produce sold.
*(7.51.)  MR. MADDEN : With regard to the first point to which the hon. Member has called attention—the estimated sum for election petitions—I would point out that there is a similar Estimate to this taken for both England and Scotland. It is only a necessary provision made under Statute for the event of there being an election petition. If there were no such petition in the year the money would not be used but would be returned into the Exchequer. As to the second matter the hon. Gentleman has referred to, I think the present Government have given more evidence than any of their predecessors of their appreciation of the importance of localising bankruptcy business in Ireland. The first local Bankruptcy Act was passed by the present Government, and I quite agree with the hon. Member that it is desirable that the

(8.3.)  MR. MADDEN : It is the desire of the Government to proceed next Session with the provisions embodied in the Land Department Bill, which will, in their opinion, conduce both to efficiency and economy in the working of the sale and transfer and valuation of land. The Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Bill has been withdrawn, but I hope to re-introduce it next year. As regards the Local Registration of Titles
 593
 *MR. MADDEN : In regard to the Bankruptcy Bill, I may say I do not believe that the Amendments I have placed on the Paper are inconsistent with the general principles of the measure. I cannot, however, on the present occasion go into a detailed discussion of the merits of my Amendments.
 *MR. MADDEN : The charges for election petitions are made in accordance with the system which prevails in Ireland, and I do not think the amount is in any way extravagant.
 MR. MADDEN : I cannot see how in this, a matter between private litigants, it is possible for the Government or the Department to interfere, even if we had facts before us to justify the assumption that the result of the appeal in the one case would govern the 239 other cases.
 MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.B.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to several recent cases in Lanarkshire, in which Section 13 of "The Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1887," empowering the men to appoint their own checkweigher, has been evaded by the refusal of owners to accept the man chosen by the workmen, though of good character, and by their threatening to close the pits if his election was adhered to; whether he is aware that it has been held by the Court of Session that such action on the part of owners is not a contravention of the Act or otherwise illegal; and whether he will re-consider his refusal to receive a deputation of two miners, to explain the circumstances of these cases, with a view to an amendment of the law?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : May I ask the Secretary of State for War whether he is prepared to make any further statement with regard to the proposed allowance to the Crimean veterans; and whether it will be necessary to make any application to the House, by way of Supplementary Estimate or otherwise?
 MR. E. STANHOPE : It is not necessary to take any action in the House on the subject. The proposal will only deal with a limited number of cases, and it will be desirable that any very strong cases should be sent to the War Office for consideration. I have it in contemplation to call on the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital to act as umpires in the matter, in preference to deciding on the cases myself.
 *MR. E. STANHOPE : If the Warrant be approved by Her Majesty, it will, I expect, be issued early next month.
 *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle) : Messrs. Kynoch &Co. do hold Government contracts, and I am informed by the Director of Contracts that they are pledged to pay the current rate of wages in connection therewith.
 MR. DE LISLE  (Leicestershire, Mid.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the recommendations of the Royal Academy Commission Report, 1863, have been generally carried out; whether especially the recommendation (page ix.)
 "That to the 50 professional academicians there should he added 10 members not being artists, subject to the confirmation of the Crown," "That the Government will provide a suitable and proper building or accommodation for the preservation and exhibition of the Bequest pictures as the property of the Nation "
 LORD H. BRUCE  (Wilts, Chippenham) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade why no attempt was made, previous to the year 1888, by the Board of Trade to enforce the Alien Act in the Ports of London and Hull; why no attempt was made, previous to the year 1890, to enforce the Act in other ports of the United Kingdom; whether the public statement is correct that there are now upwards of 400 aliens, with every apparent prospect of the number increasing, arriving weekly in the Port of London alone, 90 per cent. of whom appear to be in a perfectly destitute condition; and whether the Government intend to take any stringent and effectual measures to prevent this intro mission of indigent foreigners amongst the most emaciated of our poor?
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I need hardly remind the hon. Member that the Royal
 553
 MR. GOSCHEN : The latter question is a question for the shareholders. They have to decide whether they will elect or will not elect a member of the Government. They are the judges of the importance or otherwise of his presence on the Board. With regard to time, the hon. Member will bear in mind that the office hours of members of the Government are not mapped out in the same way as those of Civil servants, although, in the long run, they may work almost as many hours. I never heard of any member of the Government, either of this or of past Administrations, allowing any work of the kind to interfere with the discharge of official duties. In many cases, members of the Government have private estates to manage, and other calls upon their time. Indeed, I know of no persons who have more calls upon their time.
 MR. GOSCHEN : There is no official prohibition against members of the Government, who are also Members of the House, being directors of public companies, and I may add that while there is no prohibition there is also no precedent against it. I may also say that I think that members of successive Administrations have held such appointments. I am quite sure, however, that
 557
 MR. GOSCHEN : That case fits precisely the view I have taken. It would clearly be inadmissible for an Under Secretary of State to be concerned in any institution such as that to which the hon. Member refers.
 MR. GOSCHEN : No, Sir.
 MR. GOSCHEN : If the hon. Member thinks that the course he proposes will facilitate business, and that we may get the postponed Vote within a reasonable time to-morrow, I will consent to report Progress.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : May I point out that the 10 per cent. goes to the benefit of the ratepayers, and not to the benefit of the Government?
 MR. GOSCHEN : The Bill is one which is asked for by Scotland, and I

 CAPTAIN GRICE-HUTCHINSON  (Aston Manor) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the firm of Kynoch & Co. (Limited), Aston, have

 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether he is aware that a strong feeling exists in many parts of the country that it is undesirable that Inspectors of schools should take part in political meetings or entertainments in the districts in which they inspect the schools; and whether the Education Department will, upon such a case being brought under their notice, inform the Inspector that he ought not to attend political meetings in his district?
 MR. COBB : Does the Order refer to meetings when an election is imminent, or to political meetings generally?
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that though they are private prosecutions the costs are defrayed from the public funds?
(6.50.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : We have recently had some controversy in this House with reference to the contribution of Ireland to the Imperial Exchequer; but there was one point on which I can agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Belfast, namely, that the cost of Ireland is greater than that of any other part of the Empire, and that the specially extravagant part of that cost is mainly under this and other Votes. I know the time of the Chief Secretary has been greatly occupied this Session; but if the right hon. Gentleman can find time—I know he has the skill—he ought to devote himself to the cleansing of this Augean stable, which is a public scandal. It costs twice as much money to convict a man for stealing ducks in Ireland as it does in England. The average cost of prosecutions in England is £9; in Ireland it is over £20. I have one question to ask with reference to the remuneration of the Attorney General for Ireland. Hitherto we had in the Estimates opposite to the £5,000 for the Attorney General for Ireland these words:—" This is personal to the holder of the present office." Why are those words now omitted? I would be the last man to challenge the merits of the Attorney General for Ireland, but this is not a permanent fixing of the salary of the right hon. Gentleman. The Lord Advocate gets only £2,500. What I want is that we should retain on the face of the Estimates an intimation that the Government has not made a final arrangement charging £5,000 on the Estimates for an Attorney General for Ireland. In asking that question I do not wish in any way to say anything disrespectful of the
 584
 MR. LABOUCHERE : How is it possible for a member of the Government to attend Board meetings, which probably take place once a week, and also attend to the business of his Department, and how, in these circumstances, can he possibly protect the money of the shareholders?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of the case of Sir Henry Austen Layard, who was a director of the Ottoman Bank, but who withdrew from the directorship when appointed Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs?
 MR. LABOUCHERE : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether there is any official prohibition of Members of the Government, who are also Members of this House, being directors of public companies during their tenures of office; and whether, if not, he will lay upon the Table of the House the names of the Members of the Government who are directors of public companies, together with the names of the companies?
 MR. LABOUCHERE  (Northampton) : I beg also to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether a Departmental Committee has been sitting upon the question of the sums retained from the salaries of officers of Convict and Local Prisons for their quarters within the prisons; and whether, if so, the Committee is likely soon to make its Report?
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : It is not usual to publish the conclusions of a Departmental Committee, but only the decisions which may be arrived at after full consideration, and, if necessary, after consultation with the Treasury. The Report has only reached my hands this morning. I have not, therefore, been able to give it the attention which it will require.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am aware of the facts stated in the first two paragraphs, and have had the circumstances of the case under the careful consideration of the Inspectors and of myself. It did not appear to me likely that any further explanation of the circumstances could be given by a deputation of the miners. If the hon. Member thinks otherwise, I will not object to receive a deputation of two of them.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am not aware that Mr. Stockwell has been engaged as a newspaper reporter during official hours. On the contrary, I am assured by that gentleman that he has not carried on such business during official hours, and does not do so now. A representation such as the hon. Member describes has, I am aware, been forwarded to the Treasury by the Institute of Journalists, though I am not aware what claim these gentlemen have to address the Treasury on the subject.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : I shall be happy to consider the question of extending the second delivery of letters if the hon. Baronet will let me know to
 559
*(12.59.)  MR. H. J. WILSON : We were promised some information with regard to this Vote.
(1.8.)  MR. CALDWELL : On Clause 2 I have to move an Amendment with the object of creating special harbour districts, the representatives of which shall have the management and maintenance of special harbour or local works.
 MR. CALDWELL : The Amendment has a substantive operation apart from the question of taxation.
(1.25)  MR. CALDWELL : I have now to move an Amendment to the

(1.40.)  MR. CALDWELL : I beg to move the omission of the words "from the persons locally interested, and at the expense of such persons."
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I beg to move that the Debate be adjourned. I think the hour is too late for us to be justified in attempting to consider the provisions of this important Bill, and the Amendments of which notice has been given. We are not justified in passing legislation of this kind without giving it due consideration.
(11.49.)  MR. CALDWELL : Whilst London and Dublin get a large subvention out of Imperial Funds for their police, the whole of Scotland only receives £155,000. Besides the grant for the Dublin police of £100,000, there is a charge of £1,380,000 for the Royal Irish Constabulary. We recognise that the Scotch force is a citizen force, and that therefore they can do with a small subvention. In Ireland circumstances are entirely different. The police there are managed by the Imperial Government, and necessarily the cost of the force is placed upon Imperial funds. But I think when there is a prospect of the introduction of a Local Government Bill for Ireland it is right to express a hope that the police of Ireland will be placed on the same footing as the police in Scotland and in England. [ Interruption
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I think this is not a matter which ought to be decided altogether of strict legal right. This man was a warder in Barlinnie Prison, where he had free quarters, and he accepted his appointment in Perth on the footing of getting free quarters there. After he had enjoyed free quarters in Perth for two years he was deprived of them, and thus had to forfeit a considerable portion of his emoluments. Would anyone in an ordinary business transaction take the course the Government has taken? I do not think anyone would.
(1.46.)  MR. CALDWELL : I now rise to move my last Amendment. Its
 637
 MR. CALDWELL : I beg to move that the Debate be now adjourned. The Report stage of the Bill has been taken when many Scotch Members were away, and I think an opportunity should be afforded of considering the Bill in all its bearings before the Third Reading is taken.
 MR. FLYNN : The right hon. Gentleman says that if there was fraud then the tenants must have been parties to the conspiracy, but remember that all the profit of the transaction would go into the pockets of Mr. Magan; the tenants would get no benefit. With regard to the case of Captain Rye, I can only say it exhibits a most extraordinary state of ignorance of mind on the part of the Crown Solicitor if he was unaware of this letter which has been alluded to. When jurors of a popular complexion in religion and politics are ordered in large numbers to stand by, the amount of knowledge of the jurors' opinions displayed by the Crown Solicitor is very remarkable. Whether John Murphy or Patrick Ryan is a Catholic or Protestant, a moderate or extreme Home Ruler, seems to be known to the Crown Solicitor, and yet the same gentleman is absolutely ignorant of a public letter of Mr. Collins, prejudging a case in which he is called upon to act as juror. He concurred in the verdict no doubt, and I do not maintain that Mr. Collins did not do his duty. My complaint is that in such circumstances this juror should be allowed to act in a case when so many respectable men are directed to stand by. I must not be understood as saying that the sentence upon Captain Rye was too lenient. As marking the manner in which this case has been met by the right hon. Gentleman, I move the reduction of the Vote by £1,000.
(7.44.)  MR. FLYNN : There are a few matters here to which I desire to draw the attention of the Attorney General. I want an explanation of what seem curious items under Sub-head "a"—£25 for the master of the Queen's Bench, and £50 to his clerk in connection with Election Petitions, and also £1,700 for writing clerks for the same purpose. Seeing that there have been no Election Petitions in Ireland since that in which my hon. Friend the Member for Derry was successful against his opponent some years ago, I want to know what these charges are for. Then, I find that in connection with salaries in the Court of Bankruptcy in Ireland a sum of £10,074 is charged, which is an increase on the sum allocated last year. I want to ask if the Government could not see their way to bringing about a substantial reduction in the amount of this Vote by devolving a considerable portion of the bankruptcy business upon the local Bankruptcy Courts recently established. These local courts have been established in Belfast and Cork, and have given great satisfaction. I speak from a knowledge of the Court in Cork. Applications have been made to the right hon. Gentleman to extend the sphere of the jurisdiction of that court to Kerry and another adjoining county. Before the establishment of these Courts bankruptcy business in Ireland had grown to be a scandal, an enormous

 MR. FLYNN : I hope the Chief Secretary will give an answer to the question nut to him as to the combination of the executive and judicial functions in one Resident Magistrate in one and the same place.
(10.34.)  MR. FLYNN : It has been well said you may prove anything with statistics, but it is difficult for the right hon. Gentleman to prove from this Vote the success of his administration in Ireland, because we find that notwithstanding the repeal of the Coercion Act, and the return to law and order, there is still an increase on the Vote of nearly £2,000. The right hon. Gentleman in his touching peroration said that the Irish people would look back with admiration on the manner in which these Magistrates had performed their duty, and he also remarked that perhaps our dislike of the system of Resident Magistrates proceeded more from distrust and dislike of the law than of the men employed in this exceptional work. Well, the law is odious, and it has been made still more odious by the manner of its administration.

(8.8.)  MR. FLYNN : I desire to call attention to certain points in connection with this Vote. In the first place, I desire to know on what principle the land valuers are appointed, as much dissatisfaction has been expressed as to the system on which they are chosen. It is a practical axiom that that law is best which is best administered, and the Land Law in Ireland would be a great boon and blessing to the Irish tenants if it were properly administered. But we say with regard both to the Land Commissioners and the land valuers that much of the benefit that would otherwise accrue to the tenants is lost owing to the way in which these appointments are made, and that the tenants have still to complain of unjust and unfair rents owing to the improper appointments that are made, especially in regard to the case of the land valuers. Of coarse, the reply I shall receive will be that the system gives dissatisfaction, because it is impossible that any valuer can satisfy both landlord and tenant. But what we complain of is that the valuers generally belong to a class who are more or less associated with the

 MR. FLYNN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that on the occasion of a public meeting announced to be held in the Commercial Club, Fermoy, County Cork, on 22nd instant, to hear an address from Mr. Michael Condon, of Lancaster, on the present political situation, a policeman, Sergeant Kelly, stood at the entrance door of the club and refused to allow Mr. Condon and Mr. Thomas Barry, P.L.G., to pass into the premises; and, on being asked by Mr. Barry on what authority he was so acting, this policeman replied that he would not answer a "pig head like him"; whether the Constabulary Authorities can state upon whose authority the Committee acted upon this occasion; and upon what grounds did he prevent the entrance of the gentleman named to the premises of the Commercial Club?
 MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether complaints have reached him as to the ill-treatment of British subjects who have recently emigrated to Brazil; and whether it is a fact that emigration agents in Great Britain and in Ireland have tempted persons to emigrate to Brazil by offers of "free passages" and "free farms" on reaching that country, but that, on arrival,

 MR. FLYNN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether, owing to the number of complaints made in reference to the reading books in the National schools of Ireland, the Commissioners of National Education have undertaken a revision of these books; and is a new edition of the fourth book printed; and, if so, what is the cause of the delay in issuing the new book?
(1.5.)  THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : I hope my hon. Friend will not press his objection.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The Government object to putting a burden of this kind on the rates.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I retain the opinion I intimated in Committee, that the money should be made available under the general obligation to meet any deficiencies.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : If the object of the Amendment is to secure the competence of the County Council to appoint a sub-committee for the purpose of managing the works, that is already secured, and without any provision in this Bill at all, because under the Local Government Act the County Council have absolute power to do so. If the hon. Gentleman means to go over the old question of rating, that has been already decided, and I should be abusing the Forms of the House if I used this Amendment as an opportunity of discussing it.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The whole pith of the hon. Gentleman's proposal originally was to restrict the rating to the district primarily interested. That Motion is now thrown overboard, and the result of this Amendment will be that, whereas the county is to bear a rate of a penny in the £1 for the maintenance of harbours, their administration is to be put in the hands of a small district. That is a preposterous proposition.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : May I ask whether the Amendment is in order, having regard to the fact that it is merely part of a composite Amendment, part of which will impose a burden upon the people, which, as I understand, can only be done in Committee.
(5.50.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : There must be an end to matters of this kind. This man's case has been investigated, and I am sorry to say I cannot assent to the hon. Member's proposal.
(5.41.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : This is a purely individual case, and no question of principle whatever is involved. It has been carefully investigated by a strong Committee, and I do not think any other decision could have been arrived at. The hon. Member for Perth, who has shown the greatest perseverance in dealing with this matter, contends that if a man has for any time had given to him free quarters there is an obligation
 575
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : Perhaps the hon. Member will allow me to interpose. Since the refusal in question the matter has been carefully considered, and it may be satisfactory to the hon. Gentleman that I should at once inform him that it has been decided to appoint a small Committee to inquire into the wages, hours, &c, of prison staffs in Scotland, and to take evidence during the autumn.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : The hon. Member for Caithness will allow me to to point out that, while valuers are of great importance in the work of the Commission, their decisions are not final. They are men who are at the disposal of the Commissioners, and there is a power of appeal from their decisions. It is the right of anyone interested in these matters, in cases where there is any doubt about the opinion of the valuers, to take the matter before the Commissioners, who are ultimately responsible.
(4.19.)  THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : The Vote no doubt raises large possibilities of discussion, but I shall not be expected to deal exhaustively with all the questions that have been touched upon. During the year 1890 there were orders for the enlargement of the holdings of 112 applicants, but, as the applications were heard in batches and the orders were collective, I cannot say what was the
 565 status quo 566
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : This proposal has been placed in the Bill to save the localities the expense of applying for Provisional Orders. The harbours are being constructed with Government money, and the provision is that the Board of Trade shall interpose in cases where the rates levied exceed the interest at the rate of 10 per cent. There is nothing to prevent the Local Authority reducing the rates without the intervention of the Board of Trade.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I beg to move that the Bill be now read the third time.
 MR. J. PARKER SMITH : I beg to support the Amendment. The effect of the Bill will be that the country at large will make a profit out of individual piers which are intended for the benefit of fishermen.
(2.15.)  MR. J. PARKER SMITH : In a few words, I wish to say what I think are the drawbacks and disadvantages of the Bill. I am afraid that the Bill will not meet the particular case it is intended to meet, namely, the case of small places, the people of which are not able to help themselves. The Commissioners recommended that facilities should be given to small and poor communities to erect boat slips and the like, by the sending down of foremen and supplying cement and other material. I doubt whether the Bill will operate in the very cases where it is most required. It will no doubt meet the case of people who have made themselves unpleasant, and who have broken the law, like the people of the Lews. I regret that the Government have not seen their way to accept suggestions which would, I believe, have done something to avoid such a state of things. The Bill will do good, but it might have been amended so as to do a great deal more good.
 MR. J. PARKER SMITH  (Lanark, Partick) : I have to move an Amendment to Clause 2, to provide that the amount of free labour, or labour at a reduced wage, promised by the inhabitants shall be ascertained by the County Council before resolving to proceed with an application for a grant.
(2.35.)  MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name. The words "Council Chamber" appeared in the Bill of last year, but were struck out on my initiative. In view of the fact that we are now on the eve of an election, I do not think it wise that the present County Council should be given power to spend a large sum of money in a new Council Chamber.
(11.47.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : We would be very glad to accept
 620
 MR. NOLAN  (Louth, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is
 555
 MR. J. POWELL WILLIAMS  (Birmingham, S.) : Will the Rating of Machinery (No. 2) Bill be taken after 1 o'clock?
 MR. HAYDEN  (Leitrim, S.) : I wish to call attention to the retention in the Commission of the Peace of Mr. Magan, who has been convicted of defrauding to a considerable amount in Wexford. The person to whom I refer induced the tenant to part with his interest in the holding, and by misstating the arrears he succeeded in getting £46 out of the Commissioners, which sum, I believe, Mr. Concannon was compelled to return. I do not desire to press for a vindictive prosecution against this man; but I do say it is disgraceful that he should be allowed to administer justice.
 *MR. HAYDEN : I wish to have copies of the letters which passed between the Land Commission and myself, the Attorney General and myself, and the Attorney General and the Land Commission and Mr. Magan.
(7.14.)  MR. HAYDEN : It is impossible for anyone who examines the transactions in relation to Mr. Magan's action to come to any other conclusion than that it was deliberate fraud, and not
 586
(7.36.)  MR. HAYDEN : Would the right hon. Gentleman have any objection to laying on the Table the correspondence in the case of Mr. Percy Magan?
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : I am not at present prepared to ask the Railway Companies for such a Return as is indicated in the question, as the hon. Member has not shown me what useful purpose it would be likely to serve.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W.) : The enforcement of the Alien Acts rests with the Home Secretary and not with the Board of Trade, but the question of their enforcement prior to 1888 was fully gone into by a Committee of this House which sat in 1888–89, and I would refer the noble Lord to the proceedings of that Committee for the information he desires. Since 1890 the Act has been put into operation (at the request of the Board of Trade) at many of the ports of the United Kingdom. The Return lately presented shows that 1,990 aliens, not stated to be  en route
(10.59.)  MR. P. J. POWER : There is an item in this Vote for the temporary Chairman of the County and City of Waterford, and I take the opportunity of asking the Chief Secretary some information in reference to the removal of Judge Waters, who has made himself obnoxious by his reversal of the decisions of Removable Magistrates. It would be gratifying to me and to my constituents to have some explanation from the Government on this point, so that it may be known that this man has not been superseded because he would not allow himself to be made a Castle hack. The Chief Secretary has, in backing up his supporters whenever cases of this kind have been brought before him, done more to turn law and order in Ireland into a mockery than anything that has been done by Nationalist agitators. If they cannot openly convict Nationalists who may be accused of what they regard as a crime, the Government officials have a ready mode of action. I am reminded of a case in which a number of men were charged with riot. There was not a shred of evidence to substantiate that charge, and it was dismissed, but some of the defendants were ordered to find bail for their future good conduct. And
 615
(7.20.)  MR. P. J. POWER  (Waterford, E.) : In the action of the Government towards Justices of the Peace we have ceased to expect impartiality. In my own case I was knocked off the Commission for doing what I really believed to be my duty, and many of my fellow Magistrates took similar action to mine,
 587
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : The statement of the right hon. Gentleman fairly meets that which I had to bring before the Committee. A paper has been sent out from the convict prison of Peterhead calling attention to the point. I had intended to say that as Scotland contributes at least its fair share to the Imperial Treasury, I think an end should be put to the degradation of Scotch labour by paying officials in Scotland at a lower rate than officials in England. I will not, however, continue the discussion.
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War when he intends to issue the Warrant with reference to the rank and position of the Army Medical Department?
*(5.11.)  MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I quite agree with the previous speaker that there is a glaring defect in the Crofters Act which prevents the crofters getting more land. The small crofters is a rule have not more than a few acres if land, although there are in the Highlands vast tracts of country in which there is scarcely a house to be seen, and although within human recollection there was a large population there. There is a universal feeling in the Highlands in favour of getting back what are called the ancient homes of the people. The Crofters Act contains machinery for giving the crofters additional land, but it does not work. Of course, if Parliament passed a very stringent Act to enable land to be taken from the present holders at its fair value, and allocated to the crofters, they would have difficulty in getting stock and providing houses for themselves. Some plan might be devised for easing that difficulty and for getting
 572
 MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether he is aware that Messrs. Holland & Hannen, contractors for work at the British Museum, have reduced the painters' wages to 7½d. per hour when the contract provided for payment at the rate of 8½d. per hour; and whether, if this is so, he will communicate with Messrs. Holland and Hannen on the subject, with a view to the payment of the rate of wages contemplated when the contract was given them?
 MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : I had intended to ask the President of the Government Board whether he will consent to the Return showing the Grants made from taxation in aid of local purposes in the counties of England and Wales, in 1890–91? but as the right hon. Gentleman has already answered a question upon the same subject it is not necessary that I should put the question.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : Will the right hon. Gentleman also produce the letters to and from the Lord Chancellor?
 MR. SEXTON : That is not a very satisfactory answer. It is now three years—I rather think four years—since my hon. Friend commenced interrogating the right hon. and learned Gentleman in this House as to the case of this Magistrate. This case is a manifest scandal, and something should be done in regard to it. This man Magan committed a fraud
 588
 MR. SEXTON : I have pointed out that in one year there have been only four riots in all Ireland, and the Constitution ought not to be suspended for a contingency so rare.
(6.3.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : The Irish Estimates are naturally, in some degree, affected by the circumstances of the time. The policy which governs the administration of Ireland is now substantially different from what it was in former and in recent years. There has been a change of tone on the part of the Government, and there has been a change of policy even more important still. We hear no more about Hottentots, or about the people using weapons, and there is nothing at all said about 20 years of coercion or firm government. The Chief Secretary looks upon the Land Bill, and upon the forthcoming measure of Local Government, as important in affecting the condition of Ireland, and I confess, in view of these facts, I am not disposed to look so minutely into the items of this Vote as I would have done in former years. I recognise that the Tory Party have left the policy of coercion, and are now proposing to adopt Home Rule. Under these exceptional, and, perhaps, pregnant circumstances, I must say that the amount of this Vote appears enormous compared with the number of prosecutions. The cost of criminal prosecutions in England, with its 30,000,000 of inhabitants, is £66,000; while in Ireland, with one-seventh the population, the cost is £75,000, or one-sixth greater. When we find the followers of the Chief Secretary glorifying him for the success which he has achieved in Ireland during the four years of his administration, I should expect to find some practical test of the truth of such a boast on the reduction of the Vote which now engages the attention of the Committee. Practically, there is no decrease in the Vote, and there has been no decrease in it in recent years. Why is it, if the Chief Secretary has been so signally successful by means of coercive legislation in suppressing disorder, that there is no corresponding reduction in this amount? The real meaning of what is called success may be a matter of controversy
 577 Dublin Gazette 578 579
(10.20.)  MR. SEXTON : I cannot sympathise with the highly poetical peroration of the right hon. Gentleman as to the Resident Magistrates being the mainstay of justice and liberty in Ireland. As to the Revising Barristers, I regret that the right hon. Gentleman avoided the question, and that he did not give us an assurance in regard to the next appointments. There has been something of indecency in the way in which the Government have made, the appointments in the past. I am not going so far as to say that I do not think a strong Party man could be a good Revising Barrister; but, still, I would invite the Government to give the Liberals and Nationalists a chance when the next appointments are made. With regard to the Resident Magistrates, no doubt they were more numerous in Lord Spencer's day. If I am not mistaken the present number, which is 72 or 74, is
 610 611
 MR. SEXTON : What has been the highest number during the administration of the right hon. Gentleman?
 MR. SEXTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman adopt the suggestion that the Land Commission should address a remonstrance to the Salters' Company in relation to their demands upon their tenants for arrears, and to the threatened evictions?
(9.25.)  MR. SEXTON : Although the question of the Salters' Estate is outside the scope of the Vote, I do think that the Land Commission, in the exercise of their functions, could interpose. 242 families are threatened with eviction by reason of the demands made upon them. Those demands are in contravention of the rules of the Land Commission and of the spirit of the law. The Salters' Company deceived the Land Commission in the matter of the facts relating to the sales. The London Companies are amenable to public opinion; and if the Land Commission, in the exercise of their functions, were to address to the Salters' Company a public letter detailing the facts and laying emphasis on the circumstance that they procured the sale of the estate by concealment of facts, I imagine it would lead to a cessation of proceedings. I am disposed to agree with my hon. and learned Friend with regard to the collection of agricultural statistics. The Department of the Registrar General is totally impartial as between landlord and tenant, and its statistics would be regarded with more confidence than those collected under the superintendence of Mr. Wrench. My hon. Friend has referred to the question of the salaries of the Commissioners, but it will be time to discuss the larger scheme of amalgamation when we have it actually before us. What we have before us now is the fact that in the Land Purchase Bill the Government have declared equality of position between the five Commissioners. The moment when that equality of position can be exercised has not yet arrived. Equality of position should carry with it
 601 602
 MR. SEXTON : What about the Bankruptcy Bill?
(7.55.)  MR. SEXTON : The statement of the right hon. Gentleman is very satisfactory, but I must say his policy lags very far behind it. The Act establishing local Courts of Bankruptcy in Belfast and Cork allows a dual jurisdiction to continue absolutely unchecked by any power placed in the hands of the creditors. I believe that in England it is possible for creditors to secure the local administration of the estate of a debtor. But though the learned Attorney General has referred in terms of pride to the initiation of the system of local Bankruptcy Courts in Ireland, I must tell him that the evils of the old system still prevail there. A creditor may take a debtor away from a local Court, or a roguish debtor may run away from his creditors to Dublin, and in the case of creditors whose interest in the estate is not very large, they, as a rule, will not follow the bankrupt, though if they do the consequence is that the estate gets dissipated. The lawyers do not object to this, because they get higher fees in Dublin, and the Bankruptcy Court in Dublin is well satisfied, as it wants to maintain itself and keep down the local Courts. But credit is injured, creditors are robbed, and the local courts are deprived of what ought to be their proper business. All this Session I have been pressing
 592
(11.53.)  MR. SEXTON : The extensive scope of the speech of the hon. Member for Peterborough has been still further widened by the speech of the hon. and gallant Member for Galway. It is quite true that the citizens of Dublin are more heavily taxed than the citizens of any other city in the United Kingdom for the support of the local police force, and yet the Local Authority has no share or control or even influence over the force. It is a fact that if the Corporation of Dublin
 621
(12.45.)  MR. SEXTON : It seems to me that it is too late to proceed with the Vote, considering that we have to meet at 12 o'clock to-morrow. I would propose that this Vote should be postponed, and that we should take the next two Irish Votes. One of these Votes is that relating to Reformatory and Industrial Schools, and I had intended to raise a question on it; but if the right hon. Gentleman will adopt the course I suggest, I will postpone my remarks to the Report stage.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : If it should not be found possible to conclude the remaining Irish Votes before 6 o'clock to-morrow, so far as we are concerned, we should not mind sitting a little later.
(12.55.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I wish to refer to the case of James McGrath, upon which I made some observations yesterday. I think I conveyed to the Committee that the relatives of this deceased person had no notice whatever of his having been seized with acute tuberculosis, but in this I was wrong, as is shown in a letter I have received from McGrath's mother. I do not wish it to be supposed that I would not correct an error as soon as I became aware that I had fallen into one. I think, however, that in the case of this man the conduct of the gaol officials was harsh, and that they ought to have given notice to the relatives earlier than they did.
(8.56.)  MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : When this Vote was discussed last year, I referred to the question of the
 596 597 bona fides 598
(9.50.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I hope the discontinuance of the service of men whose term will expire in August next will not prejudice claims to appointment on the permanent staff.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Every newspaper in the country gives what are called market reports, and if such reports were not correct the newspapers would not be bought. In the Dublin papers, of all shades of opinion, reports are given of the prices obtained at the different markets, and no one challenges their accuracy. I strongly object to Mr. Wrench being allowed to boss the collection of these statistics under a system which originally arose out of a state of circumstances very different to the present. I am satisfied that a clerk in the Registrar General's office could day by day gather
 600
 MR. T. M. HEALY : The Registrar General has been collecting these statistics. Are there to be two bodies collecting statistics?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I assume that though the tenure of office expires on August 22, the men will be retained while there are fair rent cases to decide?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Now that the "bitter cry" arises from Liberal Unionism it ought to receive attention.
(9.55.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : The Chief Secretary, in the course of debate last week stated, in reply to myself, that the Government had, as a matter of fact, reduced the number of Resident Magistrates in Ireland. He stated that, whereas the number during the time of Earl Spencer's administration was 85, it is now 72. That statement requires some explanation, because, looking at the Votes for 1890–91 and for the present year, I find in each case the number given as 74, and the total expenditure £40,450. It will not be disputed that 1890–91 was, for the most part, a period of stringent coercion, so that we may assume that a full staff of Resident Magistrates were employed. But the number still appears to be 74. After our long Debates I will not say more upon this now, but I think the entire question of Resident Magistrates should be looked into. We are a long way from the days when the Duke of Wellington appointed Resident Magistrates as a mode of relieving the local population, and as a protection against the local gentry and Magistrates. In my boyish days I remember the Resident Magistrates, then called Stipendiaries, were regarded as decent
 605 v 606 607
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Why are they sent out of their own districts to attend Licensing Sessions? Licensing Sessions, surely, have nothing to do with the government of the country.
(2.20.)  MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : This Bill contains a provision which I have not the smallest doubt will by and bye be thrown in our faces as a great evidence of the generosity of England towards Ireland I refer to the remission of loans in respect to the Ulster Canal. £120,000 has been advanced at various times to the Ulster Canal Company, and now yon propose to remit the debt. £120,000 is a large sum, and I object very strongly to its being written off. What have the Government done to recover the amount? Have they put anybody in gaol? Have they tried to make anybody bankrupt? There are many remedies that might have been tried. Surely the resources of civilisation are not exhausted. The Government are very sparing in their dealings with bog tenants, but when they come to deal with a Canal Company they are suddenly animated by the most generous feelings. My mind travels back to the time when you lent £2,250,000 sterling to the Irish parsons, a loan which you also wiped off. A Bill of this kind ought certainly not to be passed  sub silentio
(2.49.)  MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : No doubt the Ulster Canal, dealt with in this Resolution, is in a derelict way, but the right hon. Gentleman opposite will remember how badly we were treated when the Ulster Canal Bill was going through. He will remember that the result of that treatment has been that we have been deprived of anything like an explanation as to how the Government treated the Ulster Canal Company. As I understand it, the Government took hold of this canal in return for £120,000 they had lost, and they now hand it over to someone else not only without this £120,000, but with an offer of £5,000 or £6,000 in addition. We are entitled to know what transactions have taken place in regard to this matter. I would suggest that in order to keep a grip on those to whom the canal is to be transferred (I forget the name of the company) the Government should hold this loan of £120,000 over them  in terrorem
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : What are the relations between this Bill and the measure introduced earlier in the Session?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg respectfully to say that I will look into the Act on that point.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : It would not be fair to keep the House until a late hour on this Resolution, but when the Bill gets into Committee I will raise the point in detail.
(4.52.)  MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : There are still one or two points on which we ought to get some information from the Government before these Votes are passed. We ought to know what is the probable duration of the Crofters' Commission, and to get some explanation of the very heavy increase in the expenses of the Commission. The expenses of the Commission in the first year were £400, but year by year they have increased until last year the
 569 570
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : I do not know whether this is relevant to the Resolution before the House, the object of which is merely to authorise the allocation of funds to the purposes of a Bill. I would point out that the debt it is proposed to remit is not owing by the body to whom the Ulster Canal is handed over, therefore I do not see in what way the one matter is connected with the other. When we release the persons who originally borrowed the £120,000, we shall not have more powers lover the canal than we have at
 644
(2.25.)  THE SECRETARY TO THETREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : With regard to the writing off of the Ulster Canal Debt, I may point out that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer commenced the Local Loans Fund this debt was not taken as an asset. The hon. and learned Gentleman wants to know what steps have been taken to recover the amount. I believe previous Governments took
 640
 MR. RATHBONE  (Carnarvonshire, Arfon) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he will use his influence with Sanitary Authorities and other Bodies concerned with the public health to induce them to show what they may have of interest to foreign delegates attending the International Congress of Hygiene, to be held in London next month?
 *MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I think I have a right to claim that this Bill ought not to be proceeded with to-night. We have received solemn promises from the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that contentious business would not be taken at such times as the present. This Bill was highly contentious. Moreover, I charge the Government with attempting to deceive us. The title of the Bill is Public Works Loans Bill, and one reading that title would have thought it was a Bill to authorise the granting of loans. But by one of its provisions, as shown by the hon. and learned Member for North Longford, it remits a loan. Inasmuch as we have had no explanation of the Bill, and that there is an attempt to force it through the House at an unseemly hour, I beg to move that it be read a second time this day three months.
 *MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I have stopped here to oppose the Bill.
*(5.15.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I have taken opportunities during the last few years of going down among the crofters just to see what their grievances are, and I know it is a great grievance among them that the valuers are chosen from the ranks of farmers and factors, and that none of them are crofters. Surely the right hon. Gentleman the Lord Advocate might instruct the Commissioners to select some of the valuers from among the crofters themselves, so as to get at both sides of the question.
 *MR. MORTON : I should like to know how it is that the cost of the trial of election petitions is so much larger in Ireland than it is in England?
 MR. MORTON : I think we should have some reply from the Government Bench. If they refuse to reply, we must assume that the force is maintained for political purposes.
(11.38.)  MR. MORTON : On the Vote on Account I raised the question of the cost of these police. I find that the total cost of the Dublin Police is about £150,000 per annum. We were, however, told by the Secretary to the Treasury on the Vote on Account that the money which we were asked to vote from Imperial funds was merely a grant in aid. I have found since that this is very different to a vote in aid. The whole charge of the Dublin Metropolitan Police is put on the Imperial funds, with the exception of a local contribution of nearly £50,000. I object to the Imperial taxpayers being called upon to pay any more to the City of Dublin Police than they do to the police of any other part of the United Kingdom. The people of Dublin should be called upon to manage and to pay for their own police. Moreover, £150,000 appears to be a most extraordinary sum to pay for the police of
 619
*(11.20.)  MR. MORTON : I cannot agree with the action of the Removable Magistrates in Ireland during the past few years, and I am astonished to find that they have cost the Imperial Exchequer something like £50,000 per annum. We have no such charge in England or Wales. For my part, I should like to see these Magistrates elected by the people instead of being appointed by the Government. It is only Magistrates so elected who can give satisfaction to the people. It is not likely that the country can be satisfactorily governed under Magistrates who have not the confidence of the people. As the representative of an English constituency, I heartily concur in what has been said by the Irish Members on this subject, and shall gladly vote for the reduction of the Estimate.
 MR. GOURLEY  (Sunderland) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether the French Squadron now in the Baltic is to visit Portsmouth on the 20th August; and whether the visit is due to an invitation from any competent authority; if so, will the arrangements for the reception be on a scale similar to that accorded to the French Fleet which visited Portsmouth in 1865?
 SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN  (Durham, S.E.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the
 548
 SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he will take into consideration the great inconvenience caused in the neighbourhood of Darlington by there being only one postal delivery in the day at a place within a mile and a half of the General Post Office, while there are two and three deliveries in the day at places further off; and why it is necessary that a telegram, handed in at Charing Cross at 6.30 on Sunday evening, cannot be delivered within a mile and a half of Darlington before 8.30 the following morning, thereby losing the benefit of the early train from the North to London?
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : Such complaints have been made, and I believe that many such cases have occurred as are described in the second question. All the information in our possession, as well as a statement of the steps taken to warn British subjects against emigrating to Brazil, will be found in the Correspondence which will be in the hands of hon. Members in a day or two.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON  said: If any particular inquiry is desired by individuals it will certainly be made.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham) : The best answer I can give to the hon. Member is to read the following telegram which was received from the Viceroy to-day, and which contains the latest information upon the subject. It is dated the 28th of July, 1891, and is from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State—
 "There is an improvement in agricultural prospects and development of monsoon season. There has been good general rainfall throughout the country except in the Madras Carnatic, and Upper Burma, in consequence of which there is no present cause of anxiety in Northern India. Strong monsoon blowing west coast. More rain imminent in Punjab and Rajputana, where fodder famine has been arrested by rain. Crop operations in Northern India generally progressing satisfactorily, and there is no present cause for anxiety in the North West Provinces and Oudh. Rain fell last week in Coimbatore region, slightly improving the condition of affected districts, but has ceased. With development of monsoon in Northern India, locust plague abating. In Northern India prices abating where there has been rain, hut information incomplete."
 SIR J. PEASE  (Durham, Barnard Castle) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what are the general conclusions arrived at by the Home Office Committee appointed some months ago to consider the grievances of prison officers?
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : There are, as my noble Friend is probably aware, two qualifications—one the ownership of property, the other occupation, As regards the property qualification, it is not necessary that the property should be situated in the county for which the owner is to act as a Justice of the Peace. As regards the occupation qualification, a property occupied must be situated in the county.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : A temporary Bill was passed to enable the office to be carried on pending the passing of this measure.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : As I understand the matter, there is a strong feeling in the House that that part of the measure should be passed which will deprive clergymen of the Established Church convicted of crimes of the power of performing their spiritual duties. I do not think that any pledge has been broken by the Bill being kept on the Paper.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : The Bill is simply to supplement the Act of last year by removing certain difficulties which have arisen in its working.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : It will not apply to Malta, because there is no Consulate there.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : The object of this Bill is to carry out important alterations and Amendments in consequence of the Middlesex Registry being abolished and transferred to the Land Registry Office. It will provide for the fees, which at present go to the Middlesex Registry Office, going to the Treasury. The Bill has been considered by the Incorporated Law Society, and there is nothing in it except that which will enable an economy to be effected in carrying out the business of the registry. I move that the Bill be read a second time.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : May I put a question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer?
(2.45.)  MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : I desire to ask whether the Government intend to proceed with this Bill or not? I would remind the hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney General that there are at least five notices of Motion on the Paper against the Bill already, and that there is very strong objection taken to it. It is too bad to keep Members up till 3 o'clock in the morning to oppose the Bill. I can assure the hon. and learned Member that it is a contentious Bill, and therefore comes within the pledge given by the Leader of the House, and ought not to be proceeded with at this period of the Session.
 MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : The remarks of the hon. Member have
 604
 SIR W. HART DYKE : I should say that it refers generally to attendance at political meetings.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : The Inspector of the district made a representation to the Department on the subject a few days ago, and, upon receiving from the Registrar General the exact figures of the recent Census, inquiry will be made into the sufficiency of the present school supply.
 THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford) : By an Order of the Lord President, dated January, 1880, the official staff of the Education Department were prohibited from taking an active part at political meetings in connection with Parliamentary elections, and I am not aware of any instances in which this rule has been violated.
 VISCOUNT CURZON  (Bucks, Wycombe) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether the estate qualification for the appointment of County Justices must necessarily be in respect of property
 560
 THE CHAIRMAN : It is not in order to go into events that took place two years ago unless they have a direct bearing on the present Vote.
(6.52.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE  (Carnarvon,  : I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time this day three months, on the ground that many Members who are interested in the Bill have left the House under the impression that it was not to be taken.
 An hon. MEMBER : Christians first.
 DR. TANNER : I may say in connection with the manufacture of the parcel post baskets in prisons where typhoid fever is prevalent, they must necessarily carry disease and death to a number of places outside. If disease can be carried into a gaol by means of the milk, how much more is disease likely to be spread over a whole country by parcel post baskets manufactured in a gaol where fever is prevalent. Of course, disease is more likely to be engendered in gaols where, for the first month, the prisoners are placed on an abnormally low diet which is absolutely insufficient to afford them proper nourishment. I have learned this fact from personal experience. Men who otherwise would throw off an attack of typhoid fever, because of their good constitution, may have their health seriously endangered by the prostration consequent on improper food. I would, therefore, ask the Chief Secretary to give the utmost consideration to the case of those who suffer from the insanitary condition and the insufficient dietary of
 689
(5.0.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I merely rise for the purpose of bringing this discussion to a definite issue by moving that the Vote be reduced by the sum of £5,000. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that in respect of the outbreak of fever at Tullamore I moved last week for a Return, and it was definitely promised that it would be in our hands before this Debate. I am sorry to say that it has not been produced, and that we are compelled to discuss this matter without having before us a record of the facts. It is well to mention one source of peril to the public health which has not come under notice. I am informed that the prisoners in the gaols of Ireland make the baskets which are used in the Parcels Post Delivery Service, so that you have been sending out from fever-stricken gaols, all over the country, the means of spreading infection to every home. The theory that the fever was
 687
(5.40.)  MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I rise to make an appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It would hardly be fair to ask the right hon. Gentleman the Vice President of the Council to make his annual statement at this period of the Sitting. In face of the promise of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that he would not ask the House to sit after half past 6 on Wednesdays, there is no possibility of completing the discussion to-night, and I would suggest that the Vote should be postponed and taken to-morrow, after the consideration of the Lords Amendments to the Education Bill.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I will look into the matters put before me by the hon. Member, and will see what can be done in regard to them. With regard to what has been said about the warders, I will see whether there is any ground for thinking that they are unduly deprived of any holiday. As to the question of the prison dietary, I would remind the Committee that the whole subject was carefully gone into by the Royal Commission which considered the subject two years ago. The present dietary in the Irish prisons was, I
 688
(6.0.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I certainly do not think the hon. Gentleman has gone beyond his province in pressing the claims of this school on the favourable consideration of the Treasury, with whom the matter rests. But we must also take into account the state of the Industrial School Vote. In 1880–81 the amount granted for industrial and reformatory schools in Ireland was £72,000. It grew steadily, year by year, until when I came into office it had risen to £91,000, and since 1886 it has further risen to £99,000.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. Gentleman is requesting a further increase in the Vote, but there are several points to be taken into account in considering this subject. In the first place, the Treasury naturally object to dealing with the question in Ireland on a wholly different principle from that which is adopted in England and Scotland. The system, though nominally the same, is different in Ireland, and it is different to the advantage of the Irish industrial schools. This
 692
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I believe the industrial schools are admirably managed in Ireland. A good case for the children can always be made out, and it is a disagreeable and an onerous task for the Chief Secretary of the day to have to refuse these applications, as he is too often obliged to do. I have every desire to aid the institution to which the hon. Gentleman has called the attention of the House, and the utility of which I fully recognise; but, under the circumstances, I do not think I could induce the Treasury to sanction additional expenditure.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Well, Parliamentary argument. In other words, if the Cullinane case can be brought under broad general principles on which the cases of prisoners similarly situated can also be dealt with, I am quite willing that Cullinane should have the full benefit of it. But if, on consultation with the English authorities, it is held to be impossible to bring the case under such broad general principles, we must return to the Prison Rules, which the Prisons Board have been carrying out with no animus to particular individuals. They have always desired to see cases dealt with on broad general principles without exceptions being made in the case of particular individuals, and I, myself, am anxious that justice should be done on the broad lines I have indicated.
(4.20.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : With regard to the case to which the hon. and learned Gentleman has drawn my attention, there must always be a certain degree of doubt as to the origin of the disease. I am inclined to think that it is not absolutely impossible that, owing to certain structural defects in the main drains, John Cullinane may have contracted the typhoid fever in the gaol a few days before he would have teen released. The facts are being looked into, and the defects in the drains, if any, will be remedied. There is no doubt that the disease came upon Cullinane in a pronounced form within a
 678 679
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Well, this is a matter upon which there is no agreement; but with regard to future action I may say that I intend to consult English Prison Authorities to see what the practice in England is in cases such as that before the Committee, and if I find myself able to make any general relaxation or modification in the prison rules in order to meet the case of John Cullinane, or if, without making any general alteration in the rules, I find I can meet that case I will do so. But the hon. Member must see that unless we want to bring them into a state of confusion Public Departments must be bound by general principles of policy that cannot and ought not to be relaxed in consequence of Parliamentary pressure.
(2.50.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I hope that this discussion will soon be brought to an end. I will inquire into the points that have been raised, and I think we may—in view of the understanding come to last night—pass on to the consideration of the next Vote, which is one of considerable interest, and upon which I understand some important questions are to be raised.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : No doubt some extra force will be there required. But I will read the list of counties. On July 1, 1890, there were 144 extra police in Clare, and this number it is not proposed to reduce. In the East Riding of Cork there were 200; there are now 155—a diminution of 45, which I hope will be further reduced. In the West Riding of Cork there were 81 in 1890; there are now 68, and I hope for a further reduction. In Donegal there is apparently an increase, 30 more now than there were in 1890. In the East Riding of Galway there were 90 last year, and we propose to reduce the number by 10. In the West Riding of Galway, 15 last year, now 10, which we propose to remove. In Kerry last year 300,
 657 658
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am distinctly informed that the building for the men was intended to be on plot A, and was to be erected before the stables, which were to be on plot B, and that no change in that respect has been made.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The hon. Gentleman states with accuracy the contention of Musgrave & Co., and I am far from accusing them of wilful misstatement, but, of course, they are an interested party and want to get the fine under agreement. This statement is in direct contradiction to that of the Constabulary authorities, that the alleged change of plan really never took place. I state the facts as they are represented to me, and if the hon. Member desires further information on the matter I shall be happy to obtain it. I pass to the more general part of the speech of the hon. Gentleman, which followed on the lines previously recapitulated by another hon. Gentleman last night, and turned in the main on the increased cost of the Police Force during the last 50 or 60 years, during which he is quite correct in saying the population of Ireland has undergone a large diminution. While no doubt the population of Ireland has largely diminished during the last 50 or 60 years, I know of no statistics indicating that the prosperity of the country has otherwise than steadily increased in spite of the temporary difficulties agriculture had to meet in the disastrous years 1878–83. To argue that crime has increased because more money has been spent on the police is to ignore the plainest lesson of contemporary history. There was a time when a few worn-out old watchmen sufficed for police purposes in London. I do not know what the cost in proportion to population was; but whatever it was, I know it represents but a small fraction of that which the ratepayers now have to spend on the Metropolitan Police Force. The fact is, that the requirements of the community have enormously increased. It will be found that while crime—I am speaking of the United Kingdom—has steadily diminished and every element of prosperity has augmented, such diminution of crime and such augmentation of prosperity have not been accompanied by any lessening in the expenditure on police. I have not, I admit, prepared myself to verify these generalisations as to the cost of police in Great Britain; but I feel quite sure that if the present century
 656
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I gather that that is not so. What I understand to be the policy pursued is that the accommodation for the men is to be completed first.
(1.5.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : The speech of the hon. Gentleman divides itself into two parts—the second part dealing with a rather complicated transaction, and one chiefly of local interest. I am not sure that I am in possession of detailed knowledge for dealing quite fully with that part of the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I think I can give the Committee briefly such an explanation as may be sufficient to show how the matter stands. The site for the Police Barracks, as the hon. Gentleman has stated, consists of two parts obtained from the Corporation, those two parts being subject to different private rights—the eastern portion, or plot A, and the western portion, or plot B. The latter is subject to complicated private arrangements, rendered more complicated because both parties to the arrangements have the same name. The one is Musgrave & Co. (Limited), and the other Musgrave Brothers. Musgrave & Co. (Limited) are anxious to be disturbed in order to get the £3,000 or £4,000
 654
 *MR. SPEAKER : The Question before the House is the Adjournment of the Debate.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The Question now is that the word "now" stand part of the Question.
 *MR. SPEAKER : This is a new Question.
 *MR. RITCHIE : That is all. There has not been the slightest difficulty about the exercise of the power before now, nor do I anticipate any now.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : It is not proposed to renew the provision beyond the present year, but, as the hon. Member knows, there are matters of some complexity which arise in connection with the change in the date of the County Council elections; and therefore the Local Government Board have thought it necessary to take this power to cover the period of the next elections for the assistance of Local Authorities in technical difficulties that may arise.
(6.37.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I was present when the First Lord of the Treasury made his statement, and the impression left on my mind is that he said the Government would not proceed with contentious business. He especially mentioned this Bill, but he mentioned it in the sense that it was not a contentious Bill, because it had the support of the Leader of the Opposition. I did not understand that he in any way abandoned the offer he made not to proceed with contentious business. I do not express an opinion as to the merits of the Bill one way or the other; but I must say it appears to me, from what has taken place to-day, that it is a contentious Bill. ["No, no!"] That remonstrance proves it, and, therefore, to proceed with the Bill now would be to violate the understanding entered into with the First Lord of the Treasury. As the Bill deals with ecclesiastical matters, in which I take an interest, I shall feel bound to support the Motion for the adjournment of the Debate.
 MR. PICKERSGILL : Such orders will relate merely to elections?
(6.12.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : By this Bill it is proposed to continue a small portion—Sub-section 3 of Section 108—of the Local Government Act, which gives power to make orders on the application of County Councils, an unusual power given to a Department to modify a general enactment. Originally the power was limited to six months, and it was given, I presume, as a means of tiding over difficulties inseparable from the launching of a great scheme for the reform of local government, but year by year the power has been renewed in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. I do not quite understand the operation of the section, whether it merely continues the orders made within the first six months, or allows further orders to be made from time to time.
 CAPTAIN BETHELL  (York, E.R., Holderness) : I rise to order. The hon. Member has spoken on this Question.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : It is hardly correct to state that I said the other day we should not sit beyond half-past six o'clock to-day; but I admit that I gave an impression that we would not ask the House to sit much after seven or half-past seven. I may add that, having watched this Debate, I do not see much hope of being able to conclude it this evening in the time we have at our disposal, although I protest against the imputation that we are not acting entirely within both the letter and the spirit of our statement. Therefore, if the Motion for the adjournment of the Debate is pressed, I shall not resist it.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I have said I would not ask the House to sit after half past 6; but, under the circumstances, I hope the Committee will fall in with the suggestion that the Vote should be taken after the Lords Amendments to the Education Bill to-morrow. I know by experience that Scotland and Ireland must be treated precisely in the same way as England in this respect, and therefore I suggest that we should also postpone the Irish and Scotch Education Votes, and make progress with the other Votes in the Class.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I would ask to be allowed to say a word to remove the impression that the First Lord of the Treasury gave a pledge not to proceed with this Bill. I am certain that the impression on the mind of the Leader of the House and on that of the right hon. Member for Mid Lothian was that they were entitled to proceed with the Bill. I have had an opportunity of seeing my right hon. Friend since he spoke on this subject, and he confirms me in this. Both he and the right hon. Member for Mid Lothian were under the impression that the Bill would go forward, notwithstanding that they saw that in certain
 698
(6.22.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I may remind the House that a few days ago I announced the intention of the Government to withdraw the whole of the measure with the exception of the first four clauses, which are not contentious, and which provide that when clergymen are found guilty of any crime they shall lose their livings. This will remedy the existing state of things, under which clergymen convicted of the most serious offences are not compelled to vacate their benefices. I scarcely think there will be any objection on the part of anyone in the House to those clauses, but I will not press the matter further at this period of the Session, if there is likely to be any great opposition. I do not think that hon. Members belonging to other Churches will stand in the way of those who belong to the Church of England securing immunity from a scandal which must hurt the feelings of all. If the House will now read the Bill a second time I propose in Committee to make the alterations I have referred to.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The hon. Member will allow me to remind him that my right hon. Friend specially exempted this Bill.
 *MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I think it will be remembered that in mentioning this Bill the First Lord of the Treasury gave us to under stand it would not be taken in the ab-
 696
*(6.31.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I think it due to the right hon. Gentleman to state what my impression is as to the arrangement come to in reference to this Bill. My recollection does not tally with that of the hon. Member for Rugby. I understood the Government to say that they would not deal with any contentious business this Session except this Bill. This measure has been excepted all the way through. The First Lord of the Treasury pointed out to us that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian took a strong and deep interest in the Bill, and on that ground it was accepted; therefore, I have regarded it all" the way through as one of the Bills which the Government were at liberty to deal with as they thought proper. The compromise the Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed seems to me a fair one. The portion of the Bill to which exception was taken was the constitution of the new Ecclesiastical Court and its complicated method of procedure. Great difference of opinion must arise as to that; but I cannot think that there can be any difference of opinion as to the necessity of depriving a responsible public official of his position if he is convicted of a heinous and grievous offence. There is no doubt—as the legal Members of the House know—that there are certain grave offences of which a clergyman may be convicted of without being thereby deprived of his living. That is a state of law which should not exist. When a man has committed such offences he should cease to occupy the responsible public position he holds. I hope we shall not embark on any debateable and controversial matter on this Bill as affecting the Establishment question or any other question. This appears to be a  bonâ fide 697
 *MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : As to the understanding arrived at, my memory is clear that while the Leader of the House was dealing with the general principle of not taking contentious business, he put this Bill out of the category as one on which he wished to hear the views of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian before proceeding further. From that time to this I have thought the Government justified in going on with the Bill if they thought fit to do so. I shall vote against the Motion for Adjournment. It seems to me that to demand the Disestablishment of the Church in order to make a man vacate his living for immorality, is going a long way round.
 *MR. H. J. WILSON : As to the pledge of the Leader of the House, I do not pretend to have any clear recollection, but as there seems to be a strong difference of opinion on the matter, I would appeal to the Government whether it is fair to press the Bill forward at this period of the Session.
*(6.39.)  MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : The hon. Member for Glamorganshire just now made a remark about Disestablishment, and it was received with disapprobation from the other side. But there are many others of us in this House who agree with him. No one in the position of a clergyman should be allowed to remain in possession of his benefice if he commits a grave offence, but we should not be called on to deal with such cases in this House. We do not do so in the case of clergymen of any other denomination than the Established Church. The proper way to deal with those mattters is to put the Church of England in the same position as other denominations.
*(2.25.)  MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : I desire briefly to refer to one point which has already been brought forward in this Debate. I allude to the question of numbering the Irish police, which I think deserves some more definite answer than has been given by the Chief Secretary. Undoubtedly, if these men were frequently moved from one part of Ireland to another there might be some difficulty in arranging the numbers, but I cannot see why this should create any more difficulty in Ireland than in London, where, whenever a disturbance is expected, or some great function is going on, the police are brought from all parts of the Metropolis to districts to which they do not belong. Nevertheless, if any question occurs as to misconduct or excess of duty on the part of the Metropolitan police, there is no difficulty in identifying the men. Granting, for the sake of argument, that
 666
 MR. FLYNN : And to the expense of the force.
(2.38.)  MR. FLYNN : The question of the Tipperary sureties is not relevant to the Vote now before the Committee, and, therefore, I will not deal with it. But I wish to point out that the Chief Secretary was placed in a very curious position in trying to answer the weighty speech of my hon. Friend the Member
 668 669
(5.15.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I want to bring to the notice of the Chief Secretary the fact that the diet for the prisoners for the first month is positively cruel. It is so low that they are starved, and then become ill. The men imprisoned for political offences are on a different footing from the class of habitual criminals. I believe that inquiry would show that the dietary of these political prisoners is much below what is necessary for the nourishment of a man, and must, therefore, have injurious effects upon them physically.
(2.10.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I desire to call attention to the question of numbering the Irish Constabulary. The Chief Secretary has already given an answer on that subject, which, however, I do not think very satisfactory. The necessity for numbering these men arises in consequence of the difficulty of recognising or identifying them when they are charged with misconduct. The person aggrieved simply sees a number of men all dressed and helmeted exactly alike, and for the most part wearing moustachios, the general resemblance being so strong that it is difficult to
 664 665
 COLONEL NOLAN : It is clear now that the whole of the prisoners must have been wrong, and that they were not hungry or ill when they said they were. The moment the Chief Secretary says this or that has been done on the recommendation of a Royal Commission he absolves himself from all responsibility, and we must accept the situation, because anything a Royal Commission does must be right, and we ought not to believe any amount of evidence to the contrary by whomsoever it may be given.
*(7.10.)  MR. TALBOT  (Oxford University) : I will not follow the hon. Gentleman opposite in the minute criticisms he has passed on this Bill, for which I do not consider this the proper opportunity, but I wish to offer a word of protest against the attitude taken by him and other hon. Members below the Gangway. They profess that they do not desire to interfere with the action of the Church in regard to these matters, but their action belies their professions, because by their action they are doing what they can to fasten on the Estab-
 703 non possumus
*(4.40.)  MR. P. O'BRIEN : I desire to offer the Committee the evidence of one on the spot in connection with this matter. It has been my good, or evil, fortune to be imprisoned in Tullamore with my friend Mr. Cullinane for some months. I can bear out what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for West Belfast as to the culpable neglect of the Government in the matter, and as to the consequences which followed. In the beginning of November I complained to the prison doctor, and to the Governor, and to the Visiting Justices, and said I felt sure that I was suffering from the germs of typhoid. The doctor asked why I thought so, and I told him I felt the evidences of it in the closets, and I said I was certain that the system of drainage was absolutely dangerous. He replied that I was mistaken, and that the arrangements were in accordance with the requirements of sanitary science. But I would point out that ordinary prisoners received better treatment than prisoners under the Coercion Act, inasmuch as they were allowed more frequent exercise. Mr. Cullinane and myself were confined to our cells for 22 out of the 24 hours, and were, therefore, more exposed to the dangers of the poisoned air. I said to the officer that I was satisfied he had done everything he could, and that in my opinion it was the system of drainage which was bad. I was slow to complain, because I remembered that my late lamented friend John Mandeville was charged with malingering, and I was prepared to sacrifice my life rather than lay myself open to such a charge. The doctor, I feel bound to say, was ready to send me to the hospital, but I would not go; but I warned him that he was very likely to have typhoid fever in the prison. The place was infested by rats. I have seen rats in the exercise yard, and I have found rats about me, and if straws show the direction of the wind, rats show the condition of the drains. But I was assured by the Governor that I was mistaken, and that everything was perfectly right. I had occasion also to complain of the water, which I submitted to the doctor. He analysed
 683 684 685 686
 *MR. P. O'BRIEN : I hope the Chief Secretary will endeavour to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission with a view of reducing the long hours during which the warders are employed in the Irish gaols. Their duties are of a most painful character. They go on duty early, and are kept until very late, and I think the right hon. Gentleman would do well to assent to some relaxation in the hours they work.
*(3.8.)  MR. P. O'BRIEN  (Monaghan, N.) : I entirely support the contention of my hon. Friend that the Police Force in Ireland is not efficient as far as strictly police duties are concerned. No doubt the Irish police are good marksmen, as many a family in Ireland has reason to know. But if you lose a rug off a car in Ireland, and give information
 672 673
 *MR. P. O'BRIEN : I respectfully accept your ruling, Mr. Chairman, but this matter has a direct bearing on the present Vote. While attempting to shake the hand of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cork, I was struck on the head by a policeman. I went outside the station, and there I was struck down with the butt end of a rifle and rendered insensible. The right hon. Gentleman has stated that everybody who has a grievance against the police has his remedy at law. I told the right hon. Gentleman that if he could help me to identify the officers who struck me I would proceed according to law. That is two years since, and I challenge the right hon. Gentleman even now to use the means at his disposal for procuring the identification of these country policemen. Of course, it was only a matter of my head being broken, but a couple of weeks ago a policeman who had been partially maimed by two Militiamen got £1,000 damages. I do not know what price to set on my cranium, but it has been useful to me, and I should like to keep it as a going concern. I should also like to take the opinion of a jury as to what it is worth. I have also to complain of the use made of the police in Ireland as jury-packers. Recently at Maryborough, pending the trial of the Donegal peasants charged with the murder of Police Inspector Martin, the officers of the police called in their men from the various stations, gave them copies of the jury panel, and told them to mark the religion and politics of each man, and to say whether he could be trusted by the Crown to give a verdict in accordance with the evidence. I have also to complain that the police are allowed on occasion to act as moonlighters. A constable by the name of Palmer was actually caught red-handed and given into the hands
 674
 MR. P. J. POWER  (Waterford, E.) : It is, I suppose, impossible for the right hon. Gentleman to answer the question as to policemen being numbered, but I assure him it will be raised again on Report and on the Appropriation Bill. I do not think it can be said that we have debated this subject at un-
 670 671
 MR. ESSLEMONT  (Aberdeen, E.) : I think it the duty of hon. Members on this side of the House to repudiate the accusation that because we desire this question to be discussed on its merits, we are, therefore, accessory to immorality. From the vote already taken we see that a considerable section of the House has a strong conscientious objection to the passage of this Bill, and I put it to the Government whether it is fair that a measure of this kind should be introduced not only at the end of the Session, but at the end of a long sitting, and at an hour when, we were told, the House would be adjourned? Many hon. Members have taken on good faith the promise that the House was not to sit after half-past six o'clock today, and have gone away. It is now getting on for half-past seven, and I put it to Her Majesty's Government whether it is treating us fairly to press this Bill any further to-night? I say that if these four clauses are to be passed they should be passed at a time when they can be considered exhaustively and upon their merits, and I fail to see why we are to be placed to-day under the shadow of the Leader of the Opposition, who, under the circumstances of which the House is well aware, ought not to have been brought into this discussion. The Government must see that there really is a serious opposition to this Bill, and they ought to show sufficient courtesy to let us know that we shall either have the necessary time to consider it or that it will be withdrawn.
 MR. NEVILLE  (Liverpool, Exchange) : In my view, to postpone dealing with a crying scandal until we can deal with Disestablishment would be an injustice, and therefore I shall support the Bill.
 MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : It is not at all our desire to leave a crying scandal in the Church, but I have to complain that these ecclesiastical questions always crop up at the end of the Session. Many Members interested have left the House, fully believing that the Government would not proceed with this Bill. This is decidedly a contentious Bill; even the clauses the Government propose to retain are full of anomalies, and are highly contentious. I certainly shall feel obliged to discuss the Bill during its progress through the House; and I hope my hon. Friend will press his Motion for the Adjournment of the Debate.
(7.20.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I quite agree with the statement of the last speaker, that this Bill is outside the letter of the compact with the Leader of the House, who specially reserved it for future consideration. Still, it is within the spirit of the compact come to on the 15th June, which was that no contentious business should be taken after that date. But now the Government cannot fail to see that this is contentious business, and, therefore, does not strictly come within the spirit of the compact. We have already this week had two late sittings, each of thorn extending to close upon 3 o'clock in the morning; and although we were led to understand that we were only to sit until half-past 6 o'clock to-day, it is now getting on for half-past seven. We are also perfectly certain to have some more late sittings, and, therefore, I think the Government might well spare us a few hours on a Wednesday evening, especially under the circumstances I have indicated.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : That is exactly my point. The Debate has been chiefly addressed to the question of the Examination Papers for the Royal Irish Constabulary, instead of, as usual, to the action of the police.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : Yes. The fact that we have been able to discuss these matters instead of dealing with riots and baton charges as in past years proves that the state of Ireland has vastly improved compared with a year or two ago. Now, I concur with hon. Members below the Gangway that the men of the Royal Irish Constabulary should be numbered. They are numbered in Belfast and Cork, and I do not see why they should not be in other parts of the country. If the right hon. Gentleman chose to instruct his subordinates at the Castle, a system of numbering sufficient for purposes of identification could easily be introduced, but if this proposal continues to be resisted, then I say, it will be open to the public to accuse the Government of desiring not to have the police identified when they come into collision with the people. The hon. Member for Longford (who spoke in a very low tone scarcely audible to anyone except those on the Front Bench) expressed a hope that as the Government had exempted one of the Tipperary sureties from his legal obligation, and that the Treasury would recoup to the other sureties the money that had been recovered. No doubt that proposal will receive favourable consideration at the hands of the Government. May I back it up by bringing this fact to the notice of the Chief Secretary: that the one man who has been exempted from payment of his bond was the man who perhaps more than any one else, was responsible for the state of affairs in Tipperary, and that the other three sureties were also the very heart of the conspiracy. I have been disappointed to some extent by the speeches of hon. Gentlemen below the Gangway. During the past year the police have had little else to do than to protect hon. Members from one another, and if any one has cause to be grateful to them, it surely is the hon. Member for Longford. Yet we have had no recognition of their services in this connection.
*(2.33.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I cannot help thinking that the character of the present Debate goes far to prove that the condition of Ireland to-day compares very favourably with what it was a few years ago. There have not been the customary references to baton charges.
 MR. SEXTON : There have been none lately.
 MR. SEXTON : Does the right hon. Gentleman intend to keep an extra force anywhere outside districts where Section 2 remains in full force?
 MR. SEXTON : The statement I have given on the authority of Musgrave & Co. is, that in the original plans the buildings on the B, or western site, were to be proceeded with, but in order to save the pockets of Musgrave Brothers the Board of Works and the Constabulary authorities had the plans so altered that the buildings on the A plot are to be provided for the men, and the stables on B, and the Inspector General reported that stables in the
 655
 MR. SEXTON : I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman on that point whether we are to understand that the barracks are to be completed before the officers' quarters are begun, or are they to be completed at the same time?
(3.28.)  MR. SEXTON : The reply of the right hon. Gentleman on the question of the extra force has been utterly unsatisfactory. My contention is that the extra force should only be retained in the one county where the Coercion Act is still continued fully in force. By the confession of the Government, there is not a shadow of a case for the continuance of the extra force elsewhere. I therefore move the reduction of the Vote by £65,000.
 MR. SEXTON : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will see the necessity of answering the questions that have been put to him.
(4.28.)  MR. SEXTON : I think we are entitled to something more than we have heard from the right hon. Gentleman. Whatever may be the general rule of the Prisons Board, the facts of the case of John Cullinane are such that we are entitled to expect that compensation will be made to him. May I remind the Committee of this circumstance: Cullinane was to have been released on the 1st of May, and attention was called to his case only by the fact that he was not released at the expiration of his sentence. All the proceedings in the prison were kept private. My hon. and learned Friend took up the matter, and by constantly asking questions and making speeches on the question of the adjournment of the House he elicited the facts. It was discovered that on the Friday previous to the date on which Cullinane ought to have been released there was a consultation between the prison doctor and the Medical Commissioner as to the state of the prisoner's health. The Medical Commissioner diagnosed influenza. There appears to be an impression at head-quarters that a local doctor cannot know as much as a member of the official hierarchy, so it was held that the diagnosis of the former, that Cullinane was suffering from typhoid, was incorrect. If the local doctor had been credited the prisoner might have been released, or might at least have been removed from the depressing atmosphere of a gaol. I therefore lay it down that the disease was not properly diagnosed, and that it was typhoid fever. I have also to complain of the very peculiar course which was pursued. We have asked for the appointment of a Commission again and again, and we have asked for the Report of the medical experts. The right hon. Gentleman told us that it would be obtained. It was moved for and ordered, but, up to the present moment, it has been impossible to get a sight of the Report, and we are obliged to discuss the question without the evidence. Then reference has been made to the milk, but, after careful examination, the analysts agreed that there was nothing whatever to complain of in the milk. The epidemic was undoubtedly from the sewers—from the fact of their

 MR. SEXTON : The first plans were drawn in the contrary way.
(12.25.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I would invite every Unionist who is confident in the success of the administration of the Chief Secretary to examine this Vote. He will discover from it that in proportion as we become poorer in Ireland—and we have become more poor from year to year—the cost of the police increases; that in proportion to the decrease of the population the more it costs to manage us; and that the fewer there are of us in the country the more police we require. My hon. Friend the Member for Waterford (Mr. Webb), in the careful and weighty speech which he delivered last night, reminded the Committee of various facts
 647 648 649 650 651 652 653
(5.55.)  MR. SEXTON : In Committee on this Vote I gave notice to the Chief Secretary that I would on this stage draw attention to the refusal of the Government to extend the number of certificates in the case of the Crumlen Street (Belfast) Industrial School for Roman Catholic girls. The school is one of the most efficient schools in Ireland. A few years ago, when the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. J. Lowther) was Chief Secretary, the case of the Belfast Catholic School was brought to his notice, and he consented to increase the number of certificates for males from 110 to 150, and the only reason assigned then for not extending the number of certificates in the case of girls was that
 691
 MR. SEXTON : The Corporation of Dublin give £10,000 a year.
 MR. SEXTON : Surely the right hon. Gentleman will not deny that as the cost of industrial schools rises so the cost of prisons goes down?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : It is not Parliamentary pressure; it is Parliamentary argument.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : The malady was not coming on when the prisoner entered the gaol. It was due to defective sanitary arrangements.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I desire to bring under the notice of the Government again the case of Mr. John Cullinane. I have to make a claim for compensation for that gentleman, or, at all events, for recoupment to him of his lodgings. He caught typhoid fever owing to the bad sewage arrangements of the prison, and was laid up for 49 days after his sentence of six months' imprisonment had expired. So absolutely mean have the Government shown themselves that, having despatched him with a third-class ticket, they refused to pay the doctor they had themselves called in as a second medical attendant. I have here a letter from Mr. Cullinane, which is certainly painful reading, as showing the treatment he received when he was in a sick state. He says he became ill on the 26th of April, nine days before his sentence expired. I have suggested to the Government that they should have discharged him there and then. On the 29th of April he was removed to hospital, where for three days he was attended by warders, who gave him some milk and some lemonade. Every morning in addition he was left with a pound of stale hard bread. On the 30th he had some beef-tea served to him in a dirty tin, and with such a scum on it that he could not use it, then he was asked to take some arrowroot, which was so badly served that he could not eat it. On the 1st of May two nurses came from Dublin, but for five days they could only visit him when the warder came. Whenever he wanted the nurses he had to get out of bed, walk across the room and ring a bell. I say that is a shocking way of treating a sick man. He says the nurses did everything in their power to make his position smooth, but whenever he was ordered chicken it came to him in a tin dish without a knife and fork. I would not treat my worst enemy in such a way. It must be remembered that at this time Mr. Cullinane was absolutely entitled to his discharge, and was kept in simply because he was unable to be removed. Then he says he was told it was influenza, and until he read the reports of my speeches in this House he never knew it

 MR. T. M. HEALY : I understand that there were two contracts originally, and that only one of them is to be gone on with. That is a very unsatisfactory position of affairs. What we want is to see the law take its course. When you have the money of the taxpayers in your pocket for the purpose of building, you should proceed with the contract. I know nothing about the Musgraves, but I take it that one of them must be

(6.29.)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir R. WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : The criticisms of the hon. Member are really not directed against the Second Reading, they are such as may be raised in Committee. There will be no objection to insert words to include other serious offences if the hon. Member desires to make the addition. That certain misdemeanours are not specified is not a real objection against the Bill, and I see no reason for adjourning the Debate, especially having regard to the general feeling in favour of the measure.
(6.55.)  MR. S. T. EVANS : Appeals have been made from various quarters of the House to the Government not to proceed with this Bill. I am sorry there is any misunderstanding as to the pledges that were given by the First Lord of the Treasury. The opponents of the Bill who recollect the pledge given intend to resist its progress at every stage, and it is therefore impossible for the Government to carry it. It is said by some Members on the Liberal side that those who oppose the Bill desire to perpetuate the scandals in the Church until it is disestablished. I fear those Gentlemen are Churchmen first and Liberals afterwards.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I am not sorry that those hon. Members have made the speeches to which we have listened, because I think it a good thing that their constituents should know that there are some people who call themselves Liberals, who are not yet prepared to go in for a measure of Disestablishment and Disendowment. ["Hear, hear!"] Hon. Members may think there are Members of that kind in the House now, but I can assure those who cheer that before long we shall have very few persons of that kind on these Benches. I say the Church of England has no right to take up the time of the nation in order that some of its members may be turned out. If we are to legislate on such a subject, I object to legislating piecemeal. It is

 MR. S. T. EVANS : I am very sorry I have to address the House again on this Question.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : The Bill was specially mentioned, but I am referring to another occasion when the First Lord of the Treasury indicated the Bills to be pushed forward to a successful issue, when this Bill was not included among the number. The Bill will be less objectionable in its modified form than as introduced, but we must persist in our opposition; our objection to the principle of the Bill remains. The first four clauses are not necessary, as there is a very easy method of getting rid of immoral clergymen by bringing in disestablishment. I find that the word "clergymen" in the first clause does not include the Archbishops or the Bishops, and therefore the Government do not propose to deal out the same measure to the higher officers of the Church as to the lower. Beyond this, there are offences which are not provided for in the Bill. The first four clauses, indeed, contain much that is contentious, and therefore I move the adjournment of the Debate.

(8.8.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS  (Carnarvonshire, Eifion) : The defence of the Government for this Amendment is that it is unnecessary to re-insert the word "suitable"—because the Education Department acts on the principle of the clause as it stood, and, therefore, the word is unnecessary. The Vice President of the Council says, it is wise to let well alone, and that the word "sufficient" in the mind of the Department includes the word "suitable." If that be so, we are

 *MR. CHANGING : I must protest against the Amendment even as amended. It is quite obvious the Amendment is made in the spirit of some words which fell from the noble Lord the Member for Darwen (Viscount Cranborne), namely, "any delay is of value." I protest against this Bill being used to enlarge the powers of voluntary schools with regard to the provision of public school accommodation. The words accepted by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Sheffield do not cover the issue. We all know that when this Bill is passed the present system will rapidly become a free school system. Ought we not to give a ready means of bringing the choice of schools within the reach of the people by the School Board system?
(10.10.)  MR. J. ELLIS : I believe that in regard to large towns such as the one I live in, if you group the denominational schools, such as the national schools, you will do away with subscriptions altogether. There is great diversity in the parish schools, and each parish takes special interest in its own school, and if you group the whole of the schools in a town together in pecuniary matters you must fail. Educationalists have wondered why national schools in large towns have not grouped themselves together for educational purposes. They have asked, "Why have they not grouped themselves together for the purpose of training the teachers? Why have they not grouped themselves together for the purpose of securing the advantages that the Board schools have?" Well, they have never done it, but when money is offered they always grasp at any scheme to make use of it for their own purposes. I believe that if they accept the money under the proposed grouping system they will fail, for when you draw from the whole locality for the support of the whole of the schools, local interest will die out, and the subscriptions will no longer come in. If the Amendment is passed I believe it will be fatal both to denominational, schools and denominationalism. It seems to me that it is too great an alteration to make in a Bill which has passed this House, gone up to the House of Lords, and come back here. We do not know, nor can we know, what the effect of the clause will be, but it certainly seems to me that it will be injurious to many Church schools, and ought not to be passed.
(10.19.)  MR. LLOYD - GEORGE  (Carnarvon,  : I wish to ask, if the Amendment has been moved in a  bonâ fide tu quoque
(10.55.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS : That would not be sufficient, because unless the Government were to take the initiative it would be impossible for any Member to raise the question of any particular scheme with the object of getting an expression of opinion in the House. I certainly think some closer definition than "neighbouring districts" is required.
(11.40.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS : I beg to move the insertion of the words "until the Education Department shall withdraw such approval" after "scheme,"

 THE CHAIRMAN : This is not a question of order to be decided by the Chair; it is a question for the Committee.
*(1.38.)  MR. MORTON [Cries of "Divide!"] : If there is any impatience on the other side, I must persist in my Motion for adjournment. I am willing to go on with the discussion of the Estimates, but I must not be interrupted. As to the audit of these accounts, the right hon. Gentleman told us the other day that there was a very rigid one carried out. It was on that statement that I based my question. He now says that it is an "adequate" audit. I do not say it is necessary that there should be a "rigid" audit, but it does appear

 MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS : I beg to support my hon. Friend (Mr. Lloyd-George) in the Motion he has made. The hon. Member for South Tyrone said that the schools in this country are denominational. The schools in Wales are only denominational in the sense that they are controlled by one denomination.
 THE CHAIRMAN : I would call the attention of the hon. Member to the fact that the Motion before the House is to report Progress.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member is disqualified from making that Motion, as he has already seconded a similar Motion.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : No difficulties have arisen in British Honduras, except in connection with the resignation of the unofficial Members of the Legislative Council, the grounds for which could not be stated within the limits of an answer. Their places have been provisionally filled by the appointment of gentlemen holding office in order that the Legislative Council may be duly constituted for the despatch of business. Her Majesty's Government were advised that this course was necessary and legal. As regards the third paragraph-of the question, it has been reported by telegraph that the Supreme Court has given such a decision; but the terms of, and reasons for, that decision have not yet been received. It is hoped that the differences between the late unofficial Members and the Government will be satisfactorily arranged; and Her Majesty's Government have no intention of holding any such inquiry as is suggested.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg-to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether any Government assistance will be afforded the Clonakilty and Rosscarbery Extension Railway; whether a deputation from the district in question, who went to Dublin and had an interview with the Under Secretary, Sir W. Ridgeway, were informed by him that their request would receive every consideration; whether a similar assurance was given by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at Skibbereen to another deputation on the same proposed railway; and whether, having regard to the benefit of the large fishing and agricultural interests in the district, the Government will give material assistance to the work?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if any further representations have been made to, or communications received from, the Cork and Bandon and West Cork Railway with regard to the proposed acceleration of the mails to Skibbereen, Bantry, and West Cork?
 DR. TANNER : The hon. Gentleman says he is opposed to denominational education. Trinity College, Dublin, is a standing protest against his remarks. I shall support the hon. Member for Carnarvon Boroughs.
 DR. TANNER : I think it would be reasonable to report Progress now.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid.) : There has been no obstruction. The hon. Member for Peterborough ought to have an answer, and we should have been spared a good deal of trouble if the Vice President of the Council had done his duty. I hope my hon. Friend will take a Division.
 DR. MACDONALD  (ROSS and Cromarty) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether any reduction is made to the Post Office when the mail steamers in the West Highlands are allowed to leave their routes for other than Post Office work in order to earn money for their owner?
 MR. W. H. CROSS  (Liverpool, West Derby) : The Bill was referred to a hybrid Committee at the special request of the opponents. The Committee went very fully into every matter, and the hon. Member for St. Pancras (Mr. T. H. Bolton), although invited to place his views before the Committee, did not appear, and no real opposition was offered to the Bill. I do not think the Committee could have done more than they did to satisfy the reasonable wishes of the opponents of the measure, and it does seem to me unreasonable that the hon. Member for Holmfirth (Mr. H. J. Wilson) should now, without a word of explanation, move the rejection of the Bill.
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : There was no evidence to show that the burning of the fire-bars of the  Sharpshooter Spanker Spanker
*(5.38.)  THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby (Sir W. Harcourt) spoke in one sense in language of moderation, but in another sense he used the language of absurd exaggeration when he said the House of Lords were determined to destroy and to hamstring this Bill. The subject is most difficult, and yet the right hon. Gentleman can only find objection to one Amendment in the Bill.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : I was under the impression that the right hon. Gentleman confined his objections to one Amendment. The hon. Member for Flintshire (Mr. S. Smith) tried to prove that the Bill would have the result of forcing Protestant children in large numbers into Roman Catholic schools. Well, Sir, whatever has been the practice in the last 20 years will continue to be the practice under this Bill. We cannot assent to the retention of a word which would have a different meaning in the Bill from that which has always been attached to it. I can show from an administrative point of view that it is impossible to accept this word "suitable" as it now stands. It is true that we did somewhat hastily assent to the insertion of the word, but, after having had time to consider what it means as it now stands, we have been forced to the conclusion that it must come out if the Bill is to be properly administered.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : My contention is that the word "suitable" in this Bill has a meaning entirely different from what it has in the original Act. In the original Act the word occurs in two clauses only, and those clauses relate to the supply of schools, and to the proceedings for the supply of schools, and in both refer to schools, which are not public elementary schools. I say that it has in practice never been applied to public elementary schools.
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : I assert, as a broad principle, that the Department has never applied the word suitable to public elementary schools. I assert that, as far as Roman Catholic schools are concerned, they are almost exclusively in Board school districts, and, therefore, the children have the option of going to another school. The word "suitable" has never been applied to an elementary school. All the evidence in the matter, both positive and negative, shows that the word "suitable" has never before been applied to public elementary schools, and we are now asked to give to the Act, by the insertion of the word, a meaning it never had before, and which meaning is not in the Act of 1870 or any other Act. Mr. Forster said that by "suitable" he meant schools "to which, in the absence of religious and other restrictions, parents could not reasonably object." If an Amendment moved to Clause 8 of the Education Bill of 1870 by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby (Sir W. Harcourt) had been agreed to, the word suitable would have been applicable to a public elementary school, but that Amendment was negatived. It would be impossible for the Education Department to carry out the Act under the procedure of that of 1870 if in the two statutes they have to administer there is the same word having a different meaning in each. In the interests of the Bill itself, as well as of those who will have to administer it, I hope the Lords' Amendment will be agreed to.
*(11.26.)  LORD G. HAMILTON : I think the right hon. Gentleman is somewhat unreasonable in the arguments he
 839
 *LORD G. HAMILTON : Sections 9 and 10 are most drastic in their operation, and the object of the Amendment is to call special attention to them. The Amendment meets, to a considerable extent, a good many of the arguments with regard to "suitability," because it enables the Education Department to take into consideration many of the points raised by hon. Gentlemen.
 MR. WEBB  (Waterford, W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he can hold out any hope that the engineering branch of the Telegraph Service will be placed on the same footing as the commercial branch as regards classification; and, if not, will he state the reason for withholding the concession?
 MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate from what date the increase of salary to the officers of the Fishery Board for Scotland, recently intimated by him, will take effect; and upon what principle the officers are in future to be divided into first and second class?
 MR. MUNDELLA : Has the Education Department never deducted vacancies in Catholic schools from the school accommodation of a district?
 MR. MUNDELLA : The word is in the original Act.
(4.55.)  MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : Sub-section 1 of Clause 4 gives power to the Department, if they are
 785 786
 MR. MUNDELLA : I do not find that school. Is it St. Wilfrid's the hon. Member means? The average attendance is 3,188, and there is accommodation for 7,224. In all these schools, therefore, the attendance is just half the accommodation. We know that Catholic schools will be among the first to be made free. Now, suppose these schools are made free and the Church of England schools are not made free, do the Government intend to compel the Church of England and Nonconformist children to attend the Roman Catholic schools? It is no use in such a case to say that the Protestant children would be protected by the Conscience Clause, because in Roman Catholic schools the emblems of their religion are to be found everywhere, and the atmosphere of those schools is pervaded by Roman Catholic teaching. The children there are constantly being taught by members of the Religious Orders. I ask the House, is it intended not to consider the suitability of these schools for Protestant children? In my experience the Education Department has always considered that Roman Catholic schools are not the proper schools for Protestant children. When I entered the Department I found that whenever the London School Board applied for additional schools in any district the number of vacant places in Catholic schools was always subtracted from the existing accommodation. Besides religious questions there are other questions of suitability. There is the question as to the quality of the schools, and it would be most unfair to compel a bright child to leave a better class fee school in order to make it attend a lower class free school. Then there is the question of site. Can you ask that infant children shall be taken to schools other than those for children of a larger growth? It is often the custom for the infant to be taken to school by the elder brother and sister. Are you going to say that children who have fee schools in their immediate neighbourhood shall be compelled
 787 Guardian status 788
 MR. MUNDELLA : I said if, after twice cutting short the Debate, they accepted the Amendment, it would seem to me equivalent to a breach of faith.
 MR. MUNDELLA : In order to remove any doubt, I beg to move to insert, after "in," in line 2, the word "free."
(8.54.)  MR. MUNDELLA : I want to point out that this is simply a dilatory Amendment. It has no other object in the world than to prevent free education coming into operation as soon as possible. It restricts the action and freedom of the Department. If it does not do so, why did not the right hon. Gentleman, when he introduced the Bill, insert words like it? Why is a public inquiry necessary? The Education Department has to find out if there is a sufficient supply of free school accommodation. If the Amendment is accepted, a year or two will be wasted in departmental and public inquiries before the Department will be in a position to require the establishment of a sufficient number of free elementary schools, and thus free education will be prevented from coming into operation as soon as it ought. The Amendment will work in this way. First, after the lapse of one year the Department will come to the conclusion that there is good ground for holding an inquiry. After that inquiry six months must elapse before an order can be issued requiring the provision of further free accommodation, and, instead of hon. Members being justified in wooing the constituencies by saying, "Remember the 1st September and see what we have given you," they will have to say, "Wait until the 1st September, 1893 or 1894, before you benefit by our policy." I appeal to the Government to support us in disagreeing with the Lords Amendment and in making the Bill what it was when it left this House. It surely is an extraordinary thing that the Government have to be compelled to support the principle of their own Bill.
(6.53.)  MR. MUNDELLA : I hope the House will not agree to this Amendment. The words proposed to be left out were inserted on the Motion of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green, with the object that no child attending an elementary school should be charged more than 6d. a week, bringing it up to the limit of 9d. I want to know why these words have been taken out and others substituted, which allow an average fee?
 MR. MUNDELLA : Ordinary; an ordinary fee is an average fee; and if the right hon. Gentleman considers what it means, he will find that in the higher standards higher fees can be charged. In the infant school you may have no charge, in the lower standards you may have a 3d. fee, and in the higher standards you may have a 9d. fee. It was not the right hon. Gentleman who accepted the Amendment in this House, but it was the Vice President himself, who, after a short discussion, volunteered to accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green. I ask him what has occurred since that this matter should be changed? We know what has happened elsewhere. In Scotland, for the first time during the last 20 years, the higher standards have fallen in number. Why? Because high fees are charged. I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether we are to have the Government paying £2,000,000 a year in freeing schools and still to have a continuance of these hardships, to use no stronger term? I therefore move to reject this Amendment, and to restore the clause to its original condition.
 MR. MUNDELLA : But a fee above 6d.?
 MR. MUNDELLA : Yes, but the Elementary Education Act says the fees shall not exceed 9d.; but this will be exceeded, taking into account the 10s. grant.
(7.18.)  MR. MUNDELLA : This is one of the most important Amendments made in the other House. As the Bill left this House it read thus:—
 "If at any time after the expiration of one year from the commencement of this Act it is represented to the Education Department that there is in any school district, or in any part of a school I district, an insufficient amount of public school accommodation without payment of fees for children over the age of three years and under the age of fifteen for whom such accommodation is desired, or where such accommodation is unsuitable for the wants of the population"— "Or where such accommodation is unsuitable for the wants of the population." 808 809
 MR. MUNDELLA : No; I asked the right hon. Gentleman to say whether it had not been the custom of the Department, in considering the question of supply of accommodation in elementary schools, to deduct the Roman Catholic supply as unsuitable.
 MR. MUNDELLA : It has in large towns.
 MR. MUNDELLA : That is an afterthought.
 MR. MUNDELLA : Nobody else has.
 MR. MUNDELLA : I submit that the Education Department ought to have power to abrogate a scheme. I cannot see how, if a new scheme is found unsatisfactory, the right hon. Gentleman or any other Vice President can fine a particular school for the bad working of a grouping scheme; it is impossible to withhold the whole grant. Surely the right hon. Gentleman ought to have power to abrogate a scheme if it is-found not to work well in practice.
 MR. MUNDELLA : In face of your ruling, Sir, I would ask the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he does not think it desirable to safeguard this clause by adding a proviso?
 MR. MUNDELLA : I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that we are as anxious as he is to make progress, and I think he knows that when this Bill was going through Committee of this House we facilitated it at every stage. We are anxious to promote grouping for educational purposes, and we have no objection at all to giving power for it, provided that the grouping is not a mere cover for obtaining money which ought not to be paid.
 MR. MUNDELLA : I am quite prepared to accept the right hon. Gentleman's proposal.
 MR. MUNDELLA : Leave out the 2nd sub-section, but insert the proviso.
 MR. MUNDELLA : We do not doubt the discretion of the Education Department, but we do feel very strongly that the increase of grant should not be allowed under the form of these Lords' Amendments. I shall have to appeal to the ruling of the Speaker on this point later on.
(9.40.)  MR. MUNDELLA : We want to know the effect of this clause—whether Section 19 of the Education Act is to be applied to it. If it is not applied, then this is simply a device for evading and defeating the 17s. 6d. limit. Now, the hon. Member for Leeds says that School Boards have this power of grouping—of taking the average; but he is quite mistaken. Every school stands upon its own separate account, the object being to
 828
(9.50.)  MR. MUNDELLA : In reply to the observations of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I ask the right hon. Gentleman does he intend, by an evasive and indirect method, to repeal Section 19 of the Act of 1876? He said a number of schools in different buildings might be regarded as one school; but does not the right hon. Gentleman sec that by taking the whole of the schools of one denomination in a town and combining their revenues, there may be a certain number of schools with a poor staff and low expenditure, which, if they stood alone, would come under the operation of the 17s. 6d. limit, but which, under the clause, could be starved in the interest of other schools. If the right hon. Gentleman will insert words requiring that each school shall receive a share of the expenditure, we shall be content. We want to secure that the grant shall not be so distributed that it goes to the benefit of the fee-paying schools, leaving the free schools inefficient.
 MR. MUNDELLA : The 2nd subsection of the clause not only admits the principle of grouping; it provides that—
 "Where two or more schools are under the same managers, the schools shall, if the managers so desire, he deemed for the purposes of this Act to he one school."
 MR. MUNDELLA : Not in the 2nd sub-section.
(1.35.)  MR. MUNDELLA : I would appeal to the hon. Member not to persist in his Motion. The House has spent a good deal of time on the question of education this Session. It was, I think, very unfair that the right hon. Baronet should have been called upon to make his educational statement at so advanced an hour of the night and at so late a period of the Session. I think it a very-bad precedent and one which should never be followed in the future. The House is jaded. For myself I feel that I have been here too long to-night, and I hope that we shall now allow the Government to take the Vote. There will be nothing gained by our delaying it.
(12.46.)  MR. MUNDELLA : I think it would be a cruel infliction on the Committee to detain them for long at this late hour of the night in criticising the speech of my right hon. Friend. It is due to him to say that there is no occasion for any apology on his part. Having regard to the long hours the right hon. Gentleman has been in the House and the laborious duties which have fallen on him, I think
 854 855
 MR. MUNDELLA : In America it is entirely a local contribution; not one penny is granted by the Central Government.
 MR. MUNDELLA : More than double.
(12.0.)  MR. MUNDELLA : I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman, before he makes his statement, whether the fee grant should be included with the result grant in one Vote. It seems to me that they should be separate. We shall want to discuss the grants separately, and to watch the progress under the application of the grant from year to year. I submit, as a question of order, they should be separate. It is true we can discuss the fee grant though joined with the result grant; but I think unless they are separated, we shall have a state of confusion worse confounded.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : I understood the hon. Member's reference to be to the Irish. Sunday Closing Act.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Undoubtedly. I adhere to the words I used, and which the hon. Member has quoted. I do not withdraw from what I said; but when the hon. Member asks me to promise Government time next Session, I can only say that such a pledge might have very wide-reaching consequences if the Bill should be opposed with the vigour it has met with in past years. I still think the Bill has a chance of passing in the hands of a private Member, but I will confer with my right hon. Friend and see if we cannot find means of putting an end to a disagreeable and troublesome state of things from a great measure such as this being included year after year in the Continuance Bill.
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The hon. Member is hardly acting fairly in this matter. I can quite understand his feeling that he ought to have an opportunity of expressing his views on the Bill. But what the Committee is asked to do now is not to pass the Bill, but to pass the formal Resolution which is necessary before we can take operative steps in the Bill as to money. We have determined to proceed in this way, because, in reply to hon. Members who objected to the Bill, I said I would alter the source from which this money is to be drawn. It was to have been advanced—not spent, but only in the first instance advanced—out of the Irish Church Surplus Funds, but I have now agreed that it shall be advanced from funds in charge of the Public Works Department in Ireland, and the hon. Member actually thinks that in spite of the concession we are making it is unreasonable to take the question at this hour of the night. I can assure the hon. Member we will not press on the Committee stage of the Bill at an unreasonable hour of the morning. We do not wish to deprive him of the opportunity
 871
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I said that if he opposed this formal stage, which only comes into existence in consequence of the concession I made to the opponents of the Bill, I snail regard it as obstruction.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Are we not discussing a Resolution the very pith of which is to prevent the money being lent out of the Irish Church Fund?
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I did not use the word "obstruction" in reference to the hon. Member, but simply to describe certain conduct which deserved that characterisation.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I must say I have been a good deal surprised and a good deal pained at many of the remarks which have been made this evening. I will not say I am pained by the speech of the hon. Member who has just sat down, but I am certainly very much surprised at it; for the change I made in the measure was to meet the views of the hon. Member and his friends, and I had reason to believe that it would meet with his support.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I hope the Motion will not be pressed. Hon. Members must see how important it is that we should finish this business to-night, because we cannot take two stages at one Sitting; and if the present stage be deferred until to-morrow, the next stage would have to be taken on a subsequent occasion, and the business would thus be prolonged.
(4.23.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : We have now had an opportunity of judging the merits of the case put forward by the opponents of this Bill. I will not discuss it now, but I shall be prepared at the proper time to show that this is not an attempt to promote Popery, as has been suggested, and that it will not effect a breach in the system of mixed education which now obtains in Ireland. I will further pledge myself to show that the Bill has been brought in in the interests of the Marlborough Street Training College, of which the hon. Member for South Tyrone seems to regard himself as the special guardian. But this is not an occasion on which to deal with these particular issues. I put down the Amendment transferring the duty of granting the loan from the Irish Church Surplus Fund to the Board of Works at the instance of that friend of denominational education the Member for North Camberwell. It was done to meet the objections of those opposed to the Bill, and that attempt to meet their wishes has been received in this way: that a Motion which is universally recognised as a formal Motion has been employed at a time when the House of Commons is utterly exhausted by its protracted labours, has been made use of to compel us to sit an indefinite period, and to force us—by a process of torture—to abandon the Bill. But I do not hold that I am obliged, after what has occurred, to adhere to this particular provision. I shall not ask the House to continue the
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I was an undergraduate at that time.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I must ask the hon. Member to be good enough to defer this question until to-morrow.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The gentleman mentioned does not appear to have attended at the Monasterevan Petty Sessions within the last five years, but there is a record of his having attended there previously. He resides in and attends the adjoining Potty Sessions. There is, however, at present a scarcity of Magistrates in the Monasterevan district owing to the death of a Magistrate, and the attendance of the gentleman referred to in that district is of public utility. There is no reason to believe that he attended in the interest of any litigant, nor is there any analogy between this case and the other one referred to.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have not yet been able to obtain the information that would enable me to answer the question, and therefore I must ask the hon. Member to repeat the question.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Commissioners of National Education report that at the recent results examination the certificate of the teacher mentioned showed that the total number of days in the results year on which book-keeping had been taught was 41, and that only one lesson weekly had been given. The Commissioners regarded this as obviously inadequate, and accordingly declined to pay results fees for the subject. In previous years this teacher had certified that book-keeping had been taught for a number of days, varying from 87 to 94, and on these representations results fees were paid. As regards the other extra branches, the teacher had certified that they had been taught for 88 days in the last results year at the rate of two lessons weekly. This was regarded by the Commissioners as an adequate provision, and results fees were accordingly paid. The Commissioners do not think the case one for re-consideration.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Assistant Commissioners of Intermediate Education report that the amount expended on administration by the Board in 1890 was £3,445 6s. 4d., and on "examinations" £7,702 9s. 3d. The amount expended on results fees was £8,894 3s., averaging about £2 17s. per head for each successful student.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Lord Lieutenant grants permission to import cattle from Great Britain into Ireland in all cases where, after due inquiry into the previous history of the cattle proposed to be imported and their surroundings, it is considered safe that such importation should take place. There has been no case, so far as I can ascertain, of refusal where the requisite conditions have been fulfilled.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : As I have not yet received the information, I must ask the hon. Member to defer the question.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The Lord Lieutenant undoubtedly has power to make such regulations regarding the im-
 774
 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E. : The Land Commissioners report that none of the applications referred to were lodged until October, 1889, and that they have long since been ruled upon as to security and title. I gather from the Commissioners' Report that if there has been any subsequent delay in completing the transactions it does not rest with them.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The Question now is the omission of the words "or more."
 *MR. SPEAKER : As I have said before, the question is one of inference and construction; but I have no hesitation in saying that if the 17s. 6d. limit will be exceeded in any particular school, the Lords have exceeded Privilege.
 *MR. SPEAKER : If the indirect effect of the Amendment will be such as is ascribed to it, the Amendment will be a breach of Privilege.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member is going beyond the question raised by the Lords Amendments, and is not entitled to make these observations.
 *MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! The hon. Member is not entitled to continue these remarks.
 *MR. SPEAKER : The right hon. Gentleman is so good a judge of order that I can add nothing to what he has said.
 MR. PICKARD  (York, W.R., Normanton) : For the Government to accept this Amendment will be equivalent to taking away with one hand what they give with the other. Too much regard is paid to the alterations made in another place. If it is intended to give free education to the country, then give it in the form we have decided it should be given after it has been thoroughly discussed.
 MR. PICKARD  (York, W.R., Normanton) : Are the Government prepared to give a day, or any portion of a day, for the discussion on the Eight Hours Bill?
 *SIR B. SAMUELSON  (Oxfordshire, Banbury) : It seems to me that the argument of my right hon. Friend the Vice President is difficult to follow. In 1870 we had not this Free Education Bill, and we limited the fees. Free-education is now to be the rule and payment the exception. But if you sanction the Lords' Amendment there will be no limit whatever, and you will have fees of 9d. and 1s. imposed. I am surprised that the Government should have assented to this Amendment after having accepted in this House the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green. If I may say so, these changes are calculated, to damage the Party of the Government outside very much indeed. If we wish to treat this matter from a Party point of view, it is the very best thing that could happen to us, but I should be sorry to take that ground. This Bill is introduced with the purpose of free education, and it is our duty to see that we are not diverted from that object. I hope the Government will still their way to disagreeing
 805
 *MR. C. S. PARKER : If so, why not word the Amendment so as to recognise that such is the practice of the Department?
*(7.45.)  MR. C. S. PARKER  (Perth) : I would suggest that it would be possible so to word the clause as to remove the objection of the right hon. Gentleman
 814 "If the Education Department are satisfied that in any school district there is insufficient accommodation, or that such accommodation is unsuitable to the wants of the population."
*(2.30.)  MR. C. S. PARKER : I certainly support the view that we should put off the Scotch Vote until to morrow. It is unprecedented that the Education Vote should be taken at such an hour as this, and without a full statement from the Lord Advocate, which we cannot expect at this time of night. As to taking other Votes, I may observe there are several to which Notices of opposition have been given, and Members giving those Notices have left the House, naturally supposing the Votes would be
 866
 *MR. RITCHIE : With regard to the London Public Health Bill, I may state at once that all the Lords' Amendments except two are of a verbal character, and on those two I do not think much discussion or opposition is likely to be raised.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : In January of the present year the Local Government Board received a complaint as to the supply of water in the parish of Otley. They communicated with the Rural Sanitary Authority, and were informed that the authority had directed that inquiry should be made by the Medical Officer of Health, and that it appeared from his Report that there was ground for complaint. They resolved that the owners should be required to provide a proper supply for the use of their tenants; and that if they failed to comply the authority would order the necessary works to be carried out, and charge the expenses upon them. This reply was communicated to the complainant, and the Board have received no further complaint in the matter. I have since been informed by the Sanitary Authority that they have called upon the owners of the properties in question to provide a proper supply of water. It is stated, in answer to my inquiries, that no deaths from fever at Otley are shown by the Registrar General's Reports during the two years ended 31st December last, but the authority are unable to furnish information as to the number of non-fatal cases of fever. The Local Government Board have not at present any facts showing that their intervention in the way of directing a local inquiry is necessary, but they will communicate further with the authority, with the view of obtaining more precise information as to the action which has been taken by them, and as to its results.
 *MR. RITCHIE : My attention has not been called to the refusal of any County Council to reimburse Quarter Sessions boroughs the cost of prosecutions at
 760
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's : I am afraid that I do not quite agree with my right hon. Friend. Having had some considerable experience in connection with Provisional Order Bills, I am of opinion that the period named by my right hon. Friend would be very inconvenient, and that it will be better to have regard to a particular period of the Session than to a holiday, which might
 752
 *MR. RITCHIE : The fixing of the date has reference rather to the end than to the beginning of the Session. The operation of the Allotments Act need not be prejudiced by fixing this date, because other proceedings with regard to Provisional Orders will not be altered.
 MR. SEALE-HAYNE  (Devon, Ashburton) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture why fees are demanded for inspection of the Tithe Reference Books; whether those books were prepared at public expense; and whether he will consider the desirability of permitting the examination of such books without charge, as is permitted in regard to documents at the Patent, the Record, and other public Offices?
 MR. CRILLY : I will put it down for to-morrow.
 MR. CRILLY  (Mayo, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord. Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that on Sunday, the 12th of July, Mr. D. Dunn, P.L.G., of Rostrevor, County Down, accompanied by another ratepayer of the same place, waited on Mr. Horner, J.P., to swear an information that if an Orange procession was permitted to pass through the village of Rostrevor on Monday, the 13th of July, a breach of the peace would most certainly follow, and that Mr. Horner, though bound as a Magistrate to receive this information, nevertheless refused, and declared his intention of leading the Orange procession in person; whether the information was subsequently sworn before Mr. Charles Leslie, J. P., and notice served on the police that the information had been laid; is he aware that these facts having been brought to the knowledge of Mr. Home, he insisted on the procession passing through Rostrevor when he headed it himself, and
 780
(11.15.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move to insert, after the word "district" in the second line of this clause, the words "being within the same poor law union." I think there should be some sort of limit to the word "neighbouring." I think the powers under this clause ought to be confined to the districts within a Poor Law Union, and surely that would be ample for the purposes of this Act. If the Government desire to make progress with this Bill, they will be willing to accept this Amendment. I do not think it possible they can contemplate the grouping together of two or three counties for educational purposes; and unless they
 837
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : Will the right hon. Gentleman be willing to agree that no School Board schools shall combine with voluntary schools?
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : Then on the understanding that the right hon. Gentleman will move the Amendment he has indicated, I ask leave to withdraw my Amendment.
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment.
(10.35.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I propose to omit the words "or more." It will be possible under the clause that two or more schools may be grouped together. Inasmuch as this grouping is not to be subjected to the proviso of Clause 6, it is desirable that this grouping should be restricted as much as possible. An unlimited power of grouping may permit the combination of schools in distant parts of the country where the public interests are widely distinct. There is nothing to prevent any number of schools in England and Wales combining under one scheme; there is nothing to prevent the trustees meeting in London
 834
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : Will the right hon. Gentleman say what limit the Government propose to put on the word "neighbouring," and also whether they will admit Board schools into the grouping arrangements?
(2.0.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by £1,000 as a protest against the appropriation of a sum of money to denominational education in this country. It is very remarkable that while some of the supporters of the Government are engaged in opposing denominational endowment of Roman Catholics in Ireland, they sanction the spending of Imperial money upon Episcopalian Colleges in this country.
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University : The judges appointed to consider the designs for the new South Kensington Buildings held their final meeting to-day, and unanimously chose out of the eight sets of designs submitted to them those which bore the motto "S. K. M." as, on the whole, the best. On opening the sealed envelopes, it appeared that S. K. M. was the motto adopted by Mr. Aston Webb, of Queen Anne's Gate. He is, therefore, the successful competitor. I shall cause his designs to be exhibited next week in the Tea Room of this House.
 MR. MADDEN : The Secretary to the Grand Jury of the County Londonderry states that the order of the Grand Jury made at Spring Assizes 1872 in regard to medical witnesses at inquests has been continued up to the present time. That order is to the effect that, in all cases in which medical witnesses are required at inquests, the Coroners shall in the first instance call in the dispensary doctors of the district in which the inquest is held. It appears that order was made after the power of the Grand Jury to do so was upheld by the Assize Judge, who ruled that such order was altogether right and reasonable, the dispensary doctor being, from his position and standing, the most suitable witness to call in in the first instance, and that the Coroners were bound to comply with this requirement and should not deviate from it without giving sufficient reason to the Grand Jury. Where the Coroners fail in satisfying the Grand Jury as to the reason for calling in a medical gentleman other than the dispensary doctor, the Grand Jury disallow the fee. The matter is one in no way under the control of the Executive Government.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University : I am afraid that I cannot give this Return in the exact form in which the hon. Member asks for it. I will communicate with the hon. Member
 754
 MR. MADDEN  said: My difficulty has reference to the correspondence between the Irish Office and the Lord Chancellor, which concerns two separate Departments of the Government.
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I do not wish to discuss this Motion, and so aid the hon. Member in his obstructive tactics, but I would urge the Leader of the House to divide against the proposal to report Progress.
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : Will the postponement of the Scotch Vote mean the loss of the £110,000, or will it only be held over to be disposed of in another year?
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been drawn to the following observations of Mr. Justice Wills at the Staffordshire Summer Assizes:—
 "It is the practice at most large gaols for the officials to go round a week before the trial and ask if prisoners desire to have any witnesses sent for. I wish this were customary at all gaols, as it is only right that it should be;"
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether a considerable number of clerks of the Savings Bank Department are still engaged on overtime, in addition to the clerks from other Government Departments, who since January have been working two and three hours a day, after completing a full day's work in their own offices; whether, notwithstanding the overtime at present being
 768
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : The effect of the Amendment of the Lords would be to bring the Bill back to substantially the form in which it originally was in this House, and on which the right hon. Gentleman accepted my Amendment. Whether the word is "average" or "ordinary," I think it will be clear that the mischief which I pointed out would equally accrue, namely, that the managers of schools would be able to charge differential rates or fees amounting to more than 6d. to children whom, for any reason, they might be unwilling to admit to their schools. Therefore, the argument now is as strong as it was when I moved the Amendment which was accepted by the right hon. Gentleman, and I hope he will resist this alteration.
(6.32.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle : There have been some very strong attacks made upon the Government in respect of this Amendment, and I think it right to state the circumstances in which we are placed. It is said we have done a very strong thing in having accepted an Amendment in this House and in afterwards supporting the alteration of that Amendment which has been made by the House of Lords. Is it really contended for a moment that because the Government have accepted an Amendment in this House that therefore the Lords are to be deprived of all power to alter it? Since the Amendment has been accepted in the Commons the Government have discovered that it makes a larger alteration in the measure than they intended. If the object of the Lords is, as alleged, to damage free education, they have gone about their work in a most extraordinary manner, because none of their Amendments will have that effect. The Government introduced the Bill with the distinct understanding that they wished to carry free education with the least possible disturbance of the existing system. Now they find the word "suitable" defended on the ground that it is the thin end of the wedge which would produce a disturbance of the religious settlement of 1870. ["No, no!"] It is perfectly clear, from the speeches that have been made by hon. Members opposite, that the retention of the word "suitable" would enable persons to raise religious difficulty in schools in which any religious teaching is given under the Conscience Clause. The Government determined, as I have said, to pass the Bill with the least possible disturbance of existing arrangements, and, therefore, they are consistent in resisting the change which they have discovered would be made by retaining the Amendment to which they assented in this House.
*(8.3.)  COLONEL HUGHES : I do not see that there is any ground for mistrust as to whether in the future the words inserted in the clause may be used in a manner contrary to the practice in the past. Of course, the ratepayers will complain if the schools are found to be unsuitable to the wants of the neighbourhood. I do not think so badly of the future Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Education Department as to suppose they will extend the construction of the word "suitable" in such a way as to declare that a Wesleyan school is not fit for a Baptist child, and so forth; and I have no doubt that if the word "suitable" is re-inserted, the Department will simply follow the practice it has observed all along.
 *COLONEL HUGHES : In a parish in which I am a lessee we have paid large sums of money to prevent a School Board being established, and we are prepared to pay more with that object in view. In 12 months we may not be able to complete the school
 824
(6.18.)  COLONEL HUGHES  (Woolwich) : I cannot understand why the word "suitable" should be struck out. The proposal to take it out leads me to suppose that the word "sufficient" will mean sufficient in number, whether suitable or not. We know perfectly well that there are many schools which ought not to be counted in reckoning the accommodation for a district. Sometimes a river may divide a district, and there may be an excess of accommodation on one side of
 798
*(6.5.)  MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I venture to say that no fair-minded man can interpret the 5th section of the Act of 1870 in the sense which the noble Lord has attempted. The deficiency to be supplied is a deficiency in suitable schools. How can it be argued, when we are supplying the deficiency, that the word does not equally apply to the schools which
 796
 MR. CHANNING  (Northampton, E.) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether the Education Department have entertained the application for annual grants to the new infants' school proposed to be opened by the managers of All Saints' Schools, at Wellingborough, in the Midland Road; whether he is aware that there are at present 700 vacant places in four schools in the immediate neighbourhood, including one Church of England, one Roman Catholic, and two Board schools; whether the Department has also refused to sanction the provision of a new Board school in the neighbourhood of the Northampton Road, at the west end of Wellingborough, although the inhabitants of that growing
 761
*(7.24.)  MR. CHANNING : As the words were inserted upon my motion, I may be allowed to add my appeal to the right hon. Gentleman, that he should allow them to remain. I think if he will consider the argument advanced by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby and by himself on a previous Amendment, he will see that that argument affords some ground in support of my proposal. The contention from the other side was that the word "suitable" did not run on the same lines as it does in the Act of 1870. Now, I contend that striking out these words and the word "unsuitable" in the 4th sub-section is really drawing the Bill on different lines to the Act of 1870 and the governing section of that Act. There the word "suitable" is used in regard to deficiencies of school accommodation, and here the words are applied exactly on the same lines, and with the same general reasoning behind them as in the Act of 1870. I remind the right hon. Gentleman, also, that there was considerable discussion on another Amendment which pressed the Government, perhaps, rather further in this direction, and it was on the suggestion of the Government—the First Lord of the Treasury, I think—that these words were accepted. This Amendment, of course, raises a much wider question than the previous one—a question of more vital importance, a question, I might say, of local rights, of local option in educational matters—the power of the inhabitants to make representation to the Department that the school accommodation is unsuitable, as well as insufficient. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will decide to retain the words.
(3.20.)  MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON  (Tower Hamlets, Stepney) : I hope that the Amendment will be withdrawn.
 748
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : We have thought of putting down the Indian Budget for Monday or Tuesday next; but it is impossible to come to any definite arrangement until we are enabled to see how we stand in regard to Supply.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : This is really a small point. There may be certain cases—they will be rare cases—in which ample free accommodation having been provided, then if school managers choose they may set up a school of this kind. How can it be said this is taking free education from the working classes In these circumstances, how can it be said that the Government are taking away with one hand what they have granted with the other? I protest against the insinuation. It seems to me as if hon. Members opposite, on the strength of the very small changes made in the Bill by the House of Lords, intend to start an electoral campaign in which they will indulge in even greater exaggerations than they utter in the House of Commons. We have had gross exaggeration as to the effect of the Amendment, and I must protest against the importance sought to be put upon a very small change. I do not attach very great importance to the change, but I do attach importance to these imputations of motives.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : A higher grade school may be established; but as there must first be sufficient free accommodation in the district, not a single working man need send his children to the school charging fees above 6d. My right hon. Friend will see that it is only when the Department is satisfied that sufficient accommodation is provided without the payment of fees—that is, if you have given free education in every district—that a school may be established charging a fee above 6d.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : Then what does local option mean? I hope the right hon. Gentleman will see the force of that argument, even if he does not agree with it. This point only refers to representations to be made to the Education Department. It does not fetter their hands. They will proceed as they have done hitherto. They will not allow unsuitable schools—schools that are unsuitable in the true old sense—to take the place of schools that are suitable. The right hon. Gentleman has dealt with difficulties which do not exist, and has ignored the real difficulty, which is the religious one.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I am very sorry that the right hon. Gentleman should give utterance to a misrepresentation of our motive. It has been pointed out by the hon. Member for Northamptonshire that these words will give an opportunity for a kind of religious local option. What does that mean? It means that, after the Bill has passed, a certain number of the ratepayers in every district will come together and say, "We will now make a representation to the Department that the public elementary schools in this district are unsuitable to the wants of the population. We do not consider them suitable, because they are denominational." In the interests of education and of peace, I think it would be most unwise that words which will give rise to such a religious difficulty should be left in the Bill. We have seen sufficient evidence of this.
*(7.40.)  MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman suggests that this is a fatal stab in the back to the whole system of compulsory free education. I am not quite sure whether the right hon. Gentleman has sufficiently looked at the wording of the clause. If he will do so, he will see that the clause only deals with the case of a representation being made to the Department.
 813
*(7.3.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I doubt if the hon. Member has read the clause, for his remarks, as have been the remarks of the other hon. Members, are entirely wide of the actual proposal. The effect of the clause is that in certain cases—not frequent cases I think—where ample provision has been made in the district for free education, after that we may have a graded school.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I should have thought hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite would have preferred that there should be a public inquiry in these matters. But my right hon. Friend does not attach an undue importance to the Amendment; and if it will facilitate matters, we will consent to a disagreement with the Lords Amendment. We shall do so with regret, because we consider a public inquiry is important. In any case, we trust it will not be imagined that the Amendment was made with any sinister object.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I said that was unnecessary, because it is already the practice of the Department, and we do not wish to interfere with the practice.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I do not know whether I may, by leave of the House, point out that the Education Department are to act under Sections 8 and 9 of the Act of 1870. It is clear, therefore, that the Department will take far more into consideration than simply to remove the mere insufficiency.
*(10.58.)  MR. GOSCHEN : In point of policy there is no objection to the grouping of Board schools, but there is a departmental difficulty in regard to rating which with voluntary schools does not arise. That is the only objection. There is no idea of including groups of schools over vast areas, and I think
 836
 MR. GOSCHEN : No, we cannot accept that.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I do not think the two sub-sections need necessarily be taken together; they may be considered as two Amendments.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman has not explained how this proposal would repeal the operation of the 17s. 6d. limit, if the schools were to be treated as under one management and as administratively and financially one school. I cannot see any objection, if you have a certain number of schools in different buildings but practically one school, to treating these as one school. That seemed to be desired by several hon. Members opposite when it was discussed in Committee, and I cannot see any objection unless the desire is to kill a school by its poverty. There is no objection to introduce words in the second part of the clause to require the approval of the Department if that is desired, but I do not understand there is any objection to the principle of grouping on its merits.
(10.15.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I would suggest that, if it will facilitate matters, the Government should propose to leave out the 2nd sub-section altogether, but we cannot accept the proviso of the right hon. Gentleman.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman is in error. There are many
 830
 MR. GOSCHEN : We will add words to the following effect: "Providing that schools provided by school boards shall not be grouped with other schools."
 MR. GOSCHEN : It will have to be presented as soon as Parliament meets.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : There is, as we know, a great disadvantage in the custom of bringing on educational schemes after midnight when they cannot be adequately discussed. I shall be quite prepared, if the desire is that Parliament should have early information, to present it in the form of a Return.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Agreed.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Under the circumstances, I must assent to the adjournment of the Debate.
 MR. GOSCHEN : If the right hon. Gentleman will not object to the combination this year, I will undertake that, if there is a general feeling in favour of that course, next year the Vote shall be divided as the right hon. Gentleman suggests.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I will not argue the point now, because I am bound to admit that after the Speaker's ruling the question requires grave consideration.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Yes, that is better.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The Board of Customs have declined to legalise the new quay at Stornoway until the Harbour Board fulfil their statutory obligation to provide proper watch-house and boat-house accommodation for the Customs officers. Such a demand is usual in the case of any harbour as soon as increase of trade or any other reason makes the want of such accommodation felt. At present there is no Customs boat-house at all in Stornoway, and the watch-house (which is not provided by the Harbour Board) is

 MR. GOSCHEN : The "Higher Division" spoken of in the Treasury Letter of 1884, referred to by the hon. Member, is a class of much greater extent than the very reduced Upper Division contemplated by the recent Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, who recommended the simple substitution of Second Division clerks for a large number of the Higher Division as it then existed, improving at the same time the pay of the Lower or Second Division. The Royal Commissioners have themselves considered the question of the promotion of Second Division clerks to the reduced Upper Division, and have expressed their opinions in the passage quoted by me in my answer to the hon. Member on June 29. In these circumstances, I cannot go beyond that answer, or give any such pledge as he desires.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The Treasury is never unwilling to postpone the payment of money to Local Authorities. If there is a general desire for the postponement on the part of Scotch Members, I think it may be done. I will consult with my noble Friend the Secretary for Scotland and the Lord Advocate on the matter.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I cannot give any undertaking upon this matter. So far as I am aware at present, Her Majesty's Government have no intention of opening up the question of Parliamentary reform next Session.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I am reluctant to withdraw the Clergy Discipline (Immorality) Bill until I am thoroughly convinced that the opposition to it is such that it will be absolutely impossible to pass it, but I venture to appeal to hon. Members—others may be able to appeal to them with greater force—not to allow a state of things to continue in which, as was stated yesterday, scandals may occur without any possibility of a remedy, when the passage of a few simple clauses might prevent a state of things which is to the interest neither of the Church nor the community.
 MR. GOSCHEN : In their regular order.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Bearing in mind the advanced period of the Session and the business still to be transacted, I doubt if the House would be prepared to discuss the question.
 MR. GOSCHEN : It will be impossible to give any of the small remaining part of the Session to the discussion of the Eight Hours Bill. With regard to the question of the right hon. Member for Derby (Sir W. Harcourt), arrangements must depend much on the progress made with business to-day and tomorrow. As soon as there is a prospect of Supply being speedily closed the Government will be better able to make arrangements for the convenience of the House with regard to the remaining business to be disposed of next week. I will ask the right hon. Gentleman to repeat his question to-morrow. As to the
 783 Hansard
 *MR. GOSCHEN : We will take the Votes to which there is no objection.
*(2.32.)  MR. GOSCHEN : Let us then proceed. I do not wish to force any Votes, and I accept the suggestion that we shall go on with Classes VI. and VII., excepting such as have Notices against them.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : We may be able to come to some arrangement. I would suggest that we should postpone this and the Irish Education Vote, and make some progress with the non-contentious Votes in Class V.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I must ask the Committee to consider what is the attitude of the hon. Member. In the first place, he objected to proceeding with the Vote. If we had opposed him he would have denounced us. We agreed to postpone the Vote, and suggested we should make progress with the Votes in Class V.; but, no, the hon. Member objects to our doing that. We will go as far as the Committee generally is willing to go, and no further.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I think we might first take this Vote.
 MR. GOSCHEN : It is not a question as to whether I shall be satisfied, but whether the Committee generally will be satisfied. I do not wish to take too many Votes to-night, but there is a great desire to make progress, and I think we might be allowed to proceed with the Estimates.
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : I had intended to ask the President of the Local Government Board if his attention has been called to the fact that the East London Waterworks Company, and other London Water Companies, have been charging on the new assessment, which came into force in April last,
 771
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : Is not that a violation of the pledge-given to the House when the question of contracts was under discussion?
 MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN  (Denbighshire, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that an addition has been
 759
 MR. G. OSBORNE MORGAN : In what order will the Civil Service Estimates be taken?
 *MR. G. BALFOUR : Sir, I understand your ruling to be that if this Amendment will have the effect of increasing the grant of any school it is a breach of Privilege. I wish to ask you whether, if that is only a contingent and indirect effect, the question of Privilege arises?
 *MR. G. W. BALFOUR : The object of the proviso was to prevent the same money constituting a claim to exceed the 17s. 6d. limit in two schools, but this cannot arise under the new clause. The 17s. 6d. grant cannot be obtained unless it is earned, and if it is earned the school cannot be in an inefficient condition.
*(9.35.)  MR. G. W. BALFOUR  (Leeds, Central) : I understand the proviso to Clause 5 is to guard against the danger of a double claim to exceed the 17s. 6d. limit being made in respect of the same sum of money. If schools were amalgamated under one management no such danger could arise, and if this new clause were inserted the result would be that voluntary schools might group themselves together, and when so grouped they would have similar advantages to those which Board schools have under a single Board management. It is true that by the grouping of schools there might be some cases where the 17s. 6d. grant would be exceeded where it is not exceeded now, but similar facilities are already possessed by the School Board. ["No, no!"] Yes; a School Board has at its disposal a fund received from the rates, which it can distribute among the various schools according to their necessities. This power will be obtained by voluntary schools in the same way as it is now possessed by Board schools.
 *COLONEL BLUNDELL  (Lancashire, S.W., Ince) : I venture to think that originally it did not matter whether the word was in or out, but I think the Government would be unwise to reinsert it in the Bill now that by the Debate of to-day it has been made an ambiguous term.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford : Fees have hitherto been demanded for the inspection of the Tithe Reference Books in order to cover the cost of an attendant capable of affording and explaining information respecting them, as well as for taking them out and replacing them. The tithe apportionments and maps were prepared in part at the public expense and in part at the expense of the landowners in the several parishes. It is not the case, I am informed, that the inspection of documents is permitted in the Patent, Record, and other Public Offices without fees, and, so far as I am at present informed, I am aware of no reason for remitting the fees in this case.
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S. E, Rugby) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to the remission of one-half of the sentence of imprisonment which was passed upon William Jarvis by the Ross Bench of Magistrates, advised by him in June last, upon statements made to him in memorials and letters from the neigh-
 758 inter alia
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the report in the  Standard 764
 MR. COBB : Do the Government intend to proceed with the Clergy Discipline Bill? According to  Hansard's 782
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E, Rugby) : I find on reference to  Hansard "The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian is deeply interested in the measure, and I hope he will soon be able to return to the House in order that we may be able to proceed with the Bill."
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S. E., Rugby) : May I ask whether the working of the Allotments Act will be prejudiced by fixing this date?
(5.48.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : We have been placed in a somewhat difficult position owing to the course pursued by the Government in the two Houses. In this House, nearly a month ago, after full discussion and at the request of many of their own friends, as well as of hon. Members on the other side of the House, they consented to insert the word "suitable" in the Bill, and yet almost directly afterwards they consented, without controversy, without Debate, and without Division, to an Amendment in the House of Lords striking it out. They then come down to the House of Commons at the very end of the Session, when a large number
 793
 MR. H. H. FOWLER : The Department in determining the amount of public school accommodation required in a district has under the Act to take every school into consideration, and, therefore, I contend that the clause in the Act of 1870 does apply to public elementary schools. This is not a question of providing accommodation, but of conferring a benefit on the individual parent. You say to the working man: "You shall have the benefit of free education;" and immediately afterwards yon say: "If you will not send your child to occupy a vacant place in a school to which you object, you shall be deprived of the benefits of free education." My right hon. Friend put the case very strongly with regard to Protestants being forced in to
 794
*(7.30.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : I cannot but feel disppointed with the
 811 crux bonâ fide "If at any time after the expiration of one year from the commencement of this Act it is represented to the Education Department that there is in any school district, or any part of a school district, an insufficient amount of public school accommodation without payment of fees for children over three and under fifteen years of age, for whom such accommodation is desired, or that such accommodation is unsuitable for the wants of the population," &c— 812
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : This is a purely drafting Amendment, and I am not going to criticise it; but I must say I prefer the original wording.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : I should like to ask you, Sir, whether this Amendment is not outside the scope of the Bill? This Bill was founded on a Resolution of this House to supply public money for the purpose of making a fee grant. The Government resisted any discussion in respect to the 17s. 6d. limit, and any other question affecting the Act of 1870, on the ground that an Amendment of the Act of 1870 was outside the purview of this Bill. This is an Amendment to settle such controversies as those which have arisen at York and Salisbury, with which this Bill has nothing to do.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : I quite agree with the hon. Member for Woolwich (Colonel Hughes) that if the clause was necessary to carry out his views there would be a great deal to be said in favour of it. But there is to be an expiration of 12 months; then there is to be an inquiry, and then the Education Department are to direct that the deficiency shall be supplied. This is a provision which is totally outside the Bill. I shall certainly divide against the clause.
*(9.30.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : This is an entirely new clause. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will give us some explanation of it?
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : What we ask is the course the right hon. Gentleman means to take in reference to both subsections. I can quite understand Subsection 1 as carrying out the principle of grouping, but Sub-section 2 contains a new principle, where two or more schools are under one management they shall, at the desire of the managers, be deemed one school, so that the schools of one denomination in a town may all be put under one management and be treated as one school, though there may be degrees of fees, high and low, and the grant applied to the whole as one school. The effect would be unjust, and I think before we pass from Sub-section I we ought to know what the Government propose to do with Sub-section 2.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : The hon. Member for Leeds says the proviso was put in to prevent the fee grant being given twice over, but with all respect to him, I think he is mistaken. The object is to prevent the danger that might arise from the fee grant being made a common fund. If the fee grant to school A amounts to £50, and the fee grant to school B £100, and the grant is shared, then school A may receive £75 instead of £50. I protest against this attempt of the Government to abolish indirectly the 17s. 6d. limit. The Government have declared over and over again they would allow no interference with that limit, and yet now they are proposing to group schools together for the avowed purpose of doing away with the limit.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : In an indirect way the grant of public money will be increased to certain classes of schools, although there is no Resolution of the House on which such a grant can be made. By this combination of schools—it may be schools in quite different parts of the country—the whole purpose of the Act will be evaded.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : I fully appreciate the difficulty of the right hon. Gentleman's position. He is Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, therefore, bound to carefully guard the financial operation of the Bill, and at present he is leader of the House and bound to guard its privileges to the fullest extent. I do not think it would be right to press for a decision now, and, therefore, I beg to move that the Debate be now adjourned. The Government will, therefore, have an opportunity of considering their position with reference to what is a very serious invasion of the privileges of this House.
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER : I now beg to ask you, Sir, whether it is competent for the House of Lords to insert an Amendment of this character, the effect of which will be to increase the grant under the Act of 1870?
*(11.22.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : I have now to move an Amendment which raises the whole effect of this clause, and if accepted it will prevent my submitting a point of order as to whether it is competent for the House of Lords to insert an Amendment authorising a grant of money. I think it will be admitted that the effect of the clause is to do away with the 17s. 6d. limit contained in the 19th section of the Elementary Education Act of 1871. [ Cries of
 SIR H. JAMES  (Bury, Lancashire) : When do the Government propose to take the Lords' Amendments to the Factories and Workshops Bill?
(3.30.)  SIR H. JAMES  (Bury, Lancashire) : Like many other Members present, all I know of the Bill is that it has passed the Second Reading, and that a very strong Committee has reported in its favour. I admit that on some occasions the House might properly and rightly overrule the
 750
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have seen the paragraph quoted from the newspapers as to the prize fight between Smith and Pritchard. The police were not able to effect an entrance in time to be present at the encounter, which only lasted a few minutes, but they inform me that, having entered and seen both the pugilists immediately afterwards, the only injury they observed was a small swelling on Pritchard's face. They saw a pair of ordinary 4oz. gloves, and have no evidence to rebut the statement made by all concerned that these were used in the encounter. The names of the chief persons taking part in the proceedings appear to be correctly given in the newspapers. The law as to what constitutes an illegal fight has been laid down in the superior Courts. If evidence were forthcoming that the fight was of an illegal character, I should not hesitate to direct proceedings, whether it took place with or without gloves.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am not quite sure that I appreciate the exact force of the expression "knocked out of time." I have not the special knowledge of the subject that is possessed by the hon. Gentleman opposite. I take it that the distinction is this: If two men for delight or for exercise, or to test their skill,' choose to box with or without gloves, it is not an illegal proceeding. If, on the other hand, they fight for the purpose of doing each other serious injury in order that one might be exhausted—that is, knocked out of time—the case is different.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am afraid I must decline to answer a question of possible law.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARIMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : There is no general order on the subject in local prisons. In convict prisons officers are permitted to wear plain clothes when on leave of absence, but on no other occasion.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I do not think the doing it for money has the slightest influence upon the question at all.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have only seen a newspaper account of the case against James Green, in which there is nothing to indicate that the learned Judge said or implied anything by way of censure on the Ross Bench. I will, however, make inquiry of the Judge on this-point. It must not be understood that, because I advised a remission of part of the sentence in the case of Jarvis, I intended in any way to find fault with the Bench. It was a question of the amount of punishment for an admitted offence, as to which there can properly be a difference of opinion. It is no part of my duty to inquire into the ages and professions of gentlemen holding commissions of the peace; and, with regard to the Clerk to the Justices, I have nothing to add to the answer which I gave on the 27th of April.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Yes, Sir; I have made inquiry, and am informed that in neither case is the ground part of the churchyard. These are private burial grounds governed by the terms of the deed of Trust. The Act of 1880 does not apply to such grounds, and it was not the intention of Parliament to interfere with private Trusts of this character.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have not seen the observations of the learned Judge; but the practice which he commends seems to me to be a good one, and I have no objection to giving an order for its general adoption.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I am aware of no statutory restriction preventing a magistrate's clerk or his partner acting as solicitor to a Licensed Victuallers' Association.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : I am aware of only one route on which the mail steamer is allowed under special circumstances to make an occasional deviation from her course, and in that case the deviation is a condition of the contract, and the Postal Service does not suffer. Therefore no reduction of payment by the Post Office is made.
 *MR. RAIKES : At the present time very few clerks of the Savings Bank Department and no clerks belonging to other Government Departments are being employed there on overtime. Since the 1st of January last seven clerks of the Second Division have been transferred from the Savings Bank to other branches-of the Post Office, three on their own applications, and the others in the interests of the Service. At the present moment no other transfers are in contemplation.
 *MR. RAIKES : The engineering branch performs work of a special character, and there docs not appear to be any reason for making its classification uniform with that of another branch. But proposals affecting the pay of certain classes of engineering officers have been submitted to the Treasury, and are now receiving their Lordships' careful consideration.
 MR. RAIKES : The arrangements are practically complete so far as the Post Office is concerned, and the service might begin on the 1st prox. But the draft contract is still before the Railway Companies for examination, and until it is returned by them, approved, I am not in a position to give a definite answer.
 MR. RAIKES : The telegraph office at the railway station at Nobber was closed on the 28th September, 1886, because the Railway Company were not in a position to carry on the business any longer. I shall be glad to inquire whether the circumstances have changed, and I will let the hon. Member know the result.
 MR. RAIKES : The conveyance of the Belfast mails over the loop line has hitherto been purely experimental, and at the suggestion of the Railway Companies interested. So long as a fortnight ago I inquired of the companies on what terms they would enter upon a permanent arrangement. Their reply, naming what appears to me an excessive payment, only reached my hands an hour or two ago. The hon. Member will see that it is out of the question that I can make any definite arrangement without consideration. Meanwhile, the mails are being efficiently carried as formerly by road over a distance less than a mile now traversed by the railway as quick or even quicker than by rail.
 MR. RAIKES : If the companies approach me in a reasonable spirit I am prepared to enter into an arrangement with them.
 *MR. RAIKES : I am not aware of the arrangements to which the hon. Member refers, and there has not been sufficient notice of the question to enable me to receive a reply to the inquiry which I have made on the subject. The hon. Member may rest assured, however, that I will take whatever steps may be necessary to provide for the efficient discharge of the service without inflicting undue hardship upon the staff.
 *MR. RAIKES : No. Sir. But I am quite prepared to consider a reasonable proposal if the company will make one.
 MR. H. BYRON REED  (Bradford, E.) : I shall resist to the utmost this attempt to endow the Church of Rome. On most occasions I support the policy of the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland, but I must tell him that there are many of his best friends in England who will resist to the utmost of their power this attempt at bargaining with the Church of Rome. He may seek to conciliate the Church of Rome; and I imagine that in his attempt to buy them he will be successful, but, in the long run, he will lose his best friends, and will find that the Church of Rome will sell him—
 MR. H. BYRON REED : Then, Sir, all I will say is that at such an hour as this contentious business should not have been taken.
 MR. H. BYRON REED : I beg to second the Motion.
 MR. H. BYRON REED : I am inclined to think that, in the long run, the right hon. Gentleman will find his old allies are his best friends, and I hope, therefore, he will not press this Bill against their wishes.
(4.1.)  MR. H. BYRON REED : I do not propose to enter into the merits or the demerits of this question at this hour of the morning. I merely rise to move that you, Mr. Courtney, do report Progress and ask leave to sit again.
*(10.50.)  MR. ROBY : I beg to move as an Amendment to the same clause to omit in line 2 the word "neighbouring," and to substitute "district" for "districts." The words as they stand are far too wide and indefinite, and a limit ought to be imposed. "Neighbouring districts" may extend from one to the other all across England.
 *MR. ROBY : I do not know what the object of the Amendment is. It is already provided that a School Board is only to be formed when the school accommodation that is wanted is not being supplied with due despatch.
 *MR. ROBY : I do not quite understand the Vice President's argument. If the Department think fit they can order a public inquiry. How many of these public inquiries are we to have? Why make this inquiry compulsory? It will assuredly lead to delay.
 *MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : The question of the use of the word "suitable" has given rise to a good deal of contention as to the mode in which it may be applied. In my opinion, there would be no difficulty in using it in any sense in which it ought to be used for the purpose of carrying out the intentions of this measure, and I think the Government are pressing much too strongly the argument they have used
 818
 MR. H. J. WILSON : It is all very well to repudiate the assertion, but the fact remains that no other interpretation can be put upon the words he used. Let that fact remain; it is an important fact, and one which the country will take note of. As to the argument of the First Lord of the Admiralty, if all the other schools are full, what does it matter whether it is a School Board district or not, if the Department refuses to act? There may be no accommodation in one part of a district, and apart from whether a river or a mountain divides it, the question remains whether the children of that portion of the district are to be left to travel long distances to find school accommodation. I am rather astonished that the Government should yield in this way, and we shall not only make the most earnest possible protest now, but we shall take care that the country understands the nature of the transaction.
(6.23.)  MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : When the argument was used by my hon. Friend that Roman Catholic children might be forced into Protestant schools and Protestant children into Roman Catholic schools, the Vice President interposed in a way which showed that he contemplated a
 799
 MR. H. J. WILSON  (York, W.R., Holmfirth) : I have the greatest objection to religious endowments of every kind, and I certainly must protest against entering upon a new one at this time of night.
 MR. H. J. WILSON : I wish to ask the Vice President of the Council a question with reference to Inspectors being promoted from the ranks of schoolmasters. Although when I raised this question a year ago, I got a promise that the claims of schoolmasters to these appointments should have favourable consideration, I believe no such appointment has been made.
 MR. H. J. WILSON : I feel very strongly on the question of the promotion of school teachers. The right hon. Gentleman says there has been no vacancy in the Inspectorate. According to the Estimates there were 67 Inspectors last year, while there are only 65 now. Are there not two vanancies to be filled up? Again, there were 42 sub-Inspectors last year, while there are 45 now. Are the sub-Inspectors being made to do the work of the Inspectors, and are promotions to the superior ranks avoided?
 MR. E. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN  (Rochester) : May I ask whether, if proper gloves were used, these boxing matches are not perfectly legitimate?
(3.10)  MR. CHILDERS  (Edinburgh, S.) : I hope the Amendment will not be pressed, as it is a somewhat unusual coarse to move the rejection of a Bill without assigning any reasons for the Motion. Perhaps, under the circumstances, I had better say a word as to what the Bill does, and why it is considered to be necessary. It is a Bill which after having received discussion in the House was referred to a Select Committee of five members—three selected in the usual way and two nominated by the Committee of Selection. I was one of the two nominated by the Committee of Selection, and I can safely say that both of us entered the Committee with perfectly open minds. Neither of us took part in the Division upon the second reading, and neither of us had the slightest bias either one way or the other. The fact of the matter is, that the existing Church has come to be altogether unsuited to the wants of the parish, and it has been thought desirable to dispose of the site and erect another Church in the centre of the parish where it will better meet the necessities of the locality. I may add that the Bill is unanimously
 747
(9.45.)  MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : The object of the Bill when introduced was that no fees in any fee-paying school should charge more than 9d., 3d. being paid by the grant; but by the amalgamation of a number of schools, though in some schools the fee may exceed 6d., the average of the whole number may bring them within the 17s. 6d. limit. To prevent this, I move that Sub-section A shall be subject to the proviso at the end of Clause 6 of the new Bill:—
 "Provided that the fee grant received by each school in the first instance shall alone count as income of such school for the purposes of this Act and of Section 19 of the Elementary Education Act, 1876."
 MR. CALDWELL : There is a matter to raise in reference to the Scottish Univerities Commission. I do not oppose any Vote without reason.
 MR. CALDWELL : This Vote includes the Scottish Universities Commission, upon which there is something to be said. I now move to report Progress.
 MR. CALDWELL : This Vote is in its order, and I know a number of Members have left on the understanding that it was impossible that this Education Vote could be finished to-night, and the Votes in Class V. taken. I am ready to go on with the Vote, but if it is not proceeded with, I do not think the Government should ask us to take the Votes in Class V.
(2.22.)  MR. CALDWELL : This is one of the most important of the Scotch Votes, and I am surprised we should be asked to take it at this hour of the morning. On every previous occasion when this Vote has been taken we have had a statement made by the Minister in charge of it. When the Government boast of having carried legislation, the people of Scotland will realise that it has been carried at the expense of attention to the affairs of Scotland. The attempt to force through this Vote shows the people of Scotland the absolute impossibility of their country's affairs being conducted by the Imperial Parliament. The Education Vote is the only Vote which is really of interest to

 DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that Mrs. Doherty, wife of Pat Doherty, on the Tenalick Estate of Lord

 MR. FLYNN : I hope the Government will persevere with the measure.
 MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N.) : The hon. Member has referred to some Act, but as to what Act it is he has left us in ignorance.
 MR. LEAHY  (Kildare, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that Mr. J. E. Medlicott, J.P., Dunmurrey, County Kildare, attended at Monasterevan Petty Sessions on the 17th instant, and adjudicated upon a case in which his friend Forbes Johnston, Esq., Q.C., was plaintiff, and John Hannon, defendant, and which was for the recovery of possession of the latter's holding at Laghill, Monasterevan, County Kildare; if Monasterevan is one of the Petty Sessions Courts that Mr. Medlicott attends, when he last attended, and how often within the last five years; and will the Government deal with Mr. Medlicott in the same way as they did with Mr. James Byrne, Wallston Castle, Mallow, County Cork?
 MR. RENTOUL  (Down, E.) : The only reason the Ulster Unionist Members are opposing this is because they regard it as the thin end of the wedge of the endowment of denominational education in Ireland.
 THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute : In reply to the first part of the question, I have to inform the hon. Member that increase of pay is-to date from the 1st instant; and, in reply to the latter part, that the principle on which it is proposed to distinguish the first from the second class of officers is that the former will be composed of those who perform more arduous or more important duties.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : It is proposed to give to the County Councils complete discretion as to the mode of relieving rates; and it is presumed that this discretion will be exercised in the interests of the general body of ratepayers, by whom they are elected. It would, of course, be competent for them to follow the suggestion of the hon. and learned Gentleman, or to adopt any other application of the grant; but this is merely another way of saying that we propose to give an unfettered discretion to the popularly elected local administrative bodies.
 MR. J. ROWLANDS : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether his attention has been drawn to the report of a meeting of the Court of Aldermen of the City of London, held on the 28th instant, at which the Gardeners' Company was granted a livery, not exceeding 60 in number, who will become electors of the City of London; and whether Her Majesty's Government will take the necessary steps by legislation to prevent the manufacture of faggot votes?
 MR. J. ROWLANDS : Were not Messrs. Ross struck off the list of contractors because the material they used for their articles was not of the right quality?
 MR. J. ROWLANDS  (Finsbury, E.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether an order has been given from the War Office to Messrs. Hebbert and Co., of James Street, Haymarket, S.W., for 10,000 pouches and belts for telegraph messengers; if so, whether the contract permits Messrs. Ross & Co., of Grange Mills, Bermondsey, who were struck off the list of contractors, to cut and supply leather for the order; and if the factory clause is inserted in the above contract?
 MR. J. ROWLANDS : Would it be illegal for Messrs. Ross to deal in any way with the material they supply in cutting out the articles, seeing that they have been struck off the list of contractors?
 MR. ADDISON  (Ashton-under-Lyne) : I have listened to the speeches made in which hon. Members have declared that this is an attack on the system of free education; but this remains a Free Education Bill, because for every child between the ages of 3 and 15 may be demanded a free place in a school; and this being conceded, if parents are willing to pay a high fee for a better form of elementary education in a higher grade school, why should they not be allowed to do so? How can this in any way affect the fact that those who desire free education can get it?
(7.47.)  MR. ADDISON : I do not consider the reproach addressed to me by the right hon. Member for Sheffield (Mr. Mundella) to be well deserved, because while it is quite true that when the matter was under discussion I added my voice to urge the Government to accept these words, I did so on the ground that they seemed to be harmless and unobjectionable. But after reading what has been said, and after having heard the Debate to-night, it is plain to me that to some extent I was deceived by the ingenuity of hon. Gentlemen who brought forward the Amendment. Now it appears that this Bill, which is ostensibly a Bill for free education, is to be made a Bill for the establishment of universal School Boards. According to the argument of the right hon. Gentleman opposite, what is the meaning of the word "suitable"? Something was faintly said about its being suitable topographically—that is to say, suitable as to distance; but I should have thought that that would have been covered by the word "sufficient." It is absurd to say that a school is sufficient which is too far off for the children to attend it. The education authorities have themselves said that every public elementary school shall be

 MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I beg to ask the hon. Member for Penrith (Mr. J. W. Lowther) whether the Charity Commissioners have yet received a reply from the Governors of St. Paul's School to the allegations made by members of the Fulham Vestry and by the late Mr. James Beal; and whether he will communicate its purport to the House?
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I support the Motion, because we have never yet discussed this Bill, and because we should do so at an hour when we can get reports of our proceedings in the newspapers to awaken, the conscience of England to the real purport of the Bill. I do not think it
 873
 MR. KELLY : I desire to point out that the Synod of the Church of Dublin never made any such proposal as has been stated. What is all this anxiety about? Why is it thought necessary to declare that grown up Catholics cannot go to mixed training colleges without enormous danger to their principles? Again, what is it the right hon. Gentleman is going to pay for? Is it the buildings, and everything on the premises? I may be told that the money is only going to be lent, but there is no real security; the only security will have to be taken from the money necessary for the support of the colleges, and if that security is enforced, then the colleges will have to be shut up. It is absurd to look at this otherwise than as a gift, and I say it is a gift at the thought of which a large proportion of the English people will shudder. The people of England are strongly Protestant; they have no wish to attack their fellow Catholic subjects; they have no desire to inflict pain upon their

 *MR. LOGAN  (Leicester, Harborough) : The arguments which have been used by those who have opposed the Lords Amendments appear to me to be unanswerable, and I do not intend to repeat them. I might have rested content to register yet another silent vote against these Amendments, but my duty and the trust imposed on me by my constituency bid me to protest in the most solemn manner against the other House vetoing a decision deliberately arrived at by the chosen Representatives of the people; and while, in one sense, I welcome these Amendments as helping us to educate the masses of the people as to the folly of a free people allowing any body of men by the mere accident of birth to—
 *MR. LOGAN : If you had not stopped me, Sir, I should simply have said—
 COLONEL NOLAN : I hope the hon. Member for Carnarvon will withdraw his Motion. That Motion is based on the fact that a certain amount of opposition was raised to the Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill the other day. I cannot stretch my conscience to vote against denominational education in England, because we are badly treated on that point in Ireland.
 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : If the Government get this Vote, will they consent to report Progress? As the right hon. Gentleman will see, most of the reporters have withdrawn. If the Government get this Vote will the Chancellor of the Exchequer be satisfied?
 MR. PINKERTON  (Galway) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether the Grand Jury of any county have power to select medical witnesses for inquests and compel the Coroner to call in those appointed by them, and, in the event of the Coroner not complying with their instructions, to disallow the fee (£1 1s.) if the Coroner calls in any other registered practitioner residing in the district; whether he is aware that, in the County of Londonderry, the Grand Jury cancels the Coroner's application for the fee of £1 1s. which has been paid by the Coroner to the medical witness at the time of the inquest, if he does not call in the dispensary doctor as such witness; and whether instructions will be given to reimburse the Coroners for the loss and expenses they have thus sustained?
*(5.58.)  MR. TALBOT  (Oxford University) : The right hon. Gentleman a little departed from the general moderation with which he has discussed the Amendment when he referred to the noble Lord who is supposed to be responsible for it. It is only fair to Lord Sandford to say that he did not challenge a Division on the Second Reading of this Bill, and that all his Amendments were aimed at making the Bill more workable. If hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite will look into this matter they will see that the insertion of this word, in this particular place, would be the "letting out of strife." The Department might be constantly called upon to say whether, in their judgment, these free places are suitable. The word "suitable" is mainly looked upon from the religious point of view. In other words, it would mean that in every place where there was a feeling that a school did not exactly represent all the religious convictions of the inhabitants of that district, representations might be made to the Government and the Education Department to undertake the very perilous duty of inquiring into these very difficult and delicate matters. It is hardly worthy of right hon. Gentlemen opposite to talk of Protestant children being forced into Roman Catholic schools; the idea is preposterous, and the common sense of the
 795 ipso facto
 *MR. TALBOT : There is no intention by this Amendment to delay the provision of free school accommodation. What is intended is that where the inhabitants of a district prefer the existing voluntary system, they should be enabled to provide free accommodation under that system.
 *MR. TALBOT : But what will be done if Parliament is not sitting? It is not desirable that these arrangements should be delayed because they happen to be made in the Parliamentary Recess.
(12.54.)  MR. TALBOT : I cannot allow this Debate to close without congratulating my right hon. Friend on the interesting statement he has made under such adverse circumstances. There is one point which I wish to press upon the attention of my right hon. Friend. Much has been done in the way of securing pensions for the older class of teachers, but there is a small body of them—deserving, although small—who having entered the profession as pupil teachers between 1846 and 1851, now find themselves in some cases shut out from a claim to these pensions because they went to Training Colleges, and so deferred the period of their actual work. If they had begun to teach with less preparation, they would have had their claims recognised at once. It does not seem to be fair that they should be lost because they devoted longer time to their preparation. The right hon. Gentleman opposite was, I think, a little impatient in the observations he has thought fit to make. He should remember that there will necessarily be some deficiency in any system that is adopted, and also that the large sum of money it is proposed to vote, and which is greater than that which is paid by any other country in the world for educational purposes, might be enormously increased
 856
(7.55.)  MR. POWELL J. WILLIAMS : The Chancellor of the Exchequer has put it that these words apply only to the representations which are made by the public to the Department upon the matter of the suitability of the accommodation. At the same time, when he tells us that the Department, acting for themselves without the interference of the public, are accustomed to take into account whether the accommodation is suitable, I should have thought, if the Department of its own motion did that, it might allow the public to do it of their own motion when acting without the Department. The fact is, we are giving a very large amount of money for the purpose of education without representative control, and everything that tends to give the persons interested in it a full right to appeal upon every point by which they are affected be desirable to retain. Therefore, I am in favour of the retention of the words in the Bill which the House of Lords have omitted.
(6.28.)  MR. POWELL J. WILLIAMS  (Birmingham, S.) : As a Liberal Unionist Member, I regret the course which the Government have adopted in this matter. The argument of the noble Lord was that simply because this word "suitable" might not have precisely the meaning which it bears in other Acts of Parliament, therefore it ought not to be inserted. But it seems to me that if the meaning which the word would bear in this clause is the proper meaning, then it ought to be retained for the reasons which prompted the House of Commons to insert it. If you look into the case closely, there cannot be any real objection to the retaining of the word "suitable," because accommodation is not accommodation in the proper sense unless it be suitable. Accommodation in a Jewish school is not accommodation in the real sense for Christian children. Accommodation in a Roman Catholic school is not accommodation in the real sense for Protestant children; and, therefore, I venture to think that the word "suitable" as inserted by this House is most important, and that the argument of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton is absolutely unanswerable. Unless it is

 MR. ROWNTREE : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether magistrates' clerks or their partners are allowed to act as solicitors to any Licensed Victuallers' Association?
 MR. ROWNTREE : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether he is aware that the school district of Broom-field, in the County of Somerset, had in 1881 a population of 420, and has now a population of about 380; whether the small population grant (Art. 104 of the present Code) has been paid to the national school in this district since the year 1886; and, if so, for what years; and by what legal authority has this grant been paid to a school in a district whose population exceeds 300?
 MR. ROWNTREE  (Scarborough) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board if his attention has been called to the refusal of certain County Councils to reimburse Quarter Sessions boroughs the costs of prosecutions at Assizes of prisoners committed for trial from such boroughs; and whether, inasmuch as Section 35 of "The Local Government Act, 1888," makes all costs of such prosecutions (formerly reimbursed from Her Majesty's Treasury) a charge upon the County Fund, the Government will take such steps as may be necessary to prevent Quarter Sessions boroughs from being placed in a worse financial position in this matter than they were in before the passing of "The Local Government Act, 1888," and of the grants in aid of local taxation?
 MR. JUSTIN M'CARTHY  (Londonderry) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he can toll the House the reason why the Lord Lieutenant has lately refused permission for the importation of cattle into Ireland from a district of Scotland which is not scheduled, and from which the cattle could be moved anywhere throughout England, Scotland, and Wales?
(3.25.)  MR. COURTNEY  (Cornwall, Bodmin) : I do not object to the protest of the hon. Member for Lanarkshire (Mr. C. Graham) against a waste of time, but it is somewhat singular that the hon. Member who moved the rejection of the Bill did not utter a word of explanation in doing so. He did not even state that he thought all the arguments on the subject had been exhausted, and that a further speech was unnecessary. That being so, it appears to me as if the hon. Member's motive in the action he had taken was not to save the time of the House, but the hope that if the House proceeded to a Division at once the Bill would be rejected. That appears to me to have been the motive that actuated the hon. Member, but, if it was not so, perhaps he will rise in his place and clear himself of it. I have laid it down over and over again that if a Bill has been read a second time, referred to a Committee and passed by that Committee after being examined in all its details, and if, too, the Bill is defended by the Chairman of the Committee on the Third Reading stage
 749
(3.50.)  MR. COURTNEY : I beg now to move the following new Standing Order to follow Standing Order 193:—
 "No Bill originating in this House for confirming a Provisional Order or Provisional Certificate shall be read the first time after the Whitsuntide Recess."
 MR. COURTNEY : I am quite willing to try the experiment of adopting the 1st of June instead of Whitsuntide.
 MR. HAYDEN  (Leitrim, S.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland if he will grant the following Return, which appears on the Paper in my name:—
 "Return of the Correspondence between Mr. L. P. Hayden and the Irish Land Commission, between Mr. Hayden and the Attorney General for Ireland, and between Mr. Percy Magan, J. P., and the Attorney General for Ireland and the Irish Land Commission, in reference to charges brought against Mr. Magan, of having fraudulently obtained money under the Arrears Act; and the Correspondence between Mr. Magan and the Lord Chancellor, and the Irish Office and the Lord Chancellor, in the same matter."
 MR. P. O'BRIEN  (Monaghan, N.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether English prison officials are obliged to dress in uniform when off duty?
 MR. PIERCE MAHONY  (Meath, N.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General why the Postal Telegraph Office at Nobber, County Meath, has been closed; and whether he will take steps to have it reopened?
 MR. CAUSTON  (Southwark, W.) : May I ask when the Lords' Amendments to the London Public Health Bill will be considered? There are 11 pages of Amendments on the Paper, which was only issued this morning, and I wish to know whether the Amendments alter the character of the Bill or are likely to receive the support of the Government or not?
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : With regard to the Eight Hours Bill, I should like to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he is aware that an influential deputation of miners waited on the First Lord of the Treasury on this question, and although the right hon. Gentleman gave them no definite pledge, he certainly left in the minds of the vast majority of them an idea that a day would be granted for the discussion of the subject this Session.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : Is the standard rate of wages given by these contractors?
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : Why was this proviso made in this contract? If the wages are to be arranged by the Director of Contracts, the whole plan mentioned in the House as having been adopted by the Government falls to the ground.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : As a specialist, I must apologise for having used a technical word. I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether the fact that these men were fighting for money does not alter the case?
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : The right hon. Gentleman must not think I am against boxing, because I used to be very fond of it, but I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether in future, in any contest with or without gloves in which the  finale
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, we have just heard from a very responsible Member of the House an  ex parte
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I rise to protest against debating so small a question at so late a period of the Session. The whole question has already been fully discussed. I do not deny that the right hon. Gentleman has put all the facts clearly and cogently before the House, but we have heard them already and there is nothing more to be said upon the matter. Certainly nothing has occurred to-day to remove from the minds of hon. Members that a complete job is being perpetrated.
 MR. WHIT MORE  (Chelsea) : May I ask whether any decision has been arrived at in reference to the designs for the New South Kensington Buildings?
(5.36.)  MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I greatly regret that the Government assent to this Amendment. The right hon. Gentleman the Vice President said, "The Education Department will not bring pressure to bear to send Protestant children in large numbers to Roman Catholic schools. That means that the Department may use pressure to send small numbers—
 MR. S. SMITH : I am glad the right hon. Gentleman has withdrawn that, but I am here to protest against any pressure being put upon Protestant parents to send their children to Roman Catholic schools. Such a thing would excite the utmost dissatisfaction in the country. Of course, we wish to main-

 MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the Secretary of State is aware that among the public of Bombay serious alarm exists on account of the attitude and proceedings of the local police in connection with the case known as the Rajabai Tower Tragedy; whether he is aware that, in that case, the medical men who first viewed the corpses of the two Parsi girls, on the afternoon of the 25th of April, certified that there were on their persons certain marks indicating attempted outrage, but nevertheless, before the  post-mortem 755
 MR. STANLEY LEIGHTON  (Shropshire, Oswestry) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he can give the House any information with reference to the difficulties which have arisen in British Honduras; whether the report is true that the unofficial Members of the Legislative Council have resigned in a body, and that their places have been filled by gentlemen holding office under the Government; whether the Supreme Court of the Colony has pronounced a Council so constituted to be unconstitutional, and the taxation levied under their authority to be illegal; and whether, in view of somewhat similar incidents having occurred in other Crown Colonies, the Government will assent to the appointment of a Select Committee or a Royal Commission to inquire into the relations between the Colonial Office and the Crown Colonies?
(6.36.)  MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I think it would have been more satisfactory as a
 801 802
(7.52.)  MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : The two principles on which we supported this Bill were that it adopted the principle of free schools, and that where the fees were not to be entirely abolished it admitted the right of the parent to demand free places where they had not been provided; and in regard to the argument of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that this will lead to local difficulties and local friction, unfortunately the principle which has been adopted of retaining fees in certain schools will inevitably lead to local friction. It seems to me that the right of the parent in regard to this matter is a very strong one. He is entitled to demand not only free accommodation, but that it shall be suitable for the wants of himself and his children. That is all we ask for in this matter. We know that in a large number of towns the fees are very high, and the managers of voluntary schools will not voluntarily introduce a system of free schools. It will be necessary for the parents to demand free places, and it will be an advantage to the Department to know whether it is a question of accommodation and whether the accommodation is suitable or not. We on this

 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : I personally was in favour of the clause as proposed by the noble Lord opposite (Lord Cranborne), for I favour the system of grouping, because, though some of my hon. Friends think it will strengthen the position of voluntary
 826
 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON : I do not see that there is much in the suggested compromise of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, because Sub-section 2 will have very little effect if Sub-section 1 is carried. Sub-section 1 is by far the more important of the two. A few minutes ago, when I first asked a question as to this, and when I discovered that the matter was governed by a proviso as to the 17s. 6d. limit, the right hon. Gentleman opposite gave his consent to the proviso by nodding his head. I should like now to ask him what his views as to the question are. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are mixing up two things, and are endeavouring by a side wind to obtain larger concessions than were originally intended as to the grouping of voluntary schools. We thought to strengthen the Amendment by this proviso, but it appears they meant something different. It seems to me a curious commentary on our proceedings that whilst we were precluded in this Bill from discussing the 17s. 6d. limit, we are now entitled to do so on a Lords' Amendment. I do not think that such a matter ought to be introduced into the Bill—at any rate in this form. I was not one of those who thought that the 17s. 6d. limit in itself was a satisfactory mode of obtaining subscriptions, but, at the same time, when hon. Gentlemen argue as though the 17s. 6d. limit had been introduced to injure the poorer schools, I think they forget that it was introduced—to see that subscriptions to these advanced schools would be properly maintained—by a Conservative Government. If under the clause all the voluntary schools of the Kingdom were grouped, the 17s. 6d. limit would disappear. What we desire is that while giving the fullest possible power of grouping of management to voluntary schools, each individual school shall be treated as an individual item in regard to the grant and in regard to the fee grant. I do not think the Government in a matter like this should depart from principles that have governed elementary education since 1876. If we are going to reform the 17s. 6d. limit, let us discuss it on
 833
(7.58.)  MR. SYDNEY GEDGE  (Stockport) : Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton (Mr. Addison), I pressed on the Government the insertion of these words, but, unlike him, I have not changed my opinion, and hope sincerely that the Government may yet give way and allow them to be retained. There seems to be no doubt as to what the traditions of the Department have been in this matter. It is said that cases have occurred in which Roman Catholic public-elementary schools have been held to be unsuitable, and I think it right that they should so be held according to the manner in which they are conducted. But I do not stop there. It seems to me that it is possible for a public elementary school to be unsuitable for the wants of the population. A certain number of people live in a neighbourhood; they represent to the Department that a certain public elementary school is unsuitable for the wants of the district; the Department are convinced that that is the case, and, in spite of that, according to this Amendment, they are not to have the power to alter the state of things. We are told
 817
 MR. STERN  (Suffolk, Stowmarket) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether complaint has been made to his Department in reference to the neglect of the Wood-bridge Rural Sanitary Authority to carry out the Sanitary Act in connection with the supply of pure water to Otley, in Suffolk; how many cases of illness and death from fever have occurred in that district during the last two years, and will the Local Government Board use its powers to compel the Local Authority to proceed at once with the necessary works?
 MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I beg to ask whether the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in a position now to fix a day for taking the Indian Budget?
 MR. T. ELLIS : If the Government are sincere, the principle of the Bill is to give free education as soon as possible. We on this side are irreconcilably opposed to any obstacle being placed in the way of having, as soon as possible, free public school accommodation. I therefore hope my hon. Friend will divide the House against the Amendment.
(6.12.)  MR. T. ELLIS  (Merionethshire) : On the question of suitability, I wish to cite
 797 vice versâ
(7.0.)  MR. T. ELLIS : It is much to be deplored that the Government should take this reactionary step at the bidding of the House of Lords. In the original Bill there was a valuable clause that no higher fee than 3d. should be charged, but now it seems to me that, having omitted that clause from the Bill, it would be wise for the right hon. Gentleman to adhere to the Amendment accepted readily when the Bill was last before us. By this Amendment Parliamentary sanction will be given to a most vicious system of differentiating between one child and another, differentiating in the very worst form. In previous discussions it was urged several times that we should expect school managers to give some  quid pro quo
 MR. T. ELLIS : I should like to know whether it would be possible under the clause for the whole of the schools of one denomination in a county to combine under one scheme? If that is so, it should be carefully considered, for it seems to me a step outside the scope of this Free Education Bill.
 MR. T. ELLIS : It seems to me that in accepting this Amendment we shall be taking a very long step. No doubt the clause will be the realisation of the fond hope of certain supporters of voluntary schools of having what is called Church School Boards, and that is a question which can be discussed on its own merits. We think that such a Board of self-elected managers is a very poor control indeed to have over vast sums of public money. But that is not the point I wish to call attention to. Here we have a great change proposed in the organisation of the educa-
 827
(11.21.)  MR. T. ELLIS : I beg to propose an Amendment that, in line 5, after the word "department," the words "forthwith be laid before Parliament," be inserted. I may point out that this Amendment simply carries out the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
 MR. T. ELLIS : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept this Amendment. It is very necessary that the Education Department should have some power to revise or, if right, to withdraw a scheme. Ten or fifteen schools may be grouped together, and to withhold the grant may disorganise the whole educational facilities of an entire district.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : When the hon. Gentleman says some of the supporters of the Government are opposing the endowment of Roman Catholics in Ireland, let me point out that in Ireland we have a mixed system of State education, and that it is proposed to infringe upon that system. In England and Scotland the system is denominational. I am against denominational education, hence the position I have taken up.
*(3.15.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : Then I am afraid I must descend. There are occasions when a Member is bound by the duty he owes to his constituents, and to a great community beyond his constituency, to object to a Bill root and branch, even though he incur the risk of such a charge as that brought against him by the right hon. Gentleman—though I do not believe the right hon. Gentleman will be able to find anyone outside this House to agree with him that I ever joined in obstructing any measure. In the past I have seldom taken part in opposition to a measure the Government have introduced—and I am proud to acknowledge it—but this is a Bill the object of which is to hand a blank cheque to Archbishop Walsh and a similar blank cheque to Archbishop Plunket. We are to endow a Roman Catholic Training College and a Protestant Training College, and I am informed that the Protestant College it is proposed to buy under the Bill was presented to the Church Society when the Kildare Street Society was abolished, so that it is now proposed to buy back that which was given for nothing. I shall oppose this Resolution and the object with which it is proposed through every stage by every means in my power.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I do not think that is a fair statement for the right hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary to make with regard to me. He has no right to say that I am descending to tactics of obstruction.
*(3.10.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I do not consider that it is expedient to do anything of the kind. Moreover, it is neither expedient nor reasonable for the House at a quarter past 3 o'clock in the morning to be asked to enter upon contentious business. If the Government resolve to carry this Resolution they will do so only after a great struggle. I now beg leave to move to report Progress.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : Under all the circumstances, and notwithstanding what the right hon. Gentleman has said, I shall support my hon. Friend in his Motion.
*(3.48.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I think this is the most unreasonable course the Government have ever pursued, namely, that they should call upon me and on many of their best supporters to continue this Debate at the bidding of their bitterest enemies. The charge which has been made against myself, and, of course, by implication hurled at every man who has supported and stood by the Government in their bitterest hour of trial, is one which I and my friends resent and repudiate. The Resolution which has been put from the Chair declares that it is expedient to authorise the expenditure of a certain sum of money for a certain purpose which I need not recapitulate. I shall show to the House that this sum is not named in the Resolution, nor is it named in the Bill, and that is one of the great objections I have to the whole operation. We are called upon to give blank cheques to Archbishop Walsh and Archbishop Plunket, and to leave it to those gentlemen to fill up these cheques as they may think proper, and as the Board of Works may think proper. If it be expedient to expend this money we ought, first of all, to know how much we are to spend; and, secondly, we ought thoroughly to understand what it is to be spent for. We cannot do the first, because the Bill does not tell us, and we can only find out what the money is to be spent for by examining the objects the Government have in view. What are the objects of the Government as indicated by this Resolution and the Bill on which it is
 875 876
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : If we have to go on and discuss this Resolution to-night it will have to be discussed at great length. [An hon. MEMBER: "Why?"]
 874
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : Well, what would the right hon. Gentleman have said to such a proposal as this if he had been in the House?
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I heartily welcome the announcement of the right hon. Gentleman. A proposal to pay the money out of the Irish Church Surplus will give us better fighting ground. Any Motion to give money from that Fund for the support of Roman Catholic training colleges will outrage a good many people. I should like to know what the right hon. Gentleman would have said to such a proposal when he sat below the Gangway on this side of the House? What did he say when the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian disestablished the Irish Church?
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : Only partly.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : That is not the object of the Resolution, which is to give the whole cost of the building and appurtenances. That is entirely different to the English system, and I shall oppose it by every means in my power.
*(4.14.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : The hon. Member for West Belfast assumes a position towards Members of this House which he has no right to assume. He has no right to ask why I dare do this or that. As a matter of fact, he is wrong in what he says, and I will now explain to the House the position I have taken up in this matter. The Bill has, no doubt, been before the House a very long time, but I think many Members have not had time to examine its provisions. After the speech of the First Lord of the Treasury on the 15th June I assumed the Bill would not be pressed, as it was not included in the right hon. Gentleman's list. Therefore, it was not deemed necessary to take active steps to oppose it. But when we found the Government determined to force it through the House, the Ulster Members were compelled to take active measures. The pressure from our constituents was such that we could not resist it. We know that hon. Members below the Gangway have shown they are quite as open to such pressure as we are. The hon. Member asks how I dare do such and such a thing. I ask him, in return, "Who made him ruler over me, and who gave him authority thus to question me?" I dare do it because it is my duty to do it, and I deny his right to question me in such a tone and such a manner. In 1883 the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bridgeton said the Government were prepared to encourage and facilitate the establishment of training colleges under local management in Ireland by authorising the Commissioners to make grants towards their maintenance, and as the English system of training colleges was the outcome of
 880
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : The English principle is to give grants in aid, and this was done under the scheme of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bridgeton.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : It was up to a certain point.
 *MR. T. W. RUSSELL : And one of the main reasons for opposing this Resolution is that the Marlborough Street College will be destroyed. By carrying this Bill you will cause the undenominational system to be doomed. The Catholic Bishops of Ireland were the first to strike at that system, and it was their action which necessitated the action which the Synod of the Protestant Church took in 1885. I wish to urge on the House that we are already doing in Ireland what is done in England. We are giving grants in aid. It is quite true there is an undenominational College in Dublin maintained by the State, but that is a result of the system. But if this Bill is carried we shall be going further than we have gone in England. Buildings have never been paid for in England.
 MR. SEXTON : Yes they have.
 MR. SEXTON : The Marlborough Street College was treated differently from the rest.
 MR. SEXTON : No.
 MR. SEXTON : The difficulty is this: In England all colleges are treated alike: in Ireland one college is placed on a different footing from the rest.
(3.55.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I think the hon. Member for Tyrone ought to be ashamed of himself for describing this Resolution as contentious business. The hon. Gentleman objects to taking this business after 12 o'clock, I presume, because he was afraid his speech would not be reported if it were delivered after that hour; but I would remind the House that in my presence and hearing the hon. Member for Tyrone appealed to the hon. Member for Camberwell to withdraw his opposition to the Bill, and that being so, it will require more cogent arguments than the hon. Member for Tyrone has employed to explain his own position in regard to this matter, and how it is he has been led to take two positions diametrically opposite to each other in as many weeks. The hon. Gentleman has taunted the Chief Secretary with accepting this measure at the suggestion and bidding of hon. Members on this side of the House. He does not seem to have taken the trouble to have read the public letter on which the Bill is founded. He does not tell us that the Resolution is supported by the unanimous vote of the Education Board itself. The hon. Member thinks himself a more valuable defender of the mixed system of education than the regular garrison. Who are they? The Education Board-gentlemen of undoubted  status 877
 MR. SEXTON : We shall have to raise a question upon this Vote, and it
 867
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I think the hon. Member for the St. Rollox Division (Mr. Caldwell) is perfectly justified, and I protest against the unwarranted construction put upon the hon. Member's action by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The whole proceeding is one of give and take, and, as the hon. Member has expressed his readiness to proceed, I do not see that there is any justification for the remarks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This is the first time I have heard the Votes in Class V. described as non-contentious. There must certainly be Debate upon them, and I think it would be sharp practice to take the Vote for the Consular and Diplomatic Service unexpectedly in the absence of the hon. Member for Northampton, who we know takes great interest in that Vote. There are Votes in Classes VI. and VII. not the subject of Notices on the Paper, and these, perhaps, might be taken.
 MR. SEXTON : There are two questions I recently asked in relation to this Vote, and I take the opportunity to recall them to the attention of the Secretary to the Treasury. I mentioned the mean
 868
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the Postmaster General, with regard to the arrangements for the accelerated mail service in connection with Belfast, whether the Belfast sorters at present are on duty from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m., from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., from 12.15 p.m. to 4.15 p.m., and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.; and whether there is any truth in the report that they are now to be called upon to surrender the forenoon interval of rest,
 777
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in view of the fact that the Irish National Education Board has paid results fees for passes in book-keeping for the past 10 years in Castle Hill National School, Gilford, though the time always devoted to the subject was only two half-hours per week, and that the Board has never refused to pay fees to this school for passes in algebra, geometry, physical geography, music, or drawing, the time devoted to each of these subjects being two half-hours weekly, will he explain under what rule the Board has this year refused to pay the fees for book-keeping, not because the time given to it was less than formerly or less than that given to any other voluntary or extra subject, but simply because the two lessons in each week were given on the same day; and, considering that the time given to this subject was as much for last year as for any other extra subject taught in the school during the past 10 years, and also considering that 92 per cent. of those presented passed the examination, will the Board, upon reconsideration, pay the amount withheld?
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that the Intermediate
 776
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : Then give us a part.
 *MR. M'LAREN  (Cheshire, Crewe) : The right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot deny that this allows the raising of fees in what he calls graded schools from 9d. to 1s. That, as a matter of fact, is the effect of the clause, because the limit is now 9d., and the future limit will be 9d.,  plus
 *MR. BRODRICK : The proviso was made in this case because the trade is not a general one, but peculiar to the requirements of the War Department. There is no standard rate of wages, and no market for rejections. The War Office found that the wages offered to the people employed in this particular trade were what might be termed of a sweating description. It was felt that the Government ought to prevent their work being executed in that way, and for that reason a price was agreed upon
 763
 *MR. BRODRICK : The rates of wages are agreed upon and are published in the workshop, where every man can see what he is entitled to.
 *MR. BRODRICK : The material can be purchased any where, provided that it is according to contract, and care is taken to see that the conditions laid down are carried out.
 *MR. BRODRICK : Messrs. Ross and Co. are prohibited from providing any manufactured goods of any sort or kind. But contractors for the War Office have-power to obtain the material in any market, provided the article complies with the terms of the contract.
 *THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY, WAR DEPARTMENT (Mr. BRODRICK,  Surrey, Guildford : Messrs. Hebbert & Co. hold the contract for pouches and belts for telegraph messengers. Under the contract the contractors are required to have the cutting-out done on their own premises, but there is no restriction as to the source whence the
 762
 MR. HUNTER : Arising out of the question, may I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, having regard to the contentious matters that would arise in connection with the distribution of this money in Scotland, he cannot adopt the same course in this case as the Chief Secretary adopted in respect to Ireland, and postpone the application of the money until next year?
 MR. HUNTER : The right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Stirling Burghs (Mr. Campbell Bannerman), who is unable to be present, has asked me to press the Government to postpone the Vote as suggested.
 MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate whether it would be competent for a County Council to apply its share of the sum of £100,000, proposed to be given in relief of local rates in Scotland, wholly and exclusively in relief of the county rates paid by owners only?
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : As to the furniture I cannot give any answer, but I take note of the hon. Member's observation. As to the maps, if I remember rightly, I was informed that it was usual to wait until sets were complete before renewing them, but I will refer to the matter again.
 MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : I regret that the Government should think it necessary to proceed with the Bill at this time of the Session against, the wish, pretty strongly expressed, of every supporter they have from Ireland. My objection to the Bill has not been removed by the concession made. I object to the measure as framed altogether, as it is merely giving a blank cheque to the ecclesiastics who have been mentioned.
 MR. MACARTNEY : Will the right hon. Gentleman be prepared to make a binding agreement with the Railway Companies to carry the mails as they were carried up to a recent period?
 MR. MACARTNEY  (Antrim, S.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if he will explain why the English night mails for Belfast and other places in the North of Ireland, which have been carried over the City of Dublin Junction Railway (Loop Line) from 4th February until 27th July, have since that date been carted from Westland Row Station to Amiens Street Station, although the through passenger service is still carried on over the loop line; whether the Railway Company offered to continue the mail service as hitherto; and whether their offer has been accepted; and, if not, what arrangements have been made for the carriage of the northern mails over the loop line on and after 1st August, when the accelerated service will commence.
 MR. TOMLINSON : The hon. Member speaks of the feeling of the constituencies, but I can assure him that Preston does not share his view. The managers of elementary schools in Preston do not entertain the view that Protestant children will be forced into Roman Catholic schools, and I have no doubt that when this Act is passed, though it was not desired by some of us, it will be so administered that none of the risks which are feared will be experienced.
 MR. TOMLINSON  (Preston) : The largest is St. Walburge's.
 MR. TOMLINSON : The clause itself supplies a limitation, "the neighbouring district."
(5.30.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : The Government passed through this House a Bill which, though there were some points in it to which we took exception, was on the whole a satisfactory one. The House of Lords has dealt with this Bill as it is in the habit of dealing with a great many Bills. It has spoilt the measure of the House of Commons. I am sorry, for the sake of the right hon. Gentleman, that the Lords should have introduced this Amendment, because it will go very far to spoil his Bill in the estimation of the country when it is passed. Everybody will remember that there was an almost unanimous feeling in this House as to the introduction of this word. It was not a mere Party question at all, but it was a matter upon which Members on both sides of the House who were interested in education had the same opinion. It is only under the compulsion of men in the House of Lords who are the enemies of free education that this thing has now been done. It is with the express object of injuring and, I might say,
 790
 SIR W. HARCOURT : One at a time.
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I wish to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Government contemplate having a Sitting on Saturday, and whether there are any Bills still before the House for the consideration of which a particular day can be fixed?
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I can assure my hon. Friend—the communications having passed a good deal through myself—that he is entirely mistaken. There is no assurance that this Bill is not to be proceeded with in the absence of the right hon. Member for Mid Lothian, who takes a deep interest in the Bill.
*(11.4.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I have been very anxious to see this Bill passed, and I have refrained from speaking upon it, but I think it is time to protest against the spirit in which the Government are trying to shove it down our throats to-night. Here we have a new clause brought up from another place, and we are not allowed an opportunity of discussing it thoroughly. I do not object to two schools being joined together if they are in the same district. I know from experience that that would probably be an advantage. I have for 20 years been manager and hon. secretary of the Church schools in my own parish, and, therefore, I know something about the management of these institutions. But what I do object to is the grouping together of different districts, or even of several counties as might occur under this clause. The word "neighbouring," I hold with my hon. Friends from Wales, should be taken out of the clause.
 *MR. MORTON : We want to discuss the Royal Commission on Vaccination, and upon these Miscellaneous Expenses there is a good deal of information required; for instance, there are the fees for honours and dignities, an interesting topic. I hope Progress will now be reported.
*(2.23.)  MR. MORTON : I am aware that indentures are sent from the Education Department, and that they provide that there shall be no Sunday labour? We in our parish have always stipulated that none of the teachers need do any Sunday work. After what we have heard to-night and what we see in the papers in regard to the employment of teachers, especially in rural districts, I should like the right hon. Gentleman to assure us that the condition as to Sunday labour shall be carried out.
*(1.51.)  MR. MORTON : As I did not trouble the Committee to divide, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will now give us an explanation with regard to the Inspectors under Sub-head C. Will he give us an assurance that qualified
 862
 *MR. MORTON : There may have been one or two of these appointments given to teachers, but there have been very few. And now I desire to ask two or three questions on the figures themselves, and to move a reduction. I do not understand at all the case of the London Office. I do not object to the salary of the Vice President. He does his work pretty well, but I find that he has a secretary at a salary of £1,800, and it is on that item that I am about to move a reduction, because I find that the secretary in Scotland only gets £1,200. I see that this salary is "personal" to the present secretary, meaning, probably, that when there is a vacancy in the office the salary will be reduced. But I do not think the English secretary should be paid more than the Scotch. I do not believe there is more work to be done by this gentleman in the English Office than by the gentleman in the Scotch Office, for the latter is also a senior examiner. Altogether we pay much more for educational business in England than we do in Scotland. So far as I can see we pay quite enough for the Scotch business, and I think, therefore, there ought to be a reduction on this Vote. One of the senior examiners gets an allowance of £100 per annum. What does he receive that for? It seems to me an extravagant and unnecessary payment beyond the £1,200 a year salary. This senior examiner has assistant examiners, of the salaries of £800 a year. There are junior examiners at £600 a year, one of them being usually employed in connection with the Science and Art Department, and another in connection with the Civil Service Commissioners. [ Cries of 861 Cries of and interruption
 *MR. MORTON : These gentlemen want and are entitled to something more than the sympathy of the right hon. Gentleman; they want these offices. Now, 1 desire to get some explanation with regard to the allowance of £250 per annum to the Inspectors for travelling and personal expenses. The gross amount of that item is £20,000, but, in addition to that, there is an additional charge of £14,000 for travelling and incidental expenses. Is not the £250 a year sufficient?
 *MR. MORTON : I think we ought to have further explanations than that. If the agreed allowance of £250 is not sufficient, it should be increased. Why are there two items; why is not the whole sum properly set out.
*(1.0.)  MR. MORTON : I do not agree with the remark of the right hon. Member for Sheffield in saying that we devote the largest sum of money given by any civilised country to educational purposes. I believe I am right in saying that a larger sum is spent upon this object in America.
 *MR. MORTON : It does not matter how you get the money, whether from the Local Authorities or from the State, as long as the amount is all right, and there can be no doubt that the amount spent in America is much larger than in England.
*(1.32.)  MR. MORTON : I think the right hon. Gentleman might as well have suggested that we should adjourn this matter now. He says the hour is too late to go on with the discussion. I agree that he has had a very hard night's work; but the Government of the country must go on. I therefore move, Mr. Courtney, that you do report Progress and ask leave to sit again. I am anxious that the business of the Session should be brought to an early termination, but I want to go into these matters properly. The right hon. Gentleman has not answered any of my points satisfactorily. I do not press him to do so to-night as I am willing to go into the matter to-morrow, and, therefore, it is that I move to report Progress.
 *MR. MORTON : The right hon. Gentleman says it is more than double, and I have no doubt he is right now, although he was wrong before. If I had not corrected him when I did a wrong impression would have gone abroad to the country, but what I want to do is to
 857 858
 *MR. MORTON : I would ask leave to withdraw my Motion, but, of course, I must go on with my criticism of the accounts.
 MR. GOURLEY  (Sunderland) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he has considered the finding of the Court of Inquiry appointed to examine into the cause of the burning of the fire-bars of the  Sharpshooter Spanker
*(3.20.)  SIR E. J. HARLAND  (Belfast, N.) : I also must express regret at my right hon. Friend having brought forward this Bill at this period of the Session. I can assure my right hon. Friend that in the North of Ireland the objectionable character of the course he has taken will be very keenly felt.
 MR. DIXON-HARTLAND  (Middlesex, Uxbridge) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, in view of the statement contained in the Treasury Letter to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 19th June,. 1884, with regard to the promotion of Lower Division clerks, the Treasury will endeavour, so far as is possible, to fill up vacancies in the First Division by the promotion of eligible and qualified
 769
 MR. BRUNNER  (Cheshire, Northwich) : May I suggest that instead of fixing the 1st of June it would be better to name a definite time after the beginning of the Session.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham : The Secretary of State has no official information as to the facts stated in the question. The Petition to the Bombay Government signed by Sir Jamsetjee Jeheebhoy and others seems to have been presented while the proceedings against the accused man were going on. The Bombay Government very properly refused to interfere with the course of justice, but reserved the consideration of the necessity for further inquiry until the trial was concluded. The whole matter has received, and is receiving, the fullest attention of the Government of Bombay, and the Secretary of State sees no reason for interference.
(6.41.)  SIR J. LUBBOCK  (London University) : When this clause was in Committee I very strongly supported it, and I still believe it is very valuable; and when it is attacked I reply by pointing out the safeguards, namely, that there is to be sufficient and suitable free accommodation, and that the right to charge fees in certain cases is limited to those in which the population has shifted, or in which the charge would be for the educational advantages of the district. If the words "and suitable" had never been introduced, I suppose that the word "sufficient" would have implied suitability. But that may not be the case now. I attach no importance to the argument that the word would have a different meaning in the Act of 1870, if that be so. The meaning of any word depends to some extent on the context. I cannot agree with some of my hon. Friends who blame the Government. I cannot find fault with the Government, who had perhaps difficulty in carrying Amendments in another place. At the same time, I regret they will not agree to the retention of the word "suitable." That is the view held by the hon. Member for Woolwich, who has certainly great experience, and who is entitled to speak on the matter. I venture to express the hope that Her Majesty's Government will re-consider the matter, and will agree to the retention of the word "suitable."
 SIR J. MOWBRAY  (Oxford University) : In my opinion, the date fixed ought to have reference to the end of the Session and the difficulty of obtaining Members to sit on Committees as the Session advances. For this reason I think the 1st of June would be preferable to Whitsuntide.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I also object to the words "with due despatch," and if my hon. Friend goes to a Division I shall support him.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : We have not yet heard a reply to the suggestion of my hon. Friend that these schemes should be laid before Parliament. The objection of the hon. Member (Mr. Roby) is a valid one. "Neighbouring districts" might be made to include districts extending from Cardiff to Holyhead, but the objection might be met by a proviso that the assent of the House should be required to every scheme.
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I think that the adoption of these words would prevent any Board school combining with another Board school. I would, therefore, suggest that the Amendment should read—
 "Provided that no board school shall be associated with any public elementary school other than a board school under this section."
 MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : Do the Government intend to proceed with the Clergy Discipline Bill, then, this Session?
 MR. S. T. EVANS : I trust the Government will not come to the conclusion
 864
 MR. LEA : I said the Act in which I am particularly interested.
(3.4.)  MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I wish to refer to a particular Act which is included in the schedule, and in which I take a particular interest. For nine years the Act has been renewed in this Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and the circumstance has on one occasion
 869
(4.5.)  MR. LEA : The hon. Member for West Belfast has censured my hon. Friend the Member for South Tyrone for having, on a recent occasion, objected to the Training Colleges Bill being taken after 12 o'clock. I wonder how many times he has himself used the 12 o'clock Rule to stop Bills being proceeded with. He has done so hundreds of times, and I submit he has no right to charge my hon. Friend with vanity, because he desires that this Bill should be discussed at a time when the Debate may be reported in the Press. I know that my hon. Friend has a large amount of Blue Book evidence which he wishes to lay before the House regarding this Bill, and he certainly could not reasonably be asked to do that at 4 o'clock in the morning. I think the evidence he has to adduce will startle the House. This is a proposal to take the money of the Irish Church and to apply it to the support of denominational training colleges. I voted in 1868 for the disestablishment of the Irish Church, and I venture to say that no follower of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian ever contemplated that the funds of that Church should go to the support of Roman Catholic training colleges.
 MR. LEA : At any rate, it is a Resolution to give the taxpayers' money for the support of Roman Catholic training colleges. The college buildings and appurtenances are to be purchased, and I should like to know if these appurtenances include altars and crosses? Why should the taxpayers of this country have to pay
 879
 MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : The right hon. Gentleman says he brings this Resolution in as a concession to those who oppose the Bill, but I hold that he could very well have brought in this Resolution at a later stage. I cannot conceive what his object can be in endeavouring to force it on now when he could easily put it down for a later stage. It is absurd to expect us to discuss it when we have been sitting 12 or 13 hours.
 MR. LEA : As it is now half-past 3, I beg to move that you, Mr. Courtney, do now leave the Chair.
 MR. LEA : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if the arrangements are now completed for sending mails for the North of Ireland  viâ
 MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware that the tenants in the Belvill Estate,
 773
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : I wish to know whether, if a man is killed in one of these encounters, it would be held to be a case of justifiable homicide?
 MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : There are no fewer than 137 Amendments to the Bill. No doubt many of them are non-contentious and some consequential, but there are others which will cause discussion, and, in view of the number of Amendments, I wish to ask whether the Government cannot fix a particular day next week for the consideration of the Bill?
(4.22.)  MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : Fifty minutes have now elapsed since the last Division was taken. I beg, consequently, to move that you do now report Progress. It is monstrous that the House should be called upon to sit here till 20 past 4 discussing a question of a very contentious character. I think the Government will be wise in consenting to my Motion.
(1.46.)  MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : Having listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Peterborough, I do not think he asked any frivolous questions, and I hold that he is entitled to an answer. At the same time, considering the lateness of the hour, I hope he will not press the Motion to a Division. I trust that next year the Estimates will be discussed at an earlier stage of the Session. It is not, however, advisable that we should now lay ourselves open to the charge of obstruction in connection with the passing of this Vote.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The school teachers of this country know that they have always had my sympathy. I have stated already that we have decided to adopt the policy of not excluding teachers from these appointments, but since that decision has been come to no vacancy has occurred which could have been so filled.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The Estimate is in its present form to enable Parliament to distinguish between the money paid for travelling and that for personal expenses.
*(1.55.)  SIR W. HART DYKE : I can only tell the hon. Member that the question of travelling expenses is carefully watched by the Department. They are necessarily considerable, but none are incurred that can be avoided.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I assure the hon. Member I shall do everything to see that the provision is carried out.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : When I said there were no vacancies I referred to the higher division of Inspectors. I will inquire further into the matter.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : Since it has been decided to consider the claims of teachers to these appointments, there has been no vacancy in the Inspectorate which has not been absorbed.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : That has been effected long ago.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I can assure the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Mundella) that the Department is fully alive to its obligations in regard to seeing that adequate school accommodation is provided. This and the other questions as to auditing accounts, and so forth, will be carefully considered. There are various articles in the Code of 1890 which provide the necessary securities, and I shall be happy to give the hon. Member a copy. It will be more convenient both for him and me that he should read them than that I should wade through them here at this hour of the morning.
(5.18.)  THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : The right hon. Gentleman, having made some remarks which were exceedingly moderate, has concluded with the rather wide statement that if we retain this Amendment we shall be committing a breach of faith. I think that is rather a strong thing to say.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : Sir, I must really protest against this construction being placed upon what I said. I referred to a statement made by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Sheffield (Mr. Mundella).
 SIR W. HART DYKE : The right hon. Gentleman has changed his statement into an hypothesis. I believe that ample means might be found to meet the case we have in hand. It is perfectly true that in this House the Amendment inserting the word "suitable" was accepted by the Government, and it is equally true that in another place they assented to the word being struck out. But considering the far-reaching character of the Commons' Amendment, I think it may be fairly urged that in the other House the Government treated the matter in a broad and statesmanlike spirit. The right hon. Gentleman has placed upon the word "suitable" a construction which it has never borne before; and if there had been any doubt as to the advisability or otherwise of the course now taken by the Government, I think it has been removed by the speech of the right hon. Gentleman. It is obvious that a word like this must be dealt with in a reasonable and elastic manner by the Department in solving the difficulties' which it has to face every day; and if difficulties had not been so met, these Acts would long since have produced intolerable chaos and confusion. There is, however, a vast difference between construing the word in a reasonable manner and introducing into a Bill for the first time an entirely new meaning. The right hon. Gentleman has referred to free schools being possibly wide apart, and to the fact that infants are often taken to school by their brothers and sisters. These, however, are purely administrative difficulties which will have to be met by the Department. The word "suitable"

 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I repudiate the assertion altogether.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The word in the Act of 1870 bears a different application from what is intended in this case.
 *THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : A grant of £15 has been paid to the Broomfield School for many years, under the authority of Section 19 of the Elementary Education Act, 1876, on the ground that the population within two miles, measured according to the nearest road, is less than 200, and that there is no other public elementary school recognised by the Department as available for that population.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The new infants' school which the Department have sanctioned is only new in the sense of its having been transferred to new buildings, and it is not the practice to place any obstacle in the way of managers improving their school accommodation, whatever vacant places may be found in neighbouring schools. The Department have not refused to sanction the erection of a new Board school at the west end of the town, but have, after careful inquiry, expressed an opinion that the project should, for the present, be deferred. I am not able to follow the hon. Member in respect to his concluding suggestion, as it was a fundamental principle of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, and has since been an axiom of the Department's administration that every public elementary school is,  ipso facto
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I do not wish to prolong the discussion, and will only
 841
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : In accordance with the promise I made, I beg to move to omit Sub-section (2) and to add at the end of the clause—
 "Provided that schools provided by a school board shall not be grouped with any other public elementary school."
*(12.3.)  SIR W. HART DYKE : The duty now devolves upon me, though at rather a late hour, to make the statement as to the educational work of the year ending August 31st, 1890. I have a twofold duty to perform; for while I have to deal with what has been done in the way of educational work in the year ending August 31st, 1890, I have also
 844 845 846 847 848 849 Sir,—It is hoped that the time which has been hitherto employed in recording in greater detail the results of the annual examinations may now he employed in paying visits without notice. Such visits will in future form an important factor of your annual Report upon a school, and will differ from the annual visit of inspection chiefly in this, that the character and intelligence of the lessons, which may be given in your presence, and the order, neatness, cheerfulness, and general bearing of the scholars will constitute the principal objects of your observation. Some time should also be spent in friendly conference with the managers (whose presence is very desirable) and with the teachers on the general character of the education given, and on special detailed points of school management or teaching on which your advice may be sought." 850 "Grammar has always been an unpopular subject, more especially in the rural portion of Dorsetshire. It is generally found to be too difficult a subject for the rustic children, and will in future, I think, be gratefully relegated in many instances to the second place, if not discarded altogether. The compulsory precedence of English as a class subject has for years been looked upon as a grievance by managers, teachers, and parents in this district, and the removal of this condition will be cordially welcomed by them." 851 852 "Evening schools which had almost died out in Bradford seven years ago are now rapidly increasing. They have, however, changed their character. Whereas their object used to he the rescue from ignorance of those whose education had been neglected in childhood, their present purpose is to extend the knowledge which has been previously acquired in some of the many excellent day schools. This year the number of scholars will be more than 2,000. It is very satisfactory to find that in four years the number enrolled has more than doubled itself." 853
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I recognise the spirit in which the hon. Member has moved the Amendment, but he seems to have the idea that once the Education Department approves a scheme the scheme cannot be altered. The hon. Member's fear is an exaggerated one. The Department must always retain a power to modify arrangements they have approved. For instance, if there be any such abuse discovered they can refuse the grant to a school. I therefore think the insertion of these words is unnecessary.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : I have to move the omission of the words in lines 2 and 3 "not being schools provided by a school board."
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : Yes, Sir.
*(11.16.)  SIR W. HART DYKE : It is impossible for Her Majesty's Government to acquiesce in the hon. Member's proposal. I have already indicated what the policy of the Department is to be in respect of this clause, but the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman would cut at the very principle of the clause. I am, however, willing to expunge the words "not being schools provided by a school board." The Government do not wish the House to be detained very long over this clause, and they are anxious to meet hon. Members opposite in a fair and candid manner. I must say that the Amendment I have suggested will throw some trouble and labour on the Education Department, but we are prepared, in the interests of peace and harmony, to consent to it.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The same phrase occurs in Clause 6, and the Amendment is unnecessary. When hon. Members seek thus to make the clause restrictive, I can only repeat that as to what are neighbouring districts, or as to the number of schools to be grouped, it must depend on the Department to deal in a common sense, practical way with any difficulties under this head. I hope the House will not accept the Amendment.
*(10.37.)  SIR W. HART DYKE : I think the question of the number of schools to be grouped together may be fairly left to the discretion of the Education Department, by which every scheme will have to be approved.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The earlier portion of the clause says that it "hall be in accordance with a scheme to be approved by the Education Department.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : This was inserted in another place with the assent of the leaders of the Opposition there. The clause enables voluntary schools in any district to form themselves into groups with the approval of the Education Department for the purposes of this Act. The object is to make more operative Clause 5, which empowers managers
 825
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : On the point of order, I think these words refer exclusively to the Bill before the House. My noble Friend the Lord President took the opinion of the highest legal authority in the country as to the effect of these words, and he was assured the words do apply exclusively to this Bill, and not directly or indirectly with the Act of 1870.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : We are prepared to accept words which will make it perfectly clear that under no possibility should this proviso refer to the provisions of the Act of 1870. But I am not sure that the Amendment, with the proposed addition, will read well. I would suggest that we should insert after "in," in line 2, "such last mentioned."
*(8.59.)  SIR W. HART DYKE : I think that the right hon. Gentleman must have altogether misunderstood the scope of the Amendment. In order to allay the alarm of the right hon. Gentleman, I may say that the only object of the Amendment is to place the Board schools on the same footing with the voluntary schools as far as regards public inquiry. It will be very rarely, indeed, that such an inquiry will be required. When the right hon. Gentleman says the Amendment is a dila-
 821
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : Not average, but ordinary.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : The word "ordinary" has been inserted to be in accordance with the words of the Definition Clause in the Act of 1870, which says that the ordinary payment for instruction shall not exceed 9d. a week. Now, this is a scheme whereby we say, after the fee grant of 3d. a week, the ordinary fee shall not exceed 6d. per week—that is to say, it may be the balance of fee.
*(7.27.)  SIR W. HART DYKE : I cannot see the force of the argument of the hon. Member and the right hon. Gentleman opposite. It appears to me we have already discussed this point fully in all its bearings, and have come to a decisive vote on the question of the
 810
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : That has been the case as regards the Metropolis, but not, generally speaking, as applied to the rest of the country.
 *SIR W. HART DYKE : But what I want to point out is that this has been adopted as part of the policy of the Department, and why, then, in the name of common sense, not leave well alone? Why not be satisfied with the result of experience—why emphasise this? I am tempted to believe—I wish to give every consideration to my opponents—but if you are not content to let well alone and rely on the well established practice of 21 years, if you will not do that, and wish these words inserted, then I am forced to the conviction that you mean something more than you are now stating. The hon. Member for Northamptonshire says it is a much wider question than the one we have already dealt with; and if he frankly tells us that, surely it is not the right way to tempt us to come to a different decision from that we arrived at on the last Amendment after exhaustive discussion. The rejection of this Amendment will seriously affect, or may seriously affect, the future policy of the Department as regards the working of the Act. I have shown that in the past policy of the Department there is no cause shown for the insertion of these words, and we are content to base our demand for the acceptance of the Lords' Amendment on the administration of 21 years, which has worked extremely well. The words are not necessary as applied to schools receiving the Government grant and protected by the Conscience Clause.
(9.58.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE  (Lancashire, N.E., Darwen) : If this clause passes without the proviso, even though one school receives the fee grant earned by the other school, it would not be able to count that grant as against the 17s. 6d. limit. The 17s. 6d. limit was established to prevent schools, even though they earned large grants, from getting the advantage of the grant unless they showed contributions from other sources. If they can produce income from other sources that objection falls to the ground. Under the grouping scheme you may be able to secure, not only the voluntary subscriptions and the other income, but part of the fee grant of the richer schools may be given to the poorer schools. The whole scheme of the 17s. 6d. limit rests on two considerations; in the first place, that the school earns the grant, and, secondly, that it earns it without ill-treating the children. There is no reason why these two conditions should not be fulfilled. Under the Amendment as it comes to us from the Lords they must be fulfilled. Well, if the proviso of the right hon. Gentleman were inserted, and if it were provided that the grant handed over by the richer schools to the poorer ones should not count as against the 17s. 6d. limit, the House would be taking a step not at all founded on reason. The right hon. Gentleman said the clause was far-reaching. It is true that for all purposes of the Act if a scheme is set on foot it must be treated as a single one. I see no objection to that. The principle thing to do is to give elasticity to the system, which is in the interests of free education. The system we contemplate is this, that under the grouping system, where, say, six schools agree to work together, it will be quite possible to make five of them free, the remaining school to continue a fee-paying school, It seems an ideal system that the fee-paying
 831
(3.14.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE  (Lancashire, N.E., Darwen) : The hon. Member who moved the rejection of the Bill refrained from giving any reasons why a measure, which was fully discussed upon the Second Reading and has passed the ordeal of a Committee, should be rejected at the eleventh hour. When the Bill was before the House for Second Reading we were told that the measure was very much opposed by the parish, and it was pointed out that there was a petition against it from the Vestry. It appeared, however, when the Committee met upstairs that the Vestry had withdrawn their petition and that the Bill was altogether unopposed except by a certain charitable Trust. One of the great points on the Second Reading was that it was proposed to destroy an artistic monument, but no architects for artistic purposes appeared before the Committee at all. The Institute of Architects did petition, but no appearance was put in in support of the petition. The hon. Member for Leicester (Mr. Picton) cross-examined the witnesses in order to prove his contention, but he completely failed; and it was shown that the removal of the church will be of material advantage to the inhabitants of the parish. I am afraid that the Motion to reject the Bill is to be attributed to that bitter opposition to improvements in the Church of England of which we had a signal instance yesterday afternoon. I hope that all fair-minded Members of the House will combine to resist the opposition offered to this Bill.
 DR. TANKER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been directed to the alleged grievances of schoolmasters employed in convict prisons as regards classification; whether many of these schoolmasters, who have served for from 15 to 18 years, will be compulsorily retired before reaching the maximum pay of £200 a year; whether many of these men came into the service with the same qualifications, and whether the proportion of first to second-class men as fixed by a Treasury Minute is ignored; and if any steps will be taken to remedy the grievances complained of?
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE  (Carnarvon,  : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether, in prosecuting the inquiry he has promised to make into the royalties charged upon Crown quarries in Carnarvonshire, he will give directions that Mr. Forster Brown shall investigate the grievances of the quarry owners by paying a visit to the quarries in question; and whether he will also give instructions that notice shall be given to the quarry owners interested in the inquiry of the date of such visit, in order to afford them an opportunity of laying their case before the Crown Surveyor?
 SIR R. WEBSTER : In answer to the hon. Member, I beg to say that I have already expressed my opinion upon this matter in reply to a question put to me
 927 "So far as I am personally concerned, Mr. Cobb must have framed his question either without any inquiry at all, or he must have been guided by some very unreliable and incorrect information, for, as a matter of fact, I have not practised in any of my father's courts for 11 years. It seems to me that I have a right to complain that Mr. Cobb has thus used my name in the House of Commons without having had the courtesy to ask me if his information (if any) was correct, and without having taken the trouble to make inquiries, either of my father or of any well-known firms of solicitors in Bristol."
 MR. A. STAVELEY HILL  (Staffordshire, Kingswinford) : May I ask the Attorney General whether he has not received from a member of the Oxford Circuit, who was also named in the question, a denial of the accuracy of the statement?
 SIR R. WEBSTER : With regard to Mr. Kettle, I think it right to state that some time ago that learned gentleman did consult me upon the subject of practising in his father's Court, and, on my suggestion, that gentleman has also given up such practice. That information, also, the hon. Member might have obtained had he thought fit to make inquiry.
 SIR R. WEBSTER : I have no knowledge of the circumstances of those cases, and no representation of any kind has been made to me with regard to any of those gentlemen.
 MR. T. M. HEALT : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland has his attention been called to the resolution of the County Long ford National Teachers' Association, representing that the annual sum given by the Treasury towards retiring gratuities to Irish teachers before the establishment of the pension fund (which is entirely an Irish fund) should be given annually to the pension authorities, so as to enable them to shorten the period of service for pension; and what are the intentions of the Government on the subject?
 MR. T. M. HEALT : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether the mail car, which has been plying for many years between Tinahely and Kiltegan, County Wicklow, is about to be discontinued; and has he received a Memorial from the chief inhabitants of the district, pointing out the inconvenience likely to arise by the contemplated change?
 MR. FLTNN : I had intended to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether, under the Local Registration of Titles (Ireland) Bill, parties are bound to register all dealings relative to land with the Clerks of the Crown and
 932 London Gazette
 SIR R. WEBSTER : The powers of a County Grand Jury in England are limited to the making of presentments for offences and the inquiring into bills of indictment submitted to them, and do not extend to the making of a rate, as suggested in the hon. Member's question, for compensation to injured constables.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member is now going outside the Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Gentleman is entering into the question of the appropriation of additional grants, which is outside the Vote.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : I have some doubts as to whether the training colleges are the best colleges for training teachers. You want training colleges where you can get teaching of a particular character. My objection is not to the colleges, but to their sectarian character. I object to enormous endowments being given over to the Churches. It is not right that they should be given over in this way, and you cannot expect under such a system the same efficiency that you would have if you had a national system.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The discussion of the Bill now is not permissible.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The intention of the Government has been stated, but it would not be in order to discuss the question.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It would not be in order to discuss the question at all.
 THE CHAIRMAN : This discussion is quite irregular.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. and gallant Gentleman must confine himself to matters pertinent to the Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! It does not seem to me that this case has anything to do with the Vote.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The hon. Member is quite in order.
 THE CHAIRMAN : The inconvenience of putting that Motion will be that it will be impossible to answer the second question, but the right hon. Gentleman may reply at once.
(12.43.)  COLONEL NOLAN : There is a considerable sum down here for
 1014
 COLONEL NOLAN : I wish to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether he can give any information as to the system under which country patients are selected for admission to Dublin hospitals?
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE  (Carnarvon,  : I wish to ask whether the Historical Manuscripts Commission cannot investigate Welsh manuscripts as well as Irish and Scotch. The right hon. Gentleman has been good enough to promise that if some of these MS. were brought to his notice he would lay the matter before the Commission. I understand that he gave the same promise to the hon. Member for Merioneth some years ago, I would press him to say whether he will not take steps to have these important Welsh MS. published?
 COLONEL NOLAN : I can assure the hon. Member that there is a very moderate amount of racing in Ireland, and that there is a very small amount of betting, although almost everyone takes an interest in the amusement which racing affords. So far as the officers of the English garrison are concerned, I doubt very much whether any of them are the owners of racehorses; they may own steeplechasers, but the Queen's Plates are not given for steeplechasing. The amount given is a very moderate one, namely, £1,800; and if it were withdrawn it might have the effect of destroying the best class of racing which takes place in Ireland, and thus tend to deteriorate the breed of horses.
 COLONEL NOLAN : We are sent here to look after Supply, and it is a perfect farce to expect us to take Votes like these at this hour. We might just as well be asked to take them all. Surely such Votes ought to be postponed for a day.
 COLONEL NOLAN : I hope the hon. Member will repeat his complaint, because there has been so much noise in the House that though I am anxious to understand it I have been unable to do so. I think that the whole British nation should be made aware of the manner in which the business of the country is being done.
(2.51)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS : The Committee might have had this Vote some time ago if hon. Members opposite had listened to the hon. Member for the St. Rollox Division. I cannot but express indignation when I find that hon. Members opposite refuse to hear a Member on this side of the House and compel him to move to report Progress.
 THE CHAIRMAN : It is not necessary to move that in order to obtain a reply. The hon. Member has stated his case, and now it can be answered.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! The hon. Member's observations are in no way relative to transports and remounts.
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order!
 COLONEL NOLAN : Is the bread now supplied good?
 COLONEL NOLAN : I should like to call the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the bursting of a 6-in gun the other day in Australia. I find that, instead of the new powder, what is called the brown powder was used, and that that powder is very liable to deterioration in certain climates. If the bursting of the gun was caused by the deterioration of this powder, of course it was not due to any fault in the gun. I am not aware whether this brown powder is liable to explode in this way, and I should like the right hon. Gentleman to furnish some information upon the point cither to-night or to-morrow.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Baron H. de WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth) : The statements in the first question are substantially correct; but with reference to one part of it I may state that Mr. Harris, of the Colonial Department, who was thoroughly acquainted with the case, was instructed by the Secretary of State to appear, and did appear, on behalf of the Colonial Government, and that the arbitrators did not think it necessary to hear witnesses. The award of the arbitrators cannot be re-opened, and the Secretary of State cannot undertake to submit the proceedings to persons not connected with the Government or Legislature. Questions 3, 4, and 5 were answered in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for the Oswestry Division yesterday. Her Majesty's Government are not able to entertain the suggestion that the Constitution, repealed for strong reasons in 1870, should now be revived, or that the present Constitution should be otherwise materially altered; but they are willing to consider whether in certain cases the unofficial members may not have an increased power of giving effect to their views, and the new Governor has been instructed accordingly.
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board if his attention has been directed to the great number of instances in which lemonade has been proved by analysis to have been poisonously contaminated by lead; and whether further steps will be taken to prevent danger to the public in this regard?
 DR. TANNER : Has the right hon. Gentleman seen any Reports from Aberdeen calling attention to cases which have been tested, and which showed that in many instances the lemonade had been poisonously contaminated by lead?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether any Government assistance will be afforded the Clonakilty and Rosscarbery Extension Railway; whether a deputation from the district in question, who went to Dublin and had an interview with the Under Secretary, Sir W. Ridge way, were informed by him that their request would receive every consideration; whether a similar assurance was given by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at Skibbereen to another deputation on the same proposed railway; and whether, having regard to the benefit of the large fishing and agricultural interests in the district, the Government will give material assistance to the work?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ire-land whether he has received a Memorial from the inhabitants of Glengarriffe, including two Justices of the Peace and the Protestant Rector, praying that the road now in course of construction at Firkale may be continued until it is connected with the Bocarna Road, a distance of 200 yards; and if on inquiry he is satisfied that this road will be a great boon to the people of Muera, Bocarna, and Firkale, he will grant the prayer of the memorialists?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland, in the case of Constable Courtney, who was recently awarded by the Grand Jury of County Cork £1,000 compensation for injuries inflicted on him by Militiamen, whether the cesspayers of the County of Cork were responsible at law for damage committed in an assault by members of Her Majesty's Forces; and whether the assault in question was committed by Militiamen belonging to another county?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether steps have been yet taken to admit the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway Company as a party under the arrangements of "The Post Office (Parcels) Act, 1882;" and, if not, will he state on what grounds?
 DR. TANNER : May I ask why the reply to this question has been so long delayed, and whether there has been a correspondence between the Post Office and the Railway Clearing House on the subject?
 DR. TANNER : As it is an important matter to the town of Macroom, will the right hon. Gentleman secure the advantages which the district wants?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether the Civil Service messengers and porters are now allowed extra pay for overtime work; and whether, in the case of the Irish messengers and porters, they will be allowed the maximum rate of pay per day from the date the seven hours' system came into force?
 DR. TANNER : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether the cesspayers of a county in England could be obliged by law, by order of the County Grand Jury, to pay compensation to a constable or peace officer who had been maimed or received injuries while in prosecution of his duty from Militiamen members of Her Majesty's Forces, and belonging to another county?
 MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND : There are certain grants given on the results of individual examinations in Standard VI.
(6.40.)  MR. ANGUS SUTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I have not the enthusiasm for private schools possessed by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Rollox. I do not suppose they are animated by the disinterested motives which my hon.
 958
 MR. MUNDELLA : I had hoped to speak upon the Amendment, but if it is for the convenience of the House I will not take advantage of the opportunity.
 MR. MUNDELLA  (Sheffield, Brightside) : I know from my own experience that there have been a good many precedents in this matter. If the right hon. Gentleman will look them up he will find that severe remonstrances have been addressed to Inspectors in times past for taking a more or less prominent part at political functions.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I understand that the Magistrate mentioned did, in the exercise of his discretion, decline to take the information, but he at once communicated with the local constabulary officer, who took steps to increase the extra force of police already ordered. The Magistrate does not appear to have declared the intention attributed to him, nor did he, as a matter of fact, lead the procession. A disturbance did take place, in which it is represented the processionists were not the aggressors, but as the case is  sub judice
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will address a question to my right hon. Friend the Attorney General, or put it on the Paper. I cannot answer it off-hand.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The statement that he led the procession does not accord with the information I have received.
(8.8.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : The first point raised by the hon. Gentleman relates to the salaries of the teachers in Ireland. That matter has often occupied the attention of the Irish Members, and successive Governments have endeavoured to deal with it. The great difficulty in dealing with it has always been as to the provision of more money to improve the position of the teachers, who already, however, get more in proportion than is given to the teachers of the same class in England and Scotland. But I am very glad to be able to say that the present Government were enabled to give a large sum of money last year for increasing the salaries of the teachers—£78,000. And the money
 975 976
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The danger is this. There are many men quite capable of passing the examination and becoming teachers who will not take the trouble to do so unless the assistant teacherships are made very much less remunerative. I will, however, consult with my advisers
 977 978 979
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I understand that the relief works referred to by the hon. Gentleman have been finished today, or will be finished to-morrow, up to the point to which it is thought necessary to finish it.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Application for assistance has been received by the Government, but the Government have no money available, nor would they feel justified, at the present time, in making an advance.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I must ask the hon. Member to defer the question. I have not yet received a Report.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : My attention had not been called to this case until I received the report which the hon. Gentleman was good enough to forward to me. There is no rule of the Local Government Board of the nature indicated in the question.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : That is quite true, and no doubt there is an order which prohibits servants of the Crown and Inspectors of Schools from taking part in political demonstrations. The hon. Gentleman will see, however, that the gentleman mentioned in the question is a servant not of the Crown but of the union, and I believe that no rule has been laid down in such a case. On the contrary, in all parts of Ireland these gentlemen have, from time to time, attended meetings of this kind.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR  said: The clerks of some of the southern unions in Ireland have been very violent partizans.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : My attention has not been called to the particular resolution mentioned, but I may say in regard to the matter generally that the old system referred to, whereby the Treasury sanctioned small sums as retiring allowances in particular cases of national school teachers, was superseded by the Act of 1879, which considerably improved the position of teachers with regard to pension, and provided for the fund a capital sum of £1,300,000 from the Irish Church surplus, the former Treasury contributions being thereupon abolished.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I have sent over to Ireland for a Report, but it has not yet been received, and until I get it I cannot answer the question.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The ease of the teacher mentioned has been before the Commissioners of National Education, who, however, were precluded from coming to an early determination owing to circumstances adversely affecting the

 THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. Balfour,  Manchester, E.) : The General Prisons Board report that Irish prison officers are obliged to wear their uniform when off duty, but not under the special penalty of dismissal. This order has been in existence since February, 1879, soon after the establishment of the General Prisons Board. There have been a few cases in which prison officers have come into collision with persons outside, but in no case have the results been at all serious; nor is there any evidence that they were due to the officers being in uniform, while it is manifest that any officer can be easily recognised in the locality to which he belongs, whether in or out of uniform. The Board do not believe that the wearing of uniform is a source of danger. They have always been ready to permit in individual cases, where reasonable grounds are assigned, officers to wear plain clothes, but from an administrative point of view they cannot recommend a rescission of the order.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I am afraid that I cannot answer that question. There is a difference, and I will endeavour to find out what it is, and what is the reason for it?
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The question of the selection of country patients for treatment in the Dublin hospitals is not one with which the Chief Secretary can deal. The matter is in no way under his control. Possibly the Treasury might interfere, but I am not sure. The subject adverted to by the hon. Member for West Belfast calls unquestionably for attention, but it cannot be dealt with without exciting a great deal of controversy, as the interests involved are various and opposed. Until some agreement can be come to on the subject in Dublin itself, I fear that it will be useless for us to attempt to legislate with reference to it in this House. This may not be a satisfactory answer, but the hon. Member is as familiar as I am with Parliamentary Business, and he must see that legislation on such a subject as this would be impossible without a general concurrence.
(11.30.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The case to which the hon. Member (Mr. Rentoul) has drawn attention is acknowledged to be one of great hardship, but it is also acknowledged that it would be very difficult for any Government to deal with it. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for North Longford (Mr. T. M. Healy) has raised certain questions about the appointment of professors to the Queen's Colleges. The
 1001
(10.47.)  MR. A. J. BALFOUR : I certainly agree with the spirit which has animated the hon. and learned Gentleman in the remarks he has just made, and I must express my hearty concurrence with the general sentiments he has expressed. For grammar I have a respectful toleration, and for spelling a hearty aversion. As far as music is concerned, my own opinion is that the more music is taught in the primary schools, not of Ireland only, but of England and Scotland too, the more brightness shall we introduce into the lives of the people. With regard to the books used in the primary schools, I desire to supply an omission in my earlier speech by stating that I understand the books are at this time undergoing careful revision—["By whom?"]—by the authorities of the Board; and I have no doubt that many of the defects that have been adverted to will be removed. The statement that Irish history ought to be more largely taught

 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Certainly; the Bill will not be proceeded with; but I am not sure whether the Motion will be made to-night for the discharge of the Order. As to the Christian Brothers, I believe I am right in saying that the essential point of difference—the around of separation—at this moment has relation to the use of symbols.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : The intention is to entrust the work to Sir J. B. Green.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Yes; but the worst attendance is in towns.
 MR. SPEAKER : Then the Return cannot be moved now.
(6.54.)  MR. C. S. PARKER  (Perth) : I think the Government may be congratulated on the Debate on the Education Estimates. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not consider it a left-handed compliment to his speech if I say that it seemed to me as good an education speech as even the people of Scotland could have expected to have compressed into the space of ten minutes. In these matters Scotland, from her history, has perhaps given the lead to England. As regards free education, we know, of course, that it has been so; but on this question of free education in Scotland, I could have wished that the Report had given us a little more light and leading than I find in it. My hon. Friend mentioned the number of 38,000 as the number of school seats in excess of the demands of the population, but he also pointed to a table which seems to show that a very different result might be obtained—Table 9 in the Report. That Table shews that the average attendance is 517,738 out of a population of 728,340, leaving a difference of about 150,000. We have an additional £300,000 of expenditure in Scotland, and we naturally look for some educational results there from, and certainly the chief result appears to have been the increased attendance of children. There has been a complaint that Scotland does not equal England in the attendance of infant children, and I certainly think that if the former country is beginning to get hold of the neglected classes at an earlier age, thus being able to subject them to a salutary and beneficent discipline, a real and distinct gain will accrue to the community. Then we have the fact of the falling off in the higher standards. I do not think the School Boards are altogether responsible in this matter; but, on the other hand, I do not think it well that the whole responsibility should be thrown upon the Central Department. I think there are ways in which the Department could encourage the attendance in the higher standards. The Department might say that if the pupils passed before the age of 13, they should not be allowed to go to work, and so lost to the school at the most profitable age; the Department might say that

 *MR. RITCHIE : No, Sir; I have not soon any such Reports, and I am afraid that an Aberdeen complaint would not be addressed to my Department.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : My attention has not been directed to cases of poisonous contamination of lemonade by lead, but I shall be happy to consider carefully any representations which may be made to me on the subject.
 *MR. RITCHIE : All I can say, in answer to the hon. Member, is that I shall be glad to inquire of the Commissioners whether, and, if so, when, it is likely they will appoint Sub-Commissioners, and in that case I will take care that the name of the gentleman referred to shall be again submitted to them.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : I can assure the hon. Member that no one is more anxious than I am to receive the Report of the Commission. A great deal of evidence has been taken, and there is still much more to receive. The matter is a very large one, embracing points of great difficulty, and I can give no information as to when the Report will be made. That is a matter entirely in the hands of the Commission themselves.
*(1.0.)  MR. RITCHIE : It is quite true that I did suggest to the hon. Member that in the course of the inquiry it would be necessary that Sub-Commissioners should be appointed, and that the name of the gentleman mentioned by the hon. Member should be submitted. Having found that that gentleman was, as the hon. Member has stated, a man of great ability, and well fitted to take a post such as that which was the subject of discussion, this gentleman's name was submitted, but I understand that no Sub-Commissioner has yet been appointed; and as far as the appointment of Sub-Commissioners is concerned, that is a matter which rests entirely with the Royal Commission, by whom the initiative has to be taken. I am afraid I cannot say more than this. What I did say at the time referred to was said in perfectly good faith, and anything I could do in the way of seeing that the name of the gentleman alluded to should be favourably put forward has been done, but the Government have no power whatever over the Commission in regard to this matter.
 MR. CRILLY  (Mayo, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that on Sunday, the 12th of July, Mr. D. Dunn, P.L.G., of Rostrevor, County Down, accompanied by another ratepayer of the same place, waited on Mr. Horner, J.P., to swear an informa
 936
 MR. CRILLY : Do I understand the right hon. Gentleman to say that, notwithstanding the reports in the public papers, this man was not at the head of the procession?
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I have a Motion on the Paper affecting the Army Vote on which I shall have to raise a
 1024
(3.24.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I have several points to raise on this Vote, but shall postpone them until the Report stage, if I am given to understand that by the withdrawal of the Clergy Discipline Bill from the Paper we may take it that it has been abandoned.
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I put it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it would not be well for him to consent to postpone such Army Votes as are contentious until to-morrow. If he does he will make much better progress with the Votes than he will otherwise. I am sure the refusal of the Government to report Progress will not facilitate matters.
 MR. LLOYD - GEORGE : I support that. I do not think it is possible to get through the Estimates to-night. It is no fault of ours that they have been brought on so late in the Session. The Government are responsible for that piece of bungling. There is one Vote which my colleagues for Wales desire to discuss thoroughly.
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University) : Mr. Pearson's sketch designs, referred to in the question, were prepared by him for the Royal Commission on Westminster Abbey, on the understanding that they should be treated as confidential, and the evidence mentioned in the question was given in explanation of those designs at a time when the general evidence had been long closed, and the Commissioners were actually engaged in considering their final Report; and when, therefore, no reporter was present. Under these circumstances, we could not publish these designs or the evidence in explanation of them with our Report. I have, of course, no power whatever now to add anything to that Report. I need hardly say that I should have no objection to Mr. Pearson's publishing these sketch plans in any way, and with any explanations he chooses, should he wish to do so. As to the last part of the question, the only design in relation to the refectory site prepared by Mr. Pearson was one suggesting a possible treatment of the interior; no such design was made by Mr. Pearson for the proposed monumental chapel at the south-east corner of the Abbey.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : So far as the Irish Government are concerned, it is an unopposed Return.
 MR. MADDEN : I can hardly answer that question.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : The Grand Jury of the County Cork, in making an award of compensation to Constable Courtney for injuries inflicted on him by Militiamen, were acting under their statutable powers. If any section of the ratepayers felt aggrieved it was open to them to traverse the presentment before the Assize Judge. I understand that, as a matter of fact, the Militiamen did belong to another county.
 MR. CRAWFORD : I know that there are other points to be discussed by hon. Members around me, and I will not pursue the matter further.
(6.0.)  MR. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : I think the Report of the Department, and the exposition of it by the Lord Advocate, have been most satisfactory. We are accustomed to have satisfactory statements on this subject, and I think the Scottish nation regard the experiment that they have made in the way of national education as one that has borne, and continues to bear, a rich fruit. It may be that there is anxiety as to the early age at which children are withdrawn, but I have no doubt that some effort will be made to meet that. The point to which I wish to draw the Lord Advocate's attention refers to technical and intermediate education. I think the State, so far as it can exercise its function, is now called upon to frame a policy with regard to intermediate education. It appears from the Report that, as regards technical instruction, not very much has yet been done by the School Boards, who are the agents for disseminating it under the Act of 1887. That Act does not place us so favourably as England is placed by the English Act passed two years later, when County Councils were established, and which enabled the framers of the English Act to take advantage of those bodies for the administration of technical education. With regard to secondary education, the Report points out that it is in many respects weak, and that such schools as exist have many difficulties to struggle with, and that the struggle is not maintained with particular success. Everyone who knows anything of Scotland will confirm that view. As a link between the elementary school and the University, secondary education lacks vitality and energy. We shall have a large sum at the disposal of the country next year, and there will be many claims upon it.
 954
 MR. CRAWFORD : The Report of the Department divides the subject into technical and intermediate education, and, differing from England, the Department has power to inspect the secondary schools. Under these conditions, may I ask whether I am out of order?
 MR. D. CRAWFORD  (Lanark, N.E.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether, according to the existing rules sanctioned by the Secretary of State, at least a proportion of the three appointments of Presidency Magistrate at Bombay ought to be conferred on natives of India, and that if a European, not being in the Covenanted Service, is appointed, he must have certain special qualifications, and his appointment is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State; whether two of these appointments are now held by Europeans, and the third is vacant; whether there are native gentlemen qualified to fill the vacancy; whether Mr. Webb, proposed by the Bombay Government, possesses the qualifications required by the rules; and whether the Secretary of State will decline to confirm the nomination, and insist on a native being appointed?
 *MR. D. CRAWFORD : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether there were not instructions by the Secretary of State, following upon the Report of the Public Service Commission, in which it was laid down that such appointments can be conferred on a European, not being a member of the Covenanted Service only, if he is a member of the Bar and acquainted with the language of the country; and whether Mr. Webb possesses either of those qualifications?
 MR. KNOX : I should like to ask how it is that steamers from Belfast to Fleetwood carry mails, whilst steamers from Liverpool to Belfast do not. The Belfast and Liverpool boats are owned by an Irish Company, whilst the Belfast and Fleetwood boats belong to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company.
(3.5.)  MR. KNOX : There are a large number of matters on this Vote that I wished to call attention to in connection with my constituency, and I will reserve all of them but one to the Report stage if I get a satisfactory answer upon that. I called attention to the matter the other day, but instead of getting a civil answer from the Postmaster General, he said something about my being interested in the appointment of someone, or applying for the appointment of someone to the office of Postmaster at Cavan. As a matter of fact, I have never applied, and I never intend to apply, to him, or anyone else in the British Government, for any post for anyone. Although the right hon. Gentleman refused to give me an answer, I have received information from other people on this matter. Letters have been written to me stating that the office of Postmaster has been bestowed upon a person, not out of regard for qualification or fitness. This post office is an important one, in the centre of a large rural district, and the number of people under the Postmaster is considerable. There were 35 applicants for the post. Some of them had been for 20 years in the postal service. Many of them had had 15 years' experience of post office work, and others had had 10 years' experience. Nevertheless, the person appointed had had only three years' experience. The person appointed, however, had an advantage that the others had not. It happened that her father was a henchman of the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for North
 1032
(3.15.)  MR. KNOX : The right hon. Gentleman has given a perfectly satisfactory answer as to the post office at Strabane, but at the same time I am bound to say that I have received such a large number of letters from members of the Post Office Service, as well as outsiders in different parts of Ireland, that I think if other appointments like that at Cavan had been made the dissatisfaction would have been general. I am glad to find that though the hon. Member for North Armagh succeeded in getting his nominee appointed at Cavan, his policy has not succeeded in the case of Strabane.
*(10.5.)  MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : One matter referred to by the hon. and gallant Gentleman is worthy of serious consideration—that of the Christian Brothers. There is no Religious Order in the world which commends itself so much to every class as the Christian Brothers, especially those in Ireland.
 988 989
 *MR. KNOX : Then, I will say we shall have further speeches from gentlemen who expressed views of antiquated bigotry last night. I refer to such Members as the hon. Member for Camberwell (Mr. Kelly) and the hon. Member for South Tyrone (Mr. T. W. Russell). It is understood that the reason why this action is to be taken, if possible, to enforce compulsory education in Ireland is that a certain sum will be available next year for the increase of the salaries of the national teachers corresponding to the decrease in their present income owing to the abolition of fees. Of course there are foes in the country districts as well as in the towns, and I should like an assurance from the right hon. Gentleman that he does not intend the abolition of fees to apply only to districts where compulsion is enforced. It is in remote country districts that the teachers at present lead such a severe life. There are an extraordinary number of them who receive less than £1 a week, and who have to eke out their livelihood by getting their wives to keep shops and by occupying themselves with business outside the work of teaching which seriously interferes with their efficiency. The right hon. Gentleman has stated that it will be impossible next year to introduce the principle of election in the Education Board. That may be so, but the right hon. Gentleman might to a great extent improve its composition by making the Catholic portion of it more representative of the feelings of the majority of the people. At present the Catholic portion are not in accord with the views of the Representatives for Ireland in this House, and I cannot think that that is a natural state of things. Without introducing the principle of election, it would be possible, as vacancies arise, to make this Board more in accordance with the feelings of the people. With regard to the books used in the elementary schools in Ireland, the right hon. Gentleman did not seem to understand how ridiculous the position is, and seemed to think that it was possible for the school managers to use what books they liked. That, as a matter of fact, is not the case. The rules of the
 990 991
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : I would appeal to my hon. Friend to withdraw his Motion. It seems to me there is some difference between the hon. Gentleman and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be good enough to say what he thinks the hon. Gentleman means. [ Laughter
(1.47.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON : I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will not resist the Motion. I am as much disappointed as he is that the Business of Supply cannot be closed tonight, but I protest against the Votes being discussed at this hour of the night, and hope he will not force a futile Debate on this Motion.
(1.36.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON : I should like to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will now agree to report Progress?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : I see there are 13 or 14 Government Orders down after Report of Supply. Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake, if Supply is closed, not to press those Orders?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : Does the President of the Board of Agriculture intend to take the Markets and Fairs Bill?
(6.48.)  MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I wish to call attention to the question of the training colleges of Scotland. It has been my custom for some years past to take a Division upon this question; but I shall not upon this occasion, in the absence of so many Members for Scotland, put the House to the trouble of a Division, which would afford no true indication of the real opinion of the Scottish people on this subject. The Report of the Committee of Council, as usual, contains an allusion to this subject, which is in the nature of an excuse, and, therefore, being an excuse, is a condemnation of the system of management. It says that, although these colleges are denominational, it is but little more than in name, and that they are conducted with the utmost care, so as to respect any differences in religious views. We depend upon these Colleges for the supply of schoolmasters in Scotland; and even though they are denominational but in name, still that very fact is evidence of the necessity for some reform. I wish the Lord Advocate and the Department to take heart of grace, and declare that these institutions, which almost entirely depend upon public support, should cease to be denominational, even in name. Many of us object to the training of public schoolmasters being divorced from the more liberal culture of the Universities. We hold that the benefit of the Universities should be extended to the rising generation of schoolmasters. I do not know what is the exact position of this question, and whether or not it is in the hands of the Commission. The subject has been before the Government in one shape or other for a very considerable time, and I suppose you have, at all events, some University institution to which a portion of the rising generation of schoolmasters might be drafted. Possibly, the University of Aberdeen and other Universities might be invited to take charge of part of the work of training the schoolmasters of the public elementary schools of Scotland. I hope the Lord Advocate will give us what information he possesses upon the subject, because I feel sure it is a matter of the greatest interest to the people of Scotland and to all who are concerned in the work of education.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he has seen the statement in the  Times 921
 MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I think the Business of the House would be facilitated if it were arranged that those Votes which are to be discussed on Report were taken first to-morrow.
 MR. MARJORIBANKS : I appeal to my hon. Friends to allow the Votes to go through and to take any discussion on Report. The House is wearied out, and the Gallery is also wearied out.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I can tell the hon. and gallant Gentleman that, so far
 1038
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of this question, and I may tell him at once that we do not have any large amount of steel forging in the Arsenal, where steel is only manufactured on a very small scale. That being so, it is not desirable to employ in the manufacture of our steel persons of the same position and experience as have to be employed by the private firms who manufacture this kind of steel on a much larger scale.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle) : No complaints have been made to me, but after the question of the hon. Member I will make inquiries.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I remember the question to which the hon. Member refers having been raised, but according to the information I have upon the subject, it appears that if the gentleman referred to has any claim at all, it is rather against the company than against the Government.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I will undertake to look into the matter, but the facts are not exactly as they have been stated by the hon. Member.
 MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON  (Tower Hamlets, Stepney) : As this is the only time one can obtain any information with regard to Egypt, I should be glad to hear the reason why the Domain Loan has not been converted on the same advantageous lines as the Egyptian Privilege Loan?
 MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON : May I ask if the whole of these financial arrangements are really in the hands of Messrs. Rothschild?
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : Yes.
(1.54.)  MR. GOSCHEN : The Government have the cordial support of those who lead hon. Gentlemen opposite in their endeavours to close the Session. There will be to-morrow a full day for the discussion of the Report, and I believe we are following the wishes of the enormous majority of the House in endeavouring to close Supply to-night, and I shall certainly take the opinion of the House by dividing against the Motion.
 MR. GOSCHEN  was understood to say that, following the recent decision of the House of Lords as to the liability of charities to Income Tax, a refund had already been made, and would probably be succeeded by other repayments.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I hope the hon. Member has almost concluded his speech. If he will do so now no doubt the Committee will bear with him, but I think it will be acknowledged that cause has been given for some little impatience.
(3.0.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I do not see that I have any further reply to make. Instead of speaking three minutes, as he promised, the hon. Member has spoken for 35 minutes. I should not be doing my duty if I were to allow myself to be guided merely by the length of the speech of an hon. Member. I cannot allow myself to be coerced into giving a wider answer than I have given already, namely, that the Treasury will loyally carry out the decision of the Court. The result of my having
 1031
(2.45.)  MR. GOSCHEN : I would suggest that the hon. Gentleman has been allowed a very long time to state his case, and has repeated himself three or four times. I think he has said enough to do justice to his case, and I hope he will withdraw the Motion. I think everyone here understands his complaint—he has said ample to convey his views both to my mind and that of the Committee. He must allow for a little impatience if he repeats his argument two or three times over. He has said his say, and I hope he will withdraw his Motion.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I do not think that is precisely the way in which a question should be put. I will make a statement with regard to the Bill tomorrow—though we do not intend to proceed with it to-morrow.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I will lay the right hon. Gentleman's views before the First Lord of the Treasury.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I hope Supply will be closed.
 MR. GOSCHEN : The point is this: Unless we finish Supply to-night it will probably throw the Prorogation over to another week, and we all desire it should take place next week. Surely it does not much matter to hon. Members whether they make their protest to-night or to-morrow on Report. I trust they will bow to the views of the majority. If it is possible to give precedence tomorrow to the Votes which hon. Members desire particularly to discuss, it shall be done.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I will look through the list in the course of the next four or five minutes, and see how far I can assent to that arrangement. We do not want to keep hon. Members and officers of the House here one minute longer than is necessary.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I believe there is a general desire on the part of the House that Supply shall be closed. There is an opportunity upon Report of asking
 1023
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : The hon. Member is aware that the intention of the Government to deal with this question was announced in the gracious Speech from the Throne. It has boon impossible to do so owing to the press of other business during the present Session, but the Government have in no way departed from that intention, and my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Agriculture will introduce a Bill on this subject next Session.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I have not altogether abandoned hope of being able to proceed with this Bill.
 MR. GOSCHEN : It has occurred to me that there might be a lengthy discussion under such circumstances, but on the other hand, if the Training Colleges Bill were taken first, Report of Supply might be thrown over to next week, and there would be some reason to complain that the Session is being unduly prolonged.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Yes, Sir; if there is time. It will come on after the Training Colleges Bill.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Dr. Carr, who signed the certificate as to the health of the hon. Member for East Belfast, is a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. I am informed that he also holds a qualification for the practice of medicine in Prance.
 MR. GOSCHEN : A communication was made to me by a right hon. Gentleman opposite, who represents a Scotch constituency, to the effect that I might take it for granted, as far as he had been able to ascertain, that the Scotch Members were quite in accord with the policy of postponing this matter until next Session. I have, however, received a telegram from one town in Scotland expressing disappointment at the postponement, but I am not sure whether that disappointment does not rest upon a misapprehension. It is stated in the telegram to which I have referred that they are afraid that the payment of the grant which they had anticipated will be postponed until next year. The House will remember that, although postponed now, it is perfectly

 MR. GOSCHEN : With reference to the last question of the right hon. Gentle
 939
 MR. GOSCHEN : I thought I said that on Monday we shall take the Second Reading, on the hypothesis that we finish the Report of Supply on Saturday. That would be the first business, and then we should take the Lords' Amendments to several Bills. I hope we may be able on Monday to deal with the Lords' Amendment to the Education Bill; and I will endeavour to secure that due notice is given of the precise manner in which we shall propose to deal with it.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I quite understand that we cannot amend the Lords' Amendment but must negative the whole clause. The question is whether, having negatived it, we can send up to the Lords an alternative clause. ["No, no,"  from the Opposition
 MR. GOSCHEN : The House will meet at 12 o'clock, but I am afraid that I cannot fix an hour for the termination of the business. Sometimes it does not facilitate early business if an hour is fixed for rising.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I am afraid that I cannot answer the last question; I must
 942
 MR. GOSCHEN : No; it will not be taken to-night. In reply to the hon. Member for West Belfast I may point out that Report of Supply does not usually take much time, and it is essential we should get it this week, if the Prorogation is to take place next week.
 MR. MORRELL  (Oxford, Woodstock) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he will consent to make arrangements for the delivery of telegrams without charge within the present boundaries of the City of Oxford?
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I presume that the Report of Supply will be taken first, and if an announcement to that effect is made, I think it may facilitate the discussion of Supply to-night. I am afraid that the Post Office Vote cannot come on until very late.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether he will lay before the House the designs which Mr. Pearson, R.A., prepared for the Royal Commission on Westminster Abbey for a monumental chapel or annexe to the Abbey on the site of the houses in Old Palace Yard, and also the evidence which, from a recent statement in the  Times
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : There is one important Vote—the Post Office Vote—to be taken. For my part, I shall be content to defer my remarks upon it until the Report stage. I hope next Session we shall have an opportunity of thoroughly discussing it, even if it be necessary to bring it on out of its order.
 MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : May I venture to mention another newspaper rumour, stating that the mission to Roumania is to be raised to a first-class mission, and that the salary of the Minister is to be raised from £2,500 to £5,000. I wish to know whether there is any truth in the rumour, and whether any Supplementary Estimate is to be presented. The right hon. Gentleman will, I think, have some difficulty in convincing the Committee of the necessity of this increased charge.
(1.10.)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. CHAPLIN,  Lincolnshire, Sleaford) : I have a perfect recollection of the circumstances referred to by the hon. Member opposite, and I remember the recommendation given to the name of the gentleman to whom reference has been made; but as far as my recollection goes, the Commission had at that time already been appointed. It was, I think, believed, both by the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board and my

 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the Vice President of the Committee of Council on Education whether he is aware that Mr. W. C. G. Milman, Inspector of Schools, on July 22nd, at a grand fête of the Kineton and Ettington Habitations of the Primrose League, held in Chordshunt Park, in Mr. Milman's district, at which the Conservative candidate for the Division was present, took a prominent part in a pastoral operetta, and that after the operetta he attended a political meeting held in the grounds; and whether he will call Mr. Milman's attention to the Order of the Lord President of the Council of January, 1880, prohibiting the official staff of the Education Department from taking an active part at political meetings, and request him to refrain in the future from doing so?
 MR. COBB : May I ask, for the guidance of people in the future, whether it is to be understood that although these gentlemen may not attend or take an active part in political meetings, they may yet take an active part in the entertainments of the Primrose League?
 MR. COBB : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury who are the parties to the contract for supplying refreshments
 919
 *MR. COBB : I do wish it, as a representation would come with greater weight from the right hon. Gentleman. I may inform the right hon. Gentleman that he is wrong about members of the legal profession and habits of intemperance.
 MR. COBB  had upon the Paper the following Question:—To ask the Attorney General whether the custom of barristers practising in County Courts where their fathers are Judges, and having professional chambers in or adjoining the district of such Courts, is in accordance with the traditions and etiquette of the Bar; whether he is aware that Mr. T. E. Ellison, of the North Eastern Circuit, has his professional chambers at Sheffield, and practises in his father's Court, and that the Registrar and Deputy Registrar of the Court at Sheffield are uncle and cousin to Mr. Ellison; whether he is aware that Mr. D. M. Metcalfe, of the Western Circuit, has his professional chambers at Bristol, and practises in his father's Court; whether he is aware that Mr. Rupert E. C. Kettle, of the Oxford Circuit, has his professional chambers at Birming ham, and practises in his father's Court, and that the Registrar of the Court at Dndley is Mr. Kettle's brother, and the High Bailiff his brother-in-law; whether he is aware that Mr. Edgar Meynell, of the North Eastern Circuit, has his professional chambers at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and practises in his father's Court: whether he is aware that Mr. E. Honoratus Lloyd and Mr. T. Fitzroy Lloyd, of the North Wales and Chester Circuit, whose professional chambers are in London, practise in their father's Court at Chester; whether he is aware that in these districts there is a feeling among the public and the members of the legal profession that the custom of these barristers practising in their father's Court does not inspire confidence that justice is impartially administered; and whether he will call the attention of these gentlemen to the traditions and etiquette of the Bar, or call the attention of the Lord Chancellor to the facts? The hon. Member said: Before I put this question I wish to withdraw paragraph three, which relates to Mr. Metcalfe, as, since I put the question down, I have been informed that he has not practised in his fathers Court for more than 10 years.
 *MR. COBB : I regret very much having put down Mr. Metcalfe's name, but I may say that I received the information with regard to that gentleman from one of the leading Queen's Counsel on the Western Circuit. [ Cries of
 MR. MATTHEWS : I answered this question on the 14th inst., and I have nothing to add to the answer which I then gave.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I received Petitions from schoolmasters employed in convict prisons. These were considered, and in 1890 I recommended to the Treasury, and they sanctioned, an improved scale of pay to take effect from April 1, 1890, and in order to meet the complaints of slowness of promotion due to the diminished prison population, two special promotions were made to the first-class. All the existing first-class schoolmasters will attain their maximum before reaching the age of compulsory retirement. There is every probability that the three second-class schoolmasters who have served 15 years or more, will, by promotion, be able to obtain the same maximum. The arrangement sanctioned by the Treasury in 1869—namely, that the number of first-class clerks should be two-fifths of the number of second-class clerks—has not been ignored, and is observed at present.
 MR. RAIKES : I will look at the correspondence to which the hon. Member refers, and if I can find anything to justify further action it shall be taken.
 MR. RAIKES : No time has been wasted. No correspondence has reached me.
 MR. RAIKES : The question is really one for the London Railway Clearing Committee, and not for the Post Office. The 9th section of the Post Office (Parcels) Act, 1882, prescribes that Railway Companies shall be parties thereto, and amongst them includes all railways authorised after the passing of the Act. I am informed that the Cork and Muskerry Company's undertaking was authorised by the Tramways Order in Council (Ireland) (Cork, Conchford, and Blarney) Confirmation Act, 1886. I have no knowledge whether the Company named has taken any steps to establish its right to share in the arrangements of the Post Office (Parcels) Act.
 *MR. RAIKES : It has been decided that the day mail car hitherto working from Tinahely to Kiltegan shall be replaced by a ear working from Baltinglass—the object in view being to effect a much desired improvement of postal service at Kiltegan—the distance from Baltinglass to Kiltegan being less than live miles, whereas the distance from Tinahely to Kiltegan is 10 miles. A Memorial against the change was received, but I think it did not originate with the chief residents of Kiltegan, and referred mainly to the question of passenger traffic. The balance of postal advantages was, in my opinion, clearly in favour of the change—the same interval for reply at Hackelstown as at present, namely, two hours live minutes, being maintained.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : I understand that what is desired is that the Receiving Office at St. Clements should be constituted an office for delivery as well as for collection of telegrams. I have had fresh inquiry made into this matter, and I am glad to say that I

 MR. RAIKES : We have no control whatever over the matter of passengers, but only over the mails.
(3.11.)  THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : I do not wish to detain the Committee by answering the questions addressed to me at any length; in fact, I think I have already answered them. I cannot prevent Members of this House—on both sides of this House—and other persons from writing to me and recommending candidates when appointments have to be made, not only in Ireland, but in England as well; but the Committee may rest satisfied that I never allow myself to be influenced by these recommendations. With regard to the lady who was appointed to the Cavan office I may say, in the first place, that I was not aware that her father was what the

(3.20.)  MR. RAIKES : I will inquire as to the Liverpool and Belfast line of steamers, but I must say I do not think it at all probable that another subsidy will be granted to a mail route between England and Belfast, looking at the extremely favourable arrangement we have been able to make with the Fleetwood boats. As to the Strome Ferry steamers. I would point out that in that particular contract it was arranged that on two or three occasions during the year—one of them being the period at which the Militia are called up and have to be conveyed from one place to another—deviations should be made from the main route. I should be sorry if this led to inconvenience, but I would point out that a large subsidy has been allowed in this case, so that larger and more commodious boats may be employed in the Service, and from these circumstances I think the public derive more advantage than is counteracted by the inconvenience to which the hon. Member has referred. The subsidy will come to an end with the year, and when it comes to be renewed we shall then have an opportunity of ascertaining

*(2.20.)  MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : I desire to address a question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to the action of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax. A month or two ago I pointed out that the Income Tax Commissioners were, under the apparent sanction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, refusing to return Income Tax to grammar schools and other charities, which they assert do not come within the exemption allowed by the Act. The House of Lords, in the suit "Commissioners of Income Tax  v
 MR. ROBY  (Lancashire, S.E., Eccles) : I beg to put to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a question of which I have given the Under Secretary for India private notice, and which I believe the right hon. Gentleman is pre-pared to answer. I wish to ask whether, under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1889, it is a criminal offence, punishable with imprisonment or fine, for any person to sell, or expose for sale, sewing cotton with a false description of the number of yards applied thereto, unless he can prove his action to be innocent in the matter, and gives information as to the person from whom he obtained the goods; and whether, if so, the Government will take steps to make this known to dealers in India, and to give aid in the detection and punishment of offenders under this Act?
 MR. ROBY : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he can recommend Her Majesty to release Austin Bid well, who has spent 18 years in prison, having been convicted of forgery in 1873, and sentenced at the age of 25 to penal servitude for life?
(4.50.)  MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : We have in former years had the advantage of a whole sitting for the discussion of the Scotch Educational Estimate, but during the last two years if has been hurried through at the end of the Session without much consideration. I think it is very unfair it the Reports of the Inspectors are not made public at an earlier date. The country ought to have an opportunity of considering those Reports as well as the Report of the Department. The latter Report professes to give a correct idea of the progress of education in Scotland since 1872. The average attendance is given as 213,549 in 1872 and as 512,690 in 1890. The apparent increase is most remarkable, and undoubtedly it is the intention of the Department to convey to the people of Scotland the idea that the attendance has practically increased by 140 per cent. since 1872. But the fact, as pointed out recently in a letter to the  Glasgow Herald 948 949 950 "In large measure to the increased attendance of infants and to the earlier age at which the standard of exemption from attendance is reached." 951 952 953

 MR. CALDWELL : Again I would refer to the conduct of the Lord Advocate. While he will not say a word in reply to me he has been kind and considerate to questions put by every other Member who has spoken on this side of the House, including the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Morton).

(1.50.)  MR. CALDWELL : When we remember how every sitting of the House this week has been prolonged until 3 or 4 o'clock, and that we have to meet again at noon, I think it is most unreasonable on the part of the Government to resist this Vote. A good deal of business has been got through this evening, and there has been no obstruction. Every year the Estimates are postponed to the end of the Session, and then are taken practically without discussion. Now, the Government hope by reason of the sheer exhaustion of hon. Members to get all the remaining Votes through. I do not think it is fair. When the right hon. Gentleman moved the suspension of the Standing Orders, he said it was not intended to make oppressive use of the privilege; but yet he is so unreasonable as to make us sit till 4 or 5 o'clock. I shall support the Motion to report Progress.
 MR. CALDWELL : It does not seem to me that it is more than half-an-hour since I began. The delay has been owing to the fact that I was not allowed to finish my speech.
(2.54.)  MR. CALDWELL : I will now, with the leave of the Committee, shortly and clearly state the point. These Trades House Corporations in Glasgow are 14 in number. The funds of the Corporations are used for the purpose of giving pensions to decayed brethren connected with the Corporations. The funds exist now purely for these charitable objects. It has always been the practice of the Inland Revenue not to charge any Income Tax or Government duty in respect of the funds of these Corporations. Within the last year or two the Government have started a 5 per cent. duty, which is far more than the Income Tax, and have levied that duty upon the funds of these Corporations, and the result is that those pensioners who have been enjoying, say £20 a year, have had £1 deducted. This shows the thorough unreasonableness

 MR. CALDWELL : I desire to call the attention of the Postmaster General to the fact that the mail steamers which ply between Strome Ferry and Stornoway sometimes go out of their way to call at Portree, which causes a considerable delay to the mails and puts the inhabitants of the district to very great inconvenience.
 MR. CALDWELL : The Government have agreed to abandon the Bill in return for being allowed to get Supply. ["No, no!"] Yes; that is the arrangement, and I think the country should know it. The whole of this Supply has been a matter of bargaining, and—
 MR. CALDWELL : I move to report Progress. I think that seeing that we have to meet at 12 o'clock to-day we might now very fairly adjourn. We understood that the Government, on condition of being allowed to get all Supply through to-night, had agreed to abandon the Clergy Discipline Bill. ["No, no!" and  cries of 1036
 MR. FLYNN  (Cork N.) : More than that—30,000.
(10.29.)  MR. FLYNN : As to the Christian Brothers, the hon. Member is under a misconception. Let me inform him that they took up the work of primary education in Ireland 30 years before the National Board was established. The Christian Brothers have been in existence for 90 years, and have now over 78 establishments and between 30,000 and 35,000 pupils attending them. It is acknowledged that the primary education given by that body would be difficult to beat in any part of Great Britain. The

 MR. FLYNN : I am in a position to say that the Christian Brothers are prepared to make very large concessions.

 MR. FLYNN : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the works on the relief road Bohola, County Mayo, are stopped, or about to be stopped: and, in view of the fact that this necessary work is nearly completed, whether the Irish Government will authorise this work to be proceeded with for an additional week or two until it is fully completed?
 MR. FLYNN : Was there not a representation made by the Irish Office to the Secretary for War suggesting the desirability of the War Office paying a portion of the money?
 MR. RENTOUL : I mentioned the matter to the Attorney General for Ireland, and understood that I could bring the case forward. Professor Pye has failed in obtaining a legal remedy, and the only hope of redress lies in bringing the matter before the attention of the Government. I hope we shall hear from the Chief Secretary that he has done something to meet the hardships of this case.
(11.16.)  MR. RENTOUL  (Down, E.) : I wish to call attention to a grievance which has existed since the time of the abolition of Queen's University; and I am sure that my hon. Friend, although he objects to Queen's Colleges root and branch, will bear me out in the statement I am about to make. Queen's Colleges were first opened in the year 1849, and in 1852 they were formed into a University, the professors appointed to the Queen's College becoming professors of Queen's University and examiners for the Royal University. I think my hon. Friend rather understated his case when he complained of the Queen's College professors acting as University examiners. I wish, however, to refer to one particular case of hardship. The case came before the Dublin Courts. It is that of Professor Pye, of Queen's College, who, it so happens, labours under the great disadvantage of being both a Nationalist and a Roman Catholic. He is one of the ablest men in Ireland at the present time. It has been my good fortune, under the Irish system of mixed education, to enjoy his intimate acquaintance. I was a student at the time he took a high and distinguished degree in medicine; he secured a gold medal and first honours, and I believe is the only Doctor of Medicine who was specially complimented by the Lord Lieutenant. Shortly after he applied for and obtained the appointment of Professor of Anatomy at Queen's College, Galway, and although he might have started as a medical man in the town, and secured the first practice, he devoted himself solely to the duties of his professorship. His income ranged from £700 to £800 a year. In 1863 an arrangement was made under which the professors, whose classes were

 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I do not think that is for examinations under the standard; the system has been extended to all the standards. I think the hon.

With regard to the question which came before the Public Accounts Committee, payment will be allowed, after due inquiry, in all cases where the rules that are this year for the first
 964
*(7.36.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON  In reply to the hon. Member I have to say that it would be impossible to disturb the Scotch Education Department to the extent of removing the office from London to Edinburgh. The Minister responsible for Education in Scotland must be in his place in Parliament, and moreover, the whole system of education in Scotland must be very much in touch with Parliament. The Department in Edinburgh is an accountant's office. It is found convenient to maintain this office, but I can assure the hon. Member that it is not a separate establishment performing double work or anything of that kind. As regards the appointments to Scotch Inspectorships, teachers are under no disqualification. The Department choose for these positions men of experience in educational work, and so long as they get efficient teachers the whole field is open.
 MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : Certainly appointments have been made amongst gentlemen engaged in educational work of some kind or other. The Department, however, make it a rule to take the best man wherever he is found. As to the question of training colleges, I do not know whether the hon. Member is fully acquainted with the point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee. The hon. Member adverted to the question of training colleges, but is he alive to the

(4.43.)  THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. J. P. B. ROBERTSON,  Bute) : There is an increase in the Vote as compared with last year of £25,486, due almost entirely to the larger amount given for day and evening scholars. This increase arises in the first place from the higher rate of pay for each scholar, and in the second, from the increase in the aggregate attendance. During the year the rate of pay for each scholar has been 19s. 3¼d., which is the highest point yet reached, and the estimate for next year is no less than 20s. 2d. The progressive advance of the amount earned per scholar since 1873 is striking. In that year it was only 9s. 10¾d., and any stoppage in the increase has been due entirely to the anxiety of the Department in insisting that for each increase in the rate there shall be a corresponding high degree of efficiency. There is an increase in the aggregate attendance from 503,100 to 512,690, and at the present time out of every 100 children of school age in Scotland, 82 are on the register and 63 in daily attendance. The average attendance has been steadily increasing over a course of years. Since 1881, while the population has increased by 8 per cent., the attendance of school children has increased by 25 per cent. The total number of children presented in the higher standards has been smaller this year than in former years, and this is due to the fact that there are now more children who are working to improve themselves in the lower standards, and fewer who are forced up, although unfit, into the higher standards. The total number of presentations, including those under the Third Standard, is 474,873, against 469,518 last year. This increase is largely in the lower standards.

(7.10.)  MR. J. P. B. ROBERTSON : I acknowledge with pleasure the great moderation which hon. Gentlemen have exercised in discussing this Vote, in which they take great interest, and the manner in which they have accommodated the length of their speeches to the time at the disposal of the House. I am sorry my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North East Lanark should have found that this is not the occasion for entering on a subject in which he takes an especial interest; and I do not think I shall go wrong if I say

(6.20.)  MR. J. PARKER SMITH  (Lanark, Partick) : In Scotland we have now had a few years' experience of" free education, and I think it is almost time that the Lord Advocate should say here what effect it is having on attendance and so forth. I hope he will be able to give us in the pages of the Report some account of what is happening in this matter. "We are also entitled to ask how the new Code, which has been in operation for half a year, is working. As to free education, while it is increasing the number of infant children attending the schools, there is an unfortunate diminution in the higher standards. In England the number of children under five years in attendance is 10 per cent. of the whole number of children attending. In Scotland it is less than 2 per cent. That shows a very different state of circumstances. The larger number of children in attendance in Scotland are-between the ages of five and seven—an age when they are capable of admirable discipline, as evidenced in the great schools of Glasgow. But it seems to me a very doubtful expedient to get these children to school between the ages of three and five years. Certainly the unsatisfactory feature of the Report is the diminution in the higher standards. The Inspectors speak of the difficulty of keeping the children at school up to the higher standards. I should like very much to see this point elucidated by figures, and I should like to know whether the Lord Advocate would be willing to give a Return on this point, giving the percentage of children under the age of 10, 12, 14, and 15 who pass the examinations? I believe that a means of checking this diminution in the higher standards would be to give greater elasticity to the new Code, and the Government might: do something to encourage the children to stay longer at school. We have heard that all compulsory education should be free. I do not know whether anybody is pre-

 MR. MCDONALD CAMERON  (Wick Burghs) : I beg to ask the Lord Advocate what is the gross amount of reductions of grant under Article 32 of the Scottish Code during the past three years; for what are these reductions made; whether they have been earned by teachers; whether it is proposed to claim these sums as a contribution to a superannuation fund for teachers; and whether a draft scheme to this end is now being prepared by the Department, and what precedent, if any, is there for such a course.

(9.32.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : The Chief Secretary has hinted at the course he might pursue; he has not positively stated that he will abandon the Training Colleges Bill, but has only said that he may do so. We have refrained from discussing Irish Votes in order to allow the Bill to come on, and that people might understand the tactics of the Ulster Members. If the right hon. Gentleman does not proceed with the Bill he will have got a good many Irish Votes on false pretences.
 COLONEL NOLAN : Well, I suppose we who are not on the Treasury Bench are not in order, but I submit if the Chief Secretary makes a statement we should be allowed reference to it. I have myself refrained from making a good many speeches during the last few days in the hope that the Bill would be brought on. But, of course, if it is not brought on we have no longer any responsibility, and the hon. Member for South Tyrone will have his way. Next year we do not know what new arrangement or combination of Parties may arise.
 COLONEL NOLAN : Well, I speak from experience in small towns, where I know that, simply from the influence of public opinion, children do attend extremely well; but, of course, in large towns the effect of the feeling among the community is lost. On the whole, I do not see that there is any great necessity for compulsion. Certainly

 COLONEL NOLAN : The Commissioners of Education have reported upon the training colleges, and I wish to point out how few there are in Ireland for denominational education, whereas in England out of 41 training colleges something like 38 are conducted on denominational principles. Such is the

(10.54.)  COLONEL NOLAN : Can the right hon. Gentleman say what is the action on the part of the Christian Brothers that prevents them coming under the rules of the Department? I have some knowledge on the subject, but I think some official statement might possibly go a certain distance towards removing the objection.
 COLONEL NOLAN : I believe I am under-estimating. It is a standing grievance that the Christian Brothers, who give the best education to a very large number of children in the South and West of Ireland, do not receive any assistance from the State, except, to a small extent, through the Science and Art Department. I do not say that it is worth while the Christian Brothers insisting on the objection which prevents this assistance being given; but I do think that an arrangement might be arrived at. The Christian Brothers have no objection to receive Protestant children into their schools, and do not insist on their receiving religious education, but they consider it necessary to keep in their schoolrooms certain

 *MR. TALBOT  (Oxford University) : May I ask what business will be proceeded with to-morrow?
 MR. JOSEPH C. BOLTON : The telegram I have received speaks of the postponement of the Government grant until next year as a source of disappointment.
 MR. JOSEPH C. BOLTON  (Stirling) : I wish to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he is aware that the announcement made last evening of his intention to postpone the allocation of Scotland's share in the fee grant is causing considerable dissatisfaction in some parts of Scotland; and if so, whether, considering that hon. Members for Scotland have acquiesced in the postponement of that payment under the idea that it was the general wish of the people of Scotland, he will allow Scotch Members to have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter?
 MR. POWELL J. WILLIAMS : Though the subject I desire to raise may not be so seductive as the condition of Egypt, it has considerable practical importance. I desire to call attention to what I consider a considerable grievance, namely, the extraordinary disadvantages under which an Englishman taking out patents abroad labours as compared with the treatment of foreigners in this country who take out patents here. A German, for instance, taking out a patent in England, can make the articles in Germany and import them here without any injury whatever to his title and his patent; whereas an Englishman taking out a patent in Germany is subject to all kinds of restrictions, which render it almost impossible to carry on the trade under his patent unless the machines used for making the thing patented and the articles themselves are made in Germany. The fact is, I am afraid our Diplomatic Agents abroad have not received much culture in commerce; they are not selected for their commercial experience, and foreign Governments rather get the better of them in these matters. I understand the system to be this: that in relation to the Patent Laws, arrangements, which are called Conventions, between this country and foreign countries, are entered into, and on the face of these Conventions there is little to object to, but the Conventions always contain a clause that there shall be nothing therein contained contrary to the standing Patent Laws of the country which grants the Convention. Under these laws all sorts of conditions are exacted, greatly to the disadvantage of the patentee. When a man wishes to take out a patent in England, whether he is an Englishman or a foreigner, he is only required by our Patent Laws to lodge in the Patent Office sufficient specifications and drawings for showing the patent which he takes out; whereas in foreign countries he is required to provide large working drawings showing every detail in such a manner as enables the foreigner, if he chooses, to set to work and make the article itself. This is in itself a great disadvantage. There are other restrictions—as to time, as to the mode of working the patent, as to making the

 *MR. P. O'BRIEN : Is there any reason why the prison officials in Ireland should not be allowed the same privilege in regard to wearing their own clothes as those in England? What is the special reason for the change?
 MR. P. O'BRIEN  (Monaghan, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether Irish prison officials are obliged to wear the prison uniform when off duty, under pain of dismissal; whether he can give the date of such rule or order by the Prisons Board, and the particular circumstance which called for it; whether, since the issue of this order, prison officers have been assaulted and maimed in the streets of Cork, Kilkenny, Tralee, Belfast, and Kilmainham; whether there is any evidence to show that these attacks were attributable to the fact of the officers being easily recognised by their assailants, in consequence of their uniforms; and whether it has come to the knowledge of the Prisons Board that the officers regard this order making the wearing of prison uniform off duty compulsory as a constant source of personal danger; and, if so, whether he will cause such order to be cancelled?
(2.0.)  MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : There is nothing I admire more than independence. With regard to what the Chancellor of the Exchequer says as to there being a tacit understanding with the hon. Gentlemen who lead the Opposition, I have to say I hold myself perfectly free of the whole lot of them. I shall persist in dividing the House on this matter, at the risk of making myself disagreeable to the Front Opposition Bench and to all those superior persons who are fond of lecturing the House of Commons on manners.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : There is nothing more out of place than the airs of superiority which some Members assume. We have hada pretty lecture from the hon. Member for Gorton, but I deny that we have been wasting the time of the Committee, or that we have asked frivolous questions.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : I, for one, cannot assent to that arrangement, and I shall divide the Committee. Surely it does not matter much if the Session is prolonged a day or two. We do not get the facilities for discussion on the Report stage which we have in Committee. I now move to report Progress.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I am in the same position. I do not think that at twenty minutes to 2 in the morning we ought to be forced to discuss the remaining Estimates.
 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : There may be some justice in what the right hon. Gentleman states, but I hardly think it possible for a poor man like the one of whom I am speaking to obtain justice in the Law Courts against a rich and powerful firm like that of which Sir William Armstrong is the head. I hope, however, the right hon. Gentleman may see fit to re-consider his position, and see that a sum shall be awarded to this gentleman which will give general satisfaction. A small thing of this kind would not add in any appreciable degree to the expenses of the Government.
(3.29.)  MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : I do not believe in bargains with the Government, and if some hon. Members have agreed to defer their observations on the Votes to the Report stage, that is their affair and not mine. I intend to proceed with my remarks. They bear upon a subject which more properly would be dealt with by hon. Members for Newcastle, as it refers to a constituent of theirs, but as they seem to be elsewhere engaged the duty is thrown upon me. The case to which I wish to draw attention is one on which I have asked several questions, though without being able to obtain a satisfactory answer from the Secretary for War. The case is that of a poor working man, named Jobson, who claims to have been the inventor of a certain time fuse, or a certain system of applying it. In 1859 Sir William Armstrong by a combination of the inventions of three men made the Armstrong gun. To render the system perfect a time fuse was required, and that was invented by this man. His models were submitted to the authorities, but were afterwards stolen. Subsequently Sir William Armstrong received a grant for a time fuse, which this man claims to have been his invention. I believe the man would have

 MR. S. HOARE  (Norwich) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether his attention has been called to the serious damage done to the turnip and swede crops in the eastern counties during the last fortnight by the diamond-back moth caterpillar; and whether, as the appearance of this destructive caterpillar is very rare, he will cause immediate inquiries to be made with the view of issuing suggestions to farmers as to the best course to adopt to prevent the total destruction of their turnip and swede crops which in many places threatens them?
 MR. STOREY  (Sunderland) : I am extremely sorry to obtrude a personal matter upon the House again, but I have consulted you, Sir, and with your leave I wish to make a brief explanation. In another place the Marquess of Londonderry made a few days ago an allusion to a statement which I felt it my duty to make in this House. Of course, I do not intend to discuss the remarks of Lord Londonderry. I have no right and no inclination to do so. That statement stands for what it is worth. The noble Lord, however, made one observation in reply to my statement which I am compelled to notice. I had myself stated that the money for the bogus prosecution against me was not taken, or meant to be taken, out of the public funds, as it ought to have been if it were an honest prosecution. I stated, further, that Lord Londonderry must have found the money. To these statements, under cover of a joke and a play upon my name which is not particularly original, and which if it had been uttered here would have been thought a trifle vulgar, that noble Lord gives a distinct contradiction. I therefore, propose, with the permission of the House, to state, with the utmost brevity, the authority upon which I made them. On the 29th of May or thereabouts, there was a meeting of the Joint Committee of the Durham County Council, who have charge of the police. The Clerk of the Peace reported that an

 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : Is it intended that the Amendments to the Factories and Workshops Bill shall be taken as the first Order on Monday?
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : Will the right hon. Gentleman say at what hour the House will meet tomorrow, and if any hour will be named for the Adjournment?
(9.21.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I listened with attention and interest to the speech the Chief Secretary has just delivered. In regard to the matter of training colleges in Ireland, I gather from the speech of the right hon. Gentleman that he proposes to withdraw the Bill which has caused so much feeling within the last 48 hours, and to relieve the House of responsibility until he asks for a Vote next Session. He proposes to take upon himself the responsibility of providing the money, and, having done so, will afterwards come to Parliament for a Vote. So until then the responsibility of Members here will cease. To that course I have no objection, and I am glad the right hon. Gentleman has seen his way to remove a bone of contention; but in parting with the measure I would give it a final kick, though the fundamental objection I have will, of course, arise on the Vote for Training Colleges in the Estimates.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL  (Tyrone, S.) : I object.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I shall not object if the opposition to my Return is withdrawn.
(12.46.)  MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I would point out that the question is not quite so simple as the hon. Member for West Belfast seems to think. It is true the surgeons in Dublin were very active in opposing the Bill to which the hon. Member referred—and I think they made good their case—but I would point out that the opposition to the Bill affecting the Dublin hospitals is not confined to a few interested persons. The fact is, that if the Bill were carried
 1015
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I will reserve what I have to say until the Motion for the withdrawal of the Bill, and I will remain in town for that purpose, merely remarking now that without a Bill the Chief Secretary cannot touch the Irish Church surplus at all. Judging from the speech of the hon. Member for
 980
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I mentioned the average attendance in seven years.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : I do not intend to discuss the Bill.
 MR. T. W. RUSSELL : The hon. Member for West Belfast (Mr. Sexton) and the Chief Secretary have discussed the whole question—
 MR. SEXTON : There is no meaning in the hon. Member's allusions, unless he means it to be inferred that there is something unfair in the proportion awarded to Marlborough Street College. We find that the average attendance at Marlborough Street College is 99 men and 99 women, and in the others, 184 men and 214 women; that is the arithmetical explanation of the figures £10,000 and £21,000. The money for Marlborough Street College is calculated at the same rates as in the case of the other colleges—on the attendance.
(9.30.)  MR. SEXTON : The hon. Member, as is usual with him when he wants to push a case, has not recited all the facts and figures that are relevant. The
 981
(12.40.)  MR. SEXTON : I would like, in a few words, to ask the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury to state precisely the present condition of the public grants to hospitals in Dublin. The House allocates about £17,000 a year to this purpose, but when the Vote was first instituted, the circumstances of the hospitals were very different to what they are at present. Do the Government intend to deal next Session with the question of the apportionment of the grant? Is this grant of £17,000 to be administered for ever according to the circumstances which existed when it was originally given many years ago? The circumstances have largely changed, and the administration of the grants should be changed accordingly. A Bill to effect this was introduced two years ago, but was defeated at the instigation of a few interested medical men in Dublin who object to its provisions. It is very disappointing that the efforts which were made to bring about a better state of things should have been defeated by two or three individuals who thought that the compensation offered to them was not sufficient. I ask for a frank and definite undertaking from the right hon. Gentleman as to whether or not the Government will settle this question next year.
(11.7.)  MR. SEXTON : I should like to ascertain whether the case of Professor Pye has been considered. He is a gentleman who, by the alteration of the University Act, has suffered considerable hardships, and I think the Government should consider the possibility of mitigating his position. The Queen's Colleges cost the country about £40,000 a year, and are regarded as institutions in which mixed education is maintained. I do not think the system can be called a success. The Queen's College, Belfast, is practically a Presbyterian college, and the staff of the college is, I believe, Presbyterian. I should not complain of that, if the colleges of Galway and Cork, both of which are in Roman Catholic districts, were officered by Catholics for Catholic students. I am disposed to think that the only way out of the difficulty will be to give Queen's College, Belfast, to the Presbyterians, possibly as the centre of a Presbyterian University, and in the same way to give the Galway and Cork Colleges to the Roman Catholics. As to Queen's College, Galway, it is situated in the heart of a Catholic province, and the intention of Parliament in founding the college was to afford the means of University education to the Catholic population. In that respect it is a total failure. The total number of students at the college is about 100, of whom not a dozen are Catholics. Of the staff, the President and the Standing Committee are all Protestants, and out of 15 professors only throe are Catholics. This college is maintained at a cost of £12,000 a year, and it is time for Parliament to consider whether it is any longer justified in spending this large sum to no purpose. The Cork and Galway Colleges have been rejected by the population of the districts in which they are situated, and consequently
 999
 MR. SEXTON : I desire to ask the Minister for Agriculture a question in reference to the Tuberculosis Commission, which has been appointed for an unlimited period. At the time the Commission was appointed I pointed out that, although Ireland was supposed to be interested in the question of tuberculosis, there was no gentleman connected with Ireland on the Commission. The Minister for Agriculture at that time suggested to me that I should make inquiries as to what gentleman should be put on the Commission in the interest of Ireland. I referred the matter to competent persons in Dublin, and submitted the name of a gentleman who had distinguished himself in investigations on this subject.
 MR. SEXTON : The Commissioners have only been acting for one year, it having been appointed in July, 1890, and I say there is abundance of time for the appointment of other Commissioners. The right hon. Gentleman can issue a Supplementary Warrant if he chooses, and I hope that that is what he intends to do.
 MR. SEXTON : My point is that it is not fair to treat a man who has climbed to the top rung of the ladder of classification exactly as if he remained at the bottom.
(7.49.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I desire to point out that, while there is an increase in the Education Votes in the case of England and Scotland, in the case of Ireland there is a decrease, from £933,000 last year to £927,000 this year. In spite of all our protests, some Irish Votes, for purposes which we consider useless, grow year after year, yet we find that a heavy reduction occurs in this Educational Vote. Moreover, we find that whilst the cost of administration and inspection, and the salaries of the higher officials, are maintained at an undiminished amount, the reduction—and it is a heavy one—takes place in the item for the salaries of the teachers. That is precisely the item which we should be glad to see increased. The result fees have fallen short this year by £18,000, and that, I have no doubt, means a considerable increase of hardship to a very hard-working and poorly-paid body of men. I think the time has

 MR. SEXTON : Has it not occurred to the right hon. Gentleman as an old Parliamentary hand that advantage might be taken to discuss Report of Supply at great length, simply to prevent the Training Colleges Bill being reached?
 MR. SEXTON : I wish to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he considers
 944
 MR. SEXTON : What do the Government propose to do in reference to the Training Colleges (Ireland) Bill?
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : This is the case of a gentleman who occupies a public position presiding at an Orange demonstration, and why does it not come within the rule laid down by the Education Department?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I will repeat the question on Monday.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if the attention of the Inspector General of the Royal Irish Constabulary has been called to the language used by District Inspector Rogers, Royal Irish Constabulary, Carrick-on-Shannon, to his men in the Petty Sessions Court, as reported in the  Roscommon Herald
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether the Commissioners of National education have yet considered the application for a retiring gratuity made by the late teacher of Derrycra National School, County Down, in November last, accompanied with the necessary medical certificate of permanent incapacity; and will it be further delayed in view of the rule of the Commissioners that, in the event of death before receiving the gratuity, payment will not be made to the teacher's family?
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : What is the hon. and learned Gentleman's information with regard to the other learned gentlemen named in the question?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Perhaps I may be allowed to submit that there is a precedent with regard to the method of dealing with the Lords' Amendment. It arose upon the Coroners (Ireland) Bill. The Clerk was then Sir Erskine May, and Mr. Brand, the Speaker, ruled that it was for this House to reject a Lords' Amendment absolutely, and to leave it to the Lords to make any subsequent Amendment; it was not for this House
 941
 MR. T. M. HEALY : Is this gentleman a paid Resident Magistrate?
(1.4.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : The point urged by my hon. Friend is that we as an agricultural community are deeply interested in obtaining fitting representation on the Commission, and it is no answer to say that it rests with the Commissioners
 1018
(1.14.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I wish to ask a question with regard to the Educational Schools Commission in Ireland. That Commission is doing its work very slowly; and although the expense of the Commission is not very large, being about £4,000, it is nevertheless a matter which is deserving of consideration. That Commission has been re-appointed year after year by an Act included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and it was not intended that that body should sit in perpetuity. Having regard to the work the Commission has to do, it seems to me that it is very desirable it should be wound up as speedily as possible, and that the Government ought to put some pressure on those gentlemen in order to bring their work to a conclusion. They ought to take notice of the number of
 1020
(11.32.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I hope that with regard to the appointment of the staff of the colleges the Government will not allow the vices that now exist to be perpetuated. It is new to me that these appointments are made by a kind of co-optation: the longer we live the more we learn. My hon. Friend has pointed out that Protestant ascendancy in its most virulent form prevails in the colleges at Galway and Cork. Of course, as to the appointment of Professor Sullivan, it was a wonderful instance of the benevolence of the British Government to throw a few crumbs to a Catholic. We believe that any Government which succeeds the Government of the right hon. Gentleman must do something in this matter. It would not cost the State more to appoint a Catholic than a Protestant, but it would harmonise with the general feelings and prejudices, if I may use the word, of the population. Accordingly, I say the Lord Lieutenant ought in his appointments to have regard to the general colouring of the district in which these colleges exist. We do not object if in Belfast you appoint a gentleman of the religion which prevails in that city. You have, as regards Galway and Cork, such a state of things that we may fairly call upon you to bring the colleges into harmony with the religious opinions of the populations. If the Lord Lieutenant does his duty he may do something to render the appointments less obnoxious to the populations in the midst of which the colleges are. Such appointments will certainly be made when the Irish people have the management of their own affairs.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg to inform the hon. Member that we shall say in this House just what we like, whether it pleases him or his friends or not.
(10.38.)  MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I will not go into the comparison presented by the amount devoted to national education and to other purposes in these Votes. Much has been said on the teachers' salaries, and much may be said on behalf of the children who are taught. The question of books was raised many years ago by the hon. Member for the Scotland Division (Mr. T. P. O'Connor), when, I think, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bridgeton (Sir G. Trevelyan) was Chief Secretary; and now, when the present Chief Secretary contemplates a new departure in Irish education, it is fitting that we should say a few words on this topic, though the time and circumstances of the Session do not admit of full discussion. I desire to offer a general protest against the system of education in Ireland. If we are going to have compulsory attendance, then I say we must provide the children with some better instruction in the schools into which they are forced. The books contain the greatest nonsense imaginable. What is the advantage a child will get from reading Dr. Whateley's nonsense on political economy. Why are the children tortured with spelling and grammar and geography in the form presented in these books? What the children ought to be taught first is to read, but under the system of spelling it takes five years to teach a child to read, whereas in other countries a child can be taught to read in 12 months. If you take up the grammar in the Irish National schools, you will find that nothing more difficult could be put into the hands of children. What interest can be excited in the mind of a child by a "demonstrative adjective pronoun;" what is the use of burdening his memory with the height
 995
 MR. T. M. HEALY : With regard to the valuation which is to be made of the buildings, will the right hon. Gentleman say whether the work is to be entrusted to the Board of Works, or are the Government going to proceed under the Public Works Loan Act, 1889?
(11.4.)  MR. T. M. HEALY : I desire to ask what are the intentions of the Government with regard to the vacancies that must be created in the teaching staffs of these colleges under the Civil Service rules? As I hold that the Queen's Colleges will never meet with anything like approval, I do not feel entitled to make the same strong representation as if I were a supporter of them; at the same time, from the point of view of public policy, it is extremely desirable—
 998
 MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : Be-fore the right hon. Gentleman answers the question, I should like to ask him whether hon. Members who represent Scotland in this House have not cordially agreed in the proposal that the matter should be postponed until next Session?
(6.10.)  MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : I hope the Government will give us some information, if possible in the form of a Return, as to the number of schools in which fees are charged in any, or all, standards, the number of scholars in each parish or School Board district who pay these fees, and the number of schools. What I

 MR. JACKSON : A Memorial addressed to the Commissioners of Woods by the lessees of seven Crown slate quarries in Carnarvonshire was received at the Office of Woods yesterday. According to ordinary practice, this Memorial will be referred to Mr. Forster Brown to examine and report on. There will be no objection to giving the Memorialists an opportunity of representing their views to Mr. Forster Brown.
 MR. JACKSON : It is difficult to give an answer to such a general question. I should say that, as a rule, they are not paid for overtime.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : I am informed that the parties to the contract are the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor and Mr. Elliott, the contractor. I have no knowledge of the details of the arrangements in the Courts, and I should be inclined to doubt whether there are numerous members of the legal profession who have acquired habits of intemperance through any difficulty in obtaining tea or coffee in the Courts; but I will communicate with the Lord Chancellor's Department, if the hon. Member wishes it, or perhaps the hon. Member will do so himself.
 MR. JACKSON : Perhaps the hon. Member will furnish me with the names of the members of the Bar to whom he refers.
(12.50.)  THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : I will make inquiry into the matter, if the hon. and gallant Gentleman will be good enough to speak to me privately and explain exactly what his point, is.
 MR. JACKSON : I entirely agree with what the hon. Member has said, and I have already drawn attention to the matter in the earlier part of the year, when I was assured that the work was being wound up. I believe that this will be the last year for which the money will have to be provided.
 MR. JACKSON : I should have risen to answer the hon. Member before had not the hon. and gallant Gentleman, who knows much more about the subject than I do, come to my relief. I would point out that this matter has been considered on several previous occasions, and I do not know any question on which it would be more difficult to make an alteration that would give general satisfaction. Several attempts have been made to alter the appropriation of the money which is given in this way, and I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Peterborough that these Queen's Plates have done nothing to improve the breed of horses. I think it is certainly undesirable to take any step that would tend to discourage the production of a good breed of horses either in Ireland or in England.
(12.57.)  MR. JACKSON : I cannot call to mind the particular promise to which the hon. Member refers. I would point out, however, that I have no power to dictate or initiate any proceedings with regard to particular manuscripts. The matter rests entirely with the Commission, and not with the Treasury. All I can do is to convey to the Secretary to the Commission any questions the hon. Gentleman may
 1017
 MR. JACKSON : I am speaking only of the fees which are payable to the Exchequer. If the hon. Member will wait for the Return he will get an authoritative statement.
 MR. JACKSON : I believe the fees paid to the Exchequer by Archbishops and Bishops on their appointment will appear from a Return which will be presented before the end of the Session. I think that Return will show that the fees paid by a Bishop are something like £40, and not £400, and we do not get complaints of the excess from those gentlemen who have to pay them on account of receiving certain honours and dignities.
 *MR. MATHER : I made no allusion to the hon. Member. I only said some speeches had been made which could well have been cut down considerably.
 *MR. MATHER  (Lancashire, S.E., Gorton) : I think it is only fair that we on this side of the House should cooperate with the view of shortening the Debate on the Estimates. Inquiries have been made by hon. Members in their places which could have been satisfied by the application of ordinary intelligence, and I think speeches have been made at undue length. Some consideration should be shown for the House, and speeches might very well be limited to 10 or 15 minutes.
 SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : The right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that I should ask him to-day what fixtures the Government have been able to make with regard to Public Business in the future. I have also to ask the right hon. Gentleman a question of great importance as regards the privileges of this House. I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman what course he proposes to take with reference to the constitutional objection that was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton (Mr. H. Fowler) last night in reference to one of the Lords Amendments to the Education Bill. That was an objection which affected not only the Lords Amendment to the Bill, but the rights of this House. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will feel that the House is entitled to know at once the course which the Government propose to take upon a question of such grave importance, which not only affects the Bill itself, but the rights of this House. He will feel that the question is one which should be maturely considered at a time when it can be properly discussed by the House.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : In reference to the Lords' Amendment to the Free Education Bill, I do not quite under stand the course the right hon. Gentle
 940
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I venture to think that the last named course most comports with the dignity and privileges of this House. A clause which is an invasion of the privileges of this House has been sent down by the Lords; what we have to do is to reject it; it is for the Lords to amend it, or to substitute another proposal which shall not be open to that objection. Therefore I hope we may take it for granted that that will be the course suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and that we need waste no further time over it, but that will be the end of the question so far as we are concerned.
*(7.45.)  MR. MORTON : Before the Vote is taken I desire to put a question to the Lord Advocate which I promised the hon. Member for Haggerston to put. I desire to ask what are the hours of work in the Scotch Education Office in London?
*(7.40.)  MR. MORTON : I am not quite satisfied with the answer I have got—especially having regard to the way in which the Lord Advocate finished up. I will not now deal with the question of the Universities however, as they will come under another Vote. I am surprised at the right hon. Gentleman's statement in regard to the Education Office, and it does not appear to me to convey a very good reason for the Vote. I do not wish to put the Committee to the trouble of a Division, but I must say I very much regret that on the sectarian question the Scotch Members have not had the courage to follow the example set them by the English and Irish Members last night. I hope they will yet have the courage to move the reduction of the Vote—and if they do I shall be happy to vote with them. I hope the day is not far distant when Scotland will have Home Rule, and when all these local affairs will be managed in Scotland, for the benefit of Scotsmen. I am sure that they will be much better managed than they are at present by South Kensington Scotsmen.
 MR. MORTON : Does the Department appoint teachers?
*(7.30.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : Whatever cause of complaint the hon. Member may have, I think the Scottish Members have been treated better than Members representing English constituencies were treated last night, when the English Education Vote was not commenced until after 12 o'clock. I am glad to think the Scottish people have been treated a little better, although not, perhaps, so well as they deserve. I am sorry that it should be necessary to go into these matters here. I am of opinion that it would be much better if all these local matters were dealt with in Scotland, and if the Imperial Parliament were not troubled with going into them at all. However, as we have to deal with them it is our duty to make a few inquiries. I would ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman whether he does not think that the office in London could be removed to Edinburgh in the interest of education in Scotland. I see that in the office in Edinburgh—under sub-head "K"—there are officials whose salaries amount to £640. I would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he does not think that this office could be transferred to London, and that office in London under sub-head "A" transferred to Edinburgh. That would be something in the way of Scottish Home Rule, and as I am in favour of Home Rule for Scotland as well as for Ireland, I should not object to it. Then, I would ask the Lord Advocate if properly qualified teachers have an opportunity in Scotland of obtaining the posts of Inspectors, Sub-Inspectors, and so on? I have seen somewhere a statement to the effect that they have that opportunity, but I wish to obtain precise information on the point—information which, pos-

 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the Attorney General whether he is aware that it has been found necessary to procure a licence from the Magistrates to sell intoxicating liquors in the refreshment rooms at the Royal Courts of Justice; and whether the consent of the Magistrates ought, in like manner, to be procured for the sale of intoxicating liquors at the refreshment bars within the precincts of the House of Commons?
 *MR. MORTON : I must say there is something indecent in trying to force
 1025
 *MR. MORTON : I am anxious that we should make progress, but the noise which has been made throughout the most interesting speech of the hon. Member for the St. Rollox Division has prevented us from hearing his complaint. This is not the way to conduct the business of the House. The conduct of hon. Gentlemen opposite is so disgraceful that I am bound to support the Motion for Progress in the interest of law and order
*(3.17.)  MR. MORTON : I notice here an item of £4,000 in connection with packets to Newfoundland. I am informed by some people in Newfoundland that the Allan Line who received this £4,000

 *MR. MORTON : But the First Lord of the Treasury told us that the fees paid into the Exchequer by an Archbishop were £330, and by a Bishop £220.
*(1.40.)  MR. MORTON : The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made an appeal to me, but I give him fair notice that on the Army Vote I intend to raise a question as to gambling. In looking after the economical administration of public money I am only acting on the advice he gave me in 1889. Does he intend to force all the Votes through tonight?
 *MR. MORTON : Is it not possible, pending the receipt of the Report, to relax the prosecutions? The Government could advise those who have to deal with these cases to be as gentle as possible in their methods.
*(1.25.)  MR. MORTON : Very well, I will leave this matter for the consideration of the Home Rule Parliament, which will probably be established about this time 12 months. I should like now to

 *MR. MORTON : There is a strong feeling in this country that this sort of thing should be done away with. I do not desire to put the Committee to the trouble of dividing if I can only obtain a satisfactory answer from the Secretary to the Treasury.
*(1.19.)  MR. MORTON : I should like to know what is the meaning of the Subhead D. As far as I can understand it, it relates to money for the provision of Queen's Plates to be run for in Ireland. Turning to Sub-head M, I find that, as far as England is concerned, an alteration has been made in the allocation of the money which used to be given for this purpose, and that it is now given not for the encouragement of horse racing or that sort of villainy, as I am almost tempted to call it, but for the improvement of the breed of horses in Great Britain. I should like to know whether the time has not arrived when we can make a similar change with regard to the gift of this money to Ireland, so that, instead of encouraging horse racing there, which, as everyone knows, is one of the worst evils we can foster, it may be given for improving the breed of horses. I am told that this subsidy is no use in Ireland except to

*(12.52.)  MR. MORTON : I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board a question as to the Royal Commission on Vaccination. I suppose that on this Vote the only question I should be entitled to ask on this subject is when we are likely to get the Report. When I brought forward the matter a few weeks back the right hon. Gentleman replied that the subject was before
 1016
*(12.25.)  MR. MORTON : I quite understand that the right hon. Gentleman has given me the best answer he can. He tells me the reason why we pay less to our Representative at Washington than in some other countries is that the Government of that country have not agreed to call him an Ambassador. I, therefore, gather that the amount of salary does not depend upon the work to be done, or the ability of the Representative, but upon whether the Government of the country have agreed to call him by a particular name. The absurdity of the

*(12.15.)  MR. MORTON : It appears to me that the appointment of Sir Henry Drummond Wolff is what is known as a political job. I cannot understand why an Envoy, or an Ambassador, or whatever you like to call our Representative in Roumania, should have £4,000 or £5,000 a year, when our Representative in

 MR. MORTON : I should like the right hon. Gentleman to be good enough to explain how it is that the office in Dublin costs so much more than the Scotch Office.
 THE SOLICITOR GENERAL FOR SCOTLAND (Sir C. PEARSON,  Edinburgh and St. Andrews Universities) : In the absence of my right hon. Friend I will reply to the question. The total deductions from the grants to day schools under the Scotch Code (all but a very small portion of which were made under one section or other of Article 32, for insufficiency of local income, defects in premises or instruction, or insufficient staff) amounted in 1888 to £5,735 7s. 10d.; 1889 to £5,840 19s. 1d.; 1890 to £4,859 4s. 5d. The deductions so made are from the grants paid to school managers, and the Department has no means of saying how far under any special arrangement any loss may fall upon the teachers. Any part of the Parliamentary grant not expended at the close of the financial year is annually surrendered to the Exchequer. No such claim as that referred to by the hon. Member is before the Department, nor is any such draft scheme as he indicates
 923
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I think we ought to congratulate ourselves that this charge has been diminished. But we cannot get rid of the charge altogether until we get rid of the island, which we ought to try to do. The taking possession of it was a very improvident bargain.
(11.40.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : At this time of the night I do not propose to detain the Committee at any great length. I have put down a Motion to reduce the salary of the Agent General in Egypt, but I at once say I have not the least desire to reduce the salary of Sir Evelyn Baring; my Motion is purely formal. On a former occasion I asked certain questions in connection with the Foreign Office Vote—in connection with the Triple Alliance and the  status quo 1003 "We have managed to possess ourselves of every part of Africa which is of the slightest importance, and in Egypt we have the finest cotton-growing country in the world."
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : If hon. Members from Ireland desire to promote Home Rule in their country they will do well to say as little as possible about their intention to govern the country in accordance with Roman Catholic views.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I rise to order. I did not move a reduction of the Vote, but I thought I should get an answer.
(12.0.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : I must protest against the subject of our rule in Egypt being mixed up with the Patent Laws, and, therefore, I beg to move to reduce the Vote by £500, part of the salary of the Agent and Consul General in Egypt.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I am sure the hon. Member knows that the last thing I should desire would be to treat him with discourtesy or give an inadequate answer on any matter he brings before the House. The hon. Member must know, after many years' experience of these Debates, that, as a rule, when no Amendment is moved, it is usual for the representative of the Department to wait to hear what other members of the Committee may say, and then to make a somewhat multifarious speech, without unduly prolonging debate. I will endeavour, without doing any injustice to the hon. Member, to deal with the two subjects that have been brought forward. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy has for a, long time devoted a great deal of attention to Egypt, and it is not unreasonable that he should, for the first time this year, call particular attention to the Reports submitted to the House upon the progress in the administration in Egypt. Though we interfere as little as possible in that administration, undoubtedly British influence has been much concerned in the reforms accomplished in that country during the last few years. I do not think I need discuss the question of whether the occupation of Egypt by our troops is to be short or not. I am sure that the

 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : I will answer all at once.
*(12.20.)  SIR J. FERGUSSON : I think I have already pointed out, that although there is an increase in the salary of the Minister to Roumania, there will not be any increased charge to the public, because the Diplomatic Vote this year shows a reduction of £1,422. The hon. Gentleman has asked for information which is familiar to gentlemen who have been
 1011
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : It is intended to raise the class of the mission to Roumania, which has largely gained in importance. It is very necessary that Great Britain should be represented in Roumania by a man of ability and considerable diplomatic standing. The Minister is Sir H. Drummond Wolff, and it is intended to raise his salary by £1,000. Considering his eminent services and ability, I think this is only commensurate with the rank and importance of the mission. Of course, this does not appear in the present Estimate; it will be necessary to submit a Supplementary Estimate.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : In reply to my hon. Friend (Mr. Isaacson) I have to say that the reason why the Domain Loan has not been converted as profitably as the Privilege Loan is that it has not been found practicable to do so. The Conversion operation last year had the effect of reducing the capital of the debt from £8,587,000 to £7,300,000, which was a great advantage. No doubt the Egyptian Government will be glad to convert this debt to a smaller rate, if possible. I am sorry I cannot satisfy the hon. Member for Peterborough; but, perhaps, I need not try. Everyone, except himself, is aware that the expenses of an Ambassador are necessarily, much heavier than those of a Minister.

 *THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : I have been requested by my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary for India to reply to this question. The answer to the first question of the hon. Gentleman is that there is no such rule
 913
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : My right hon. Friend has requested me to answer the question. It would be a criminal offence, under the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, punishable with fine and imprisonment, for any person to sell, or expose for sale, sewing cotton bearing a false description of the number of yards for sale, unless he can prove his action to be innocent, and gives information as to the person from whom he obtained the goods. The Government of India has taken every step to make the law known to all dealers, and there seems to be no necessity for further measures of publicity. The Government of India is always ready to give all the help it can in enforcing the provisions of the Act.
 SIR J. FERGUSSON : The hon. Member must remember that I do not represent the India Office, and that I can give no information as to matters of detail. There is no doubt that as regards a great number of the un-covenanted appointments in India they are restricted, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, but that is not the case in regard to the appointment of the Presidency Magistrates. I am not able to say in what vernacular language Mr. Webb can conduct the business which

WEBSTER,  Isle of Wight) : Licences are required at the Royal Courts of Justice because, being in several districts and refreshments being sold to the public, licences are necessary. I am informed that licences have never been considered necessary in the House of Commons on the ground that the buildings form part of a Royal palace.
 MR. S. T. EVANS  (Glamorgan, Mid) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Government propose to proceed further with the Clergy Discipline (Immorality) Bill, or any part of it, this Session?
 MR. LEA : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if any information has reached Her Majesty's Government in reference to the shipwrecked British sailors alleged to be detained in South America, and to investigate the truth of the report, or effect their release, a gunboat has been sent?
 MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if information has been sent to the Government that a number of English sailors are detained against their will on board the Chilian vessel  Presidente Errazuriz
 MR. LEA : Is there any intention of taking the Coinage Bill to-morrow?
 MR. LEA : Are we to understand that the Training Colleges Bill will not be taken to-night?
 MR. LEA : In view of the desire to bring the Session to a close, I and my hon. Colleague (Mr. T. W. Russell) have no intention of continuing the discussion in respect to the training colleges. We will reserve anything we have got to say until next Session. May I ask, however, if we are to understand that when the Bill is reached to-night the Order will be discharged?
*(10.26.)  MR. LEA  (Londonderry, S.) : The hon. Gentleman has suggested that the Christian Brothers in Ireland should be relieved from some of the rules of the Education Board in Ireland; but that seems to me an absurd proposal. It is not for the State to lay down rules for a particular body. The State grants money and lays down general conditions on which that money can be received, and it is for the religious bodies who wish to obtain a share of it to conform to the conditions. I do not undervalue the work the Christian Brothers do; but, at the same time, it is quite impossible for the State to make an exception in their behalf. The hon. and gallant Gentleman (Colonel Nolan) has to-night had an opportunity of letting off that steam which for two or three days has been accumulating, so much to his discomfort, but I doubt whether the Chief Secretary will thank him for having told us that he and his friends have held their tongues for three days in consequence of what has been given in the endowment of the training colleges. On that subject I would ask the Chief Secretary whether I have correctly understood him. I understand that he proposes not to obtain the money by means of a Bill, but to enlarge the Vote for Education next year. Well, he will do that on his own responsibility; and it will be open to those who have opposed him on this subject to move a reduction in the proposed Vote next Session. That policy is entirely on the right hon. Gentleman's responsibility, and I and my friends are relieved by the course he intends to pursue. I should be glad if the Chief Secretary can see his way to give £180,000 or £200,000 to the teachers, which they are entitled to under the arrangements of this year.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : It is not the intention of the Department to prolong the existence of the Yardley School Board beyond September. 1892.

 SIR W. HART DYKE : Of course, there must be limits to the active part taken in political meetings, but in this case I do not think that those limits have been exceeded.
 SIR W. HART DYKE : The right hon. Gentleman was not, I think, present when I answered the question the other day—[Mr. MUNDELLA: Oh, yes, I heard it]—when I stated that an Instruction had been issued by the Lord President insisting that Inspectors should not take an active part in political meetings. Of course, there is a distinction between attending and taking an active part, such as speaking from the platform.
 SIR W. PLOWDEN  (Wolverhampton, W.) : I hope the right hon. Gentleman will give us to-morrow some information in regard to the difficulty experienced in the forging of steel for guns.
(12.5.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE  (Carnarvon,  : I object to these Amendments, on account of their interference with the industries upon the short lines of North Wales. Most of these lines are short branch railways for the conveyance of local traffic. The London and North Western Railway Company have bought them up for something like 30 per cent. of the amount of their stock, and they are altogether the cheapest railways on the London and North Western system. Some of them are exceptionally cheap. The land was obtained at a very low rate, and the stations erected are of a very shoddy description. Nevertheless, it is proposed by this Bill to impose the same terminal charges upon them as are imposed in the case of the great English lines, without giving to the traders in the district the advantages of the maximum rates which are given in England.
(1.51.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS  (Carnarvonshire, Eifion) : I have two small points to bring forward. In the first place, I have to urge the importance of appointing in Welsh-speaking districts post office officials who speak the Welsh language, and, in the next place, I have to complain that in North Wales there is no post office in which female telegraphists are employed. There is no opportunity given to women in Wales to learn telegraphy, and I think a better chance should be given to women to enter the Telegraph Service.
(3.23.)  MR. LLOYD-GEORGE  (Carnarvon,  : I desire to call attention to the employment of military in North Wales to assist the police in the collection of tithes. The particular instance I have to bring forward relates to the employment of a troop of Hussars. I do not think the military should be at anytime called in unless there is every probability that it will be utterly impossible for the police to preserve order. In the case to which I allude there was not the slightest danger of any serious riot occurring. Before the Hussars were sent down there had been three previous tithe sales. An investigation has been made by the Police Committee into the circumstances under which the Hussars were called in. At the inquiry the police were represented by counsel, and so were the tithepayers. The first witness called by the police was Constable Evans, and he said that on the first occasion the crowd at its largest numbered from 130 to 150. Our estimate is that the crowd did not exceed 80. On the face of it, it appears to be against the public interest to call a troop of Hussars into a district to keep in order a crowd which even numbers 150. The constable was asked to describe the worst part of what was said to be a riot, and he said then; was considerable noise, but no assault; no one was hurt, but it was rather difficult for the officers to carry out their duty of collecting the tithe. A police officer in plain clothes said he was there to be called upon if necessary, but he was not called on, simply
 1069 1070
(3.47.)  MR. J. BRYN ROBERTS : We do not say that there should be a discretion with the Military Authorities. We say the Government should exercise a discretion on a matter of general policy. Surely the right hon. Gentleman will not lay down the proposition that whenever the Civil Authorities send for military assistance without question, that assistance should be given. I am unable to acquit the Government of an intention to get up a case for the Tithe Bill of last year. I have no sort of doubt that the military would not have been called upon but for the fact that for three Sessions there had been attempts to pass the Tithe Bill, and it was necessary to get up some pressure of public opinion to force the Bill through. So this method was adopted for creating the impression that the proceedings at this sale reached the magnitude of a riot, necessitating the removal of a troop of Hussars from one end of the Kingdom to another to this rural district in Denbighshire. There was not the slightest necessity, there was no personal violence, and the sending of a troop of Hussars from Manchester was merely to create a sensation. It is natural that the Welsh nation and the Welsh Members should feel aggrieved by the fact that the Chief Constable allowed himself to be made a tool of by ecclesiastical dignitaries and Magistrates to force a political move. The military were brought into the diocese of St. Asaph, the Bishop of which has been most prominent in the endeavour to force the Tithe Bill through. My hon. Friend is justified in raising this protest to mark our sense of the proceeding.
(3.56.)  COLONEL NOLAN : I observe some newspaper reports to the effect that there have been some complaints in reference to the quality of bread supplied. I do not say there is any truth in the reports, but can the right hon. Gentleman give us any information upon this matter?
(4.23.)  COLONEL NOLAN : The right hon. Gentleman who has just sat down is always opening up this question, and as it is one he has studied most profoundly. I hope the Secretary for War will pay the greatest attention to experiments on all these details concerning clips, the length of the loading rod, the place for the mainspring, and so on. These experiments could be made for £2 or £3—almost for a few shillings—and the mere fact that these defects have been pointed out by the right hon. Gentleman, who is so well known in the rifle world, and who takes such a deep interest in all these subjects, renders it necessary that further experiments should be carried out. If experiments are carried out, in another year the Secretary for War will be able to tell us how the faults of the rifle are to be rectified, or whether the War Office intend to retain the rifle in its present form. But, after all, these points are not of great importance. The non-delivery of the cartridge from the magazine, of which the right hon. Gentleman complains, is undoubtedly a serious defect, but I think that may be due to an imperfection in the mechanism of the particular rifle that the right hon. Gentleman fired, because I have not
 1079 1080
(5.15.)  COLONEL NOLAN : Although I spoke on this subject last night, I did so rather with the idea of inducing the Financial Secretary to the War Office to make himself acquainted with the facts before the Report stage. My complaint is that the charge made for the education of cadets is extortionate. The fees amount to £150, and are a great deal too high. A cadet's maintenance cannot cost more than £60 or £70 a year. A certain number of military cadets, the sons of officers, are educated at a less charge than that made for the sons of civilians, and although it is a very proper thing that a certain number of cadets should be admitted at a low rate, I do not think the country should be generous at the expense of civilian fathers.
(5.55.)  COLONEL NOLAN : The subdivision of the two branches of the Artillery is a very important matter. It is very necessary it should take place at some time or other, and probably this is the time it should take place, as the scientific position of the Artillery has been much changed. The Garrison Artillery has been looked upon as the refuge of the destitute, and everything ought to be done to make it attractive. If you want the officer in the Garrison Artillery to be a good officer you must make his position as good as that of the officer in
 1093
(2.0.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I wish to raise a point which I have already put in questions as to the Cork and Mulkerry Light Railway Company and the Parcels Post. The right hon. Gentleman told me that he was not aware that the company had made any proper application. I wish to call his attention to the correspondence which I have, which shows that the company has been dealt with in a rather peculiar way. The letters to the Cork Company have been referred from the Post Office to the Railway Clearing House, and from the Railway Clearing House to the Post Office. I think now that some reasonable and definite reply should be given, and that a convenience should be granted which is desired by the people of Cork. Another point is the establishment of a permanent post office at Kilbarry. For the last 25 years the local schoolmaster has turned his house into a, post office, and performed postal services gratuitously, the average of parcels left at his house being about 100 per week. Repeated representations on the subject have been without success, and the local schoolmaster has thrown up this gratuitous post. I trust the right hon. Gentleman will consider the establishment of a permanent post office at Kilbarry. Another point to which I wish to draw attention has relation to the mail car route from Timoleague to Port MacSherry. There is a railway on one side of that route, and deep water on the other, and traffic, pedestrian or vehicular, is attended with considerable peril. It is desired that the Department should put up a fence as a protection, and in that request the local landlords have joined. The interests of everybody are concerned in this matter, and I sincerely hope the right hon Gentleman will give some attention to the subject.
 MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Member would not be in order in raising that question now.
 MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! That has no reference to this Vote.
 MR. SPEAKER : The hon. Gentleman has not referred to the Vote yet.
 MR. SPEAKER : For the second time I have to remind the hon. Member that his remarks are not relevant to the Vote.
 MR. SPEAKER : This has little to do with the subject - matter of the Resolution.
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : That was not my suggestion; that is what the Chief Constable said in evidence.
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : It must not be forgotten that the English lines, whether main or branch lines, have cost, an enormous sum of money to make, and therefore. I do not see why exceptional treatment should be provided in reference to maximum rates in that case without giving the same treatment to the Welsh traders, especially as the same rate of terminal charges is to be imposed. I could instance the case of one station which cost only £800 to construct; and if these terminal charges are fully enforced, the company would receive every year more than three times the entire cost of construction. The Chester and Holyhead Railway is practically a main line, and yet it is treated on exactly the same footing as a small branch railway of three or four miles. I ask the President of the Board of Trade to meet the traders, so as to place the branch lines to Carnarvon in the same condition in which they would have been had the Bill not been amended in the Lords. At the present moment the slate quarries get their coals from the Port of Carnarvon, whereas other traders are able to obtain coal much cheaper by the larger lines; and if the Bill is to remain in its present condition, the result will be that the London and North Western Railway will impose such a charge upon the coal brought to the Port of Carnal von and conveyed to the quarries that it will be much cheaper to have it in future supplied direct from the great collieries to the slate districts. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider the question. I cannot imagine that it is the policy of the London and North Western Railway Company to crush the traffic upon the small railways by enforcing such exceptionally high rates.
 MR. LLOYD-GEORGE : I beg to move the omission of the words "Carnarvon to Llanberis," in line 2. The old scale of charges was 2d. per mile, but such a scale is utterly inapplicable to the present circumstances of the locality. The line from Carnarvon to Llanberis is a very cheap line. There are no bridges and no tunnels upon it, and the land was obtained very cheaply. There is no reason, therefore, why it should be exceptionally treated as is now proposed. I think it is a line that ought to be placed in the same condition in regard to maximum rates as the great lines in the Kingdom, seeing that, although the stations upon it are extremely insignificant, the company will have the power of making full terminal charges.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : I appeal to the hon. Member not, at such a period and with such a House, to proceed to a Division. I associate with that an appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say what he proposes when the Government Business is disposed of.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : Perhaps I may be allowed to say that the arrangements which the right hon. Gentleman is understood to have made have, as far as I know, been received with great satisfaction. As I raised the question, I beg to thank him, in the name of the Crimean men, for what he has done.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I object to the Motion being withdrawn. I have not objected to the last three private Members' Bills being taken, because all three of them were unopposed; but now we have got to a highly contentious Bill. I do not know whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer has read this Bill, but it bristles with disputed points; and if the consideration of that measure is to be entered into now, I do not know how much longer we may be detained in discussing it. I am extremely sorry to oppose the measure, but I would remind the House that there were a number of gentlemen kept here until very untimely hours this morning for the purpose of either supporting or opposing this Bill. We have now arrived at the close of the day, which was especially given to the transaction of the Government Business. None of us knew that Private Business was to be
 1106
 *MR. MARJORIBANKS : At any rate, this rifle, which was very much praised, had to be thrown aside. Then the Committee tried a large number of rifles, and eventually selected three, which they placed in the following order:—first, the Owen Jones; secondly, the Lee-Burton; and, thirdly, the Lee. Mr. Owen Jones was asked to have manufactured 5,000 rifles of his patent. For one reason or another that fell through, and in the spring of 1886 an order was given for the manufacture of 2,500 Owen Jones rifles at Enfield, involving a large expenditure for new plant and machinery, and I have myself seen rifles manufactured at Enfield of that particular pattern in the spring of 1886. At the same time an order was given for the manufacture of 300 of the Lee-Burton pattern. In the following September, however, they reversed the order, and they placed the Lee, which had stood third on the list, first. Using that rifle as a foundation they evolved the present magazine rifle. This chopping and changing about on the part of the Committee certainly does not give rise to increased confidence in the wisdom of their selection, and that confidence, as far as it exists, is further shaken by the fact that two members of the Committee, when giving evidence this Session before a Committee of this House, differed altogether as to the range of the new rifle. One member (Colonel Slade) said that the extreme range of the Martini-Henry was from 3,400 to 3,500 yards; and of the magazine rifle, 3,700 to 3,800; while the other (Sir Henry Halford) said he believed the extreme range of the new
 1078
*(3.57.)  MR. MARJORIBANKS  (Berwickshire) : I do not think the right hon. Gentleman will be surprised if I take this opportunity of saying a few words in reference to the adoption of the new rifle. This Vote contains no less than £1,250,000 for small arms and ammunition. The question of ammunition is, of course, inseparable from that of small arms; they cannot be treated separately. Now, it is undeniable that the new rifle was adopted before the War Office had got the ammunition to suit
 1074 1075
 *MR. MARJORIBANKS : It was decided to try a new pattern, which pattern was again altered, and in March we had a new "Mark II.," a description of which has been given to the House. It is beside my point to say what the difference was, but there was occasion for the issue of a now pattern, which included many improvements on points which had been warmly attacked by those who had doubts about the new rifle. I admit that the proposed Mark II. will be a better weapon. I admit that as the Government had decided to go on with the issue of a large number of the rifles it is little use "crying over spilt milk," but still I would suggest one or two points to the right hon. Gentleman to which attention should be turned. First, I would urge that he should carefully consider whether it is possible to enlarge the diameter of the bolt in order to increase the size of the cavity holding the mainspring, which could then be made with larger coils, and would be less likely to break in the way that breakages have occurred. Then in the magazine an improved and stronger spring should be introduced to feed the cartridges up into the breech—the existing spring in Mark I. is worthy of a child's toy—and a greater and longer grip given on the cartridge in the lips or top of the magazine, for it is a frequent occurrence that the cartridge is not delivered into the chamber. Then, will the right hon. Gentleman consider the desirability of introducing some system of charging the magazine from clips at one motion. The earlier methods of loading from clips, when the clips went into the magazine and the magazine could not be re-charged till all the contents of that clip had been discharged and the clip had fallen out, were undoubtedly faulty; but in the newer patterns the clip does not enter the magazine at all, it is pushed aside by the bolt as it closes, and the magazine can be re-charged at any time, and either from a clip or with single cartridges at will. Then, I would suggest attention to a "locking bolt," by which the rifle may be made absolutely safe when loaded.
 1076 1077
 MR. MARJORIBANKS : In asking leave to withdraw the Amendment I should like to say a word or two. I thoroughly recognise the efforts of the right hon. Gentleman to produce a perfect rifle, but I reserve my right to further criticism, as criticism has in the past been of great use to the Department.
 MR. PICKERSGILL : The official was one of a deputation which waited on the right hon. Gentleman, and he is thus punished.
(1.26.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : Some considerable time ago I placed on the Notice Paper a Motion to reduce the salary of the Postmaster General, and I then had the intention of placing before the Committee the grievances of the postmen. Happily, about a fortnight ago, the right hon. Gentleman forestalled me by the announcement which he then made, and the observations I intended to make on that head are no longer necessary. I do not propose to gauge the precise advantages for these postmen contained in the right hon. Gentleman's announcement; I prefer to wait and see what the practical operation of the changes will be. The right hon. Gentleman claims that he has made the postmen a handsome concession. Now, demur somewhat to the use of the word "concession" in such a case, though I am not at all surprised that the Postmaster General makes use of it, because his views of the relation between employer and employed are rather the views which obtained in the eighteenth century than those which characterise the last years of the nineteenth century. But the announcement thus made is of extreme importance from another point of view. It is a distinct admission that when the trouble occurred in the Post Office last year the postmen had reasonable grounds for their complaint. I do not wish to review the circumstances of the trouble last year, the serious breach of discipline—for strike it can scarcely be called; it was a breach of discipline followed by a lock-out on the part of the authorities. I never defended the conduct of the

 MR. E. STANHOPE : I can assure the hon. Member that that has nothing to do with this Vote; it relates to the Ordnance Factory Vote.
(5.10.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : I admit that the number of guns which we now have is a subject of grave importance. It is one which has been considered very carefully, and we have got as many field batteries as, in the opinion of all military authorities who advise me, are required for the whole of the Regular Army. We do not want them for the Militia, who, in the event of the mobilisation of the Army, would garrison our forts, and the Volunteers will be supplied with Artillery of their own.
(4.37.)  MR. E. STANHOPE : I think it is desirable that I should at once reply to some of the observations made on the magazine rifle. I will not attempt to follow the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Marjoribanks) into the details of the history of the magazine rifle, as everything I have to say on that point is to be found in a speech I made earlier in the Session. I will only remark that whereas people outside blame the Committee for not having approached the subject with an open mind, the account which the right hon. Gentleman has given proves that if anything the Committee had too open a mind. With regard to the ammunition, which I admit to be a matter of enormous importance, I have never disguised the fact that the provision of suitable ammunition is attended with great difficulty. No doubt for a long time the ammunition was not of that high character which it ought to have been. The manufacturers, probably from inexperience, were unable to supply compressed black powder of the same uniform quality as the previous ordinary black powder. At any rate, we have found considerable uncertainty in the black powder, and that to a great extent accounts for the fact that the shooting of the magazine rifle is not so superior to that of the Martini-Henry as was to be expected. But there is also the element that the troops are not yet accustomed to the weapon, and the further fact that the rifle to some extent has proved to be a puzzle, while the sighting is not like that of the rifles with which the troops have been familiar. I am, however, glad to say that we an; now obtaining much more uniform results with the compressed black powder now supplied, the shooting is infinitely better than it has previously been, and the ammunition we have recently been serving out has given results more satisfactory than in the earlier stages of the magazine rifle. I now come to the question of the smokeless powder. That is a question of great importance, and we
 1082 1083 "The rifles were issued to non-commissioned officers and trained soldiers on March 26, and have been in continuous use since that date. The firing exercise has been carried out constantly on the barrack square. The rifles have been left out all night, with magazines loaded, for 15 nights in succession, and the bores have not been cleaned since receipt of arms. Sand has been scattered over the action and into the magazine, whilst firing was going on, and water has been freely poured over the action (the magazine being kept charged) whilst 150 rounds were fired. Arms were piled, and then thrown down on the shingle, and the rifle repeatedly dropped with force, magazine being charged. The rifle generally is satisfactory, and an improvement over Mark I." "Rifles were exposed, without sight protectors, piled, and left in the rain all night, and fired next morning without cleaning. No difficulty was found in extraction or ejection of cartridges from rifles so exposed. On one day half the rifles were piled

 MR. E. STANHOPE : No; but I can tell the hon. Member the number of batteries in this country, namely, 53.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I have over and over again informed the House that they were converted into Martini-Henrys, having been re-bored.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : Decided to try it.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : All I have to say to that suggestion is that clearly that would be an illegitimate ground for invoking military assistance; but it is not possible for me to analyse the motives which actuate the Civil Authority in such a matter. I dissent, moreover, from the view that the War Office should exercise discretion, and should send troops or withhold them as they think fit. If the law is wrong, let it be altered; but while the law exists in

(3.45.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle) : Whether the Magistrates and police were right or wrong on the occasion referred to is a question I have not myself investigated, and I desire to express no opinion upon it. But whether they were right or wrong, they were clearly entitled, if they thought it necessary, to call for the assistance of the military in aid of the civil power. Now, the only suggestion of the hon. Member that raises any doubt on the subject is the suggestion that the troops were called on in order to save expense to the county.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : Since the hon. and gallant Member put the question last night I have seen the Quartermaster General, and he tells me that not a single complaint has reached the War Office as to the quality of the bread. He tells me he made special inquiries with very favourable results.
 MR. E. STANHOPE : I shall be very glad to give the Committee a short explanation of our proposals with regard to the Royal Artillery, which are just about to take effect. The Commander-in-Chief and I came to the conclusion some time ago that great necessity existed for strengthening the  personnel 1091 1092
(1.22.)  MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON  (Tower Hamlets, Stepney) : I take this opportunity to press upon the right hon.

 MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON : May I point out we cannot post a letter in the Lobby of the House of Commons after 6 p.m. if it is to be delivered the same night in the East End of London.
(1.37.)  CAPTAIN PENTON  (Finsbury, Central) : A few years ago an Act, called the Post Office Sites Act, was passed, and by it the London County Council were empowered within six months to make an offer for a portion of the site of Cold-bath Fields Prison, if they wanted to have it reserved as an open space. On the suggestion of the hon. Baronet the Member for Evesham (Sir R. Temple), the Select Committee which considered the Bill inserted a proviso requiring the right hon. Gentleman in the event of the offer being refused, and of the site being used exclusively for Post Office purposes, to hand over to the County Council the sum of £10,000, wherewith they might in the same locality purchase land for an open space. The Treasury, I am informed, are quite willing to hand over the money, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will consent, and not drive such a hard bargain with the County Council as to hold them to their offer for a site which is absolutely unsuitable as an open space. I would ask the right hon. Gentleman to communicate to the House the nature of Mr. Smyth's letter to the County Council on the subject.
(1.35.)  MAJOR RASCH  (Essex, E.) : I desire to call attention to an anomaly and injustice which exists in connection with the employment of Army pensioners or Reserve men in the Post Office, owing to the amount of their pensions being deducted from their wages. This deduction is obviously unfair, because the soldier has won his pension by meritorious services. The practice has led manufacturers and capitalists employing labour to follow the same system, and to deduct the amount of pensions from the pay of Reservists whom they engage. The right hon. Gentleman the Postmaster General receives an insufficient salary from a grateful country for
 1056
(5.23.)  MAJOR RASCH : I should like to draw attention to the item of £200, which it is proposed to vote to the Association for the Employment of Discharged Soldiers. This is the only Institution in the country which has been established with the object of procuring employment for Reserve soldiers, and I confess I have been astonished at the manner in which the Secretary for

(6.15.)  MR. GOSCHEN : If I am in order I would say, in reply to the question of the hon. Member (Mr. Cremer), that the suggestion he has made shall be communicated to the Admiralty.
(6.11.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I do not know whether I am strictly in order, but I desire to say that it is the intention of the Government that a certain contribution shall be made out of naval funds towards the entertainment of the French Fleet at Portsmouth. The Treasury Rules require that if any expenditure is incurred which is not provided for in the Estimates Parliament, if sitting, shall be notified of the fact. Accordingly, I now notify that a certain expenditure will be incurred which, we believe, will be met out of the surplus of other Votes. If not, a Supplementary Estimate will be proposed in the coming Session. I feel quite sure that the House and the country generally will be satisfied that a certain contribution should be made towards entertaining the French Fleet.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's,
 1100 : I have explained to the hon. Member that it is not possible to consent to this. The sub-section will not be necessary in many cases, but it is regarded as a protection. I am sorry I cannot accept the Amendment, but I do not think the hon. Member desires to press it.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I have explained to the hon. Member that I cannot accept this, and I understand that he will not persist if I give an assurance that when sovereigns have lost more than three grains in weight the Bank of England will pursue the same course they did in regard to the pre-Victorian coins. The three grains will be a guide to the Bank, and not a hard and fast standard. The same liberal method will be employed by the Bank of England in regard to Victorian coin as was employed in regard to pre-Victorian coin. I understand the hon. Member will be satisfied with this public assurance.
(7.18.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : I must remind the hon. Member that I reserved the right of private Members to bring forward their Bills, and I especially said that this was a Bill as to which some anxiety was felt on the part of the majority of Members in this House. The House will remember that although this is not our Bill, it is one in which the greatest interest is taken on both sides of the House. The hon. Member says it is a very contentious Bill. My own impression is that there are not ten persons in the House who are opposed to it, and that the number of its opponents is only two. It is a very small matter to withdraw the Motion for Adjournment in favour of the wish of the immense majority of Members, and on a question of great social interest. I appeal to the hon. Member to say whether he does not think he has
 1107
*(6.54.)  MR. GOSCHEN : There is no doubt the hon. Member has given great attention to this matter, but his proposal is one which must be dealt with with the very greatest caution. The hon. Member is not prepared to make a change with regard to the intrinsic value of our gold coins, but with regard to their weight and fineness. If his proposal were adopted we should have in circulation gold coins of two different standards of fineness, which, I think, would be a great disadvantage. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to consider what is the difference between the wear and tear of gold of 9–10ths fineness and that of 11–12ths fineness. The French Government have had experiments made on the subject, and I asked Professor Roberts-Austen to go to Paris and ascertain the results of those experiments. The experiments were made with the object of ascertaining the effect of various kinds of friction on coins made of gold of different standards of fineness with regard to loss of weight. A very ingenious machine was employed for the purpose, but I am bound to say that the results obtained cannot be regarded as conclusive, as it is impossible by means of a machine to represent the actual wear and tear to which a coin is subject. The experiments showed, however, that in the case of a coin of the English standard weighing 12·903 grammes the loss amounted to ·669 grammes in 30 hours, which corresponds to a loss of about £5 3s.8d. per £100. In the case of a coin of the Prench standard of the same weight the loss was ·656 grammes, representing a loss of about £5 1s. 8d. per £100. The difference in favour of the French standard was, therefore, slightly over 2s. per £100. But the wear and tear represented would be equivalent to the wear and tear of a life of 150 years. Therefore, it would be 150 years before the hon. Gentleman would realise the full saving of the change suggested. I

 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : In replying to my hon. and learned Friend, I have to say
 1104
 MR. GOSCHEN : The right hon. Gentleman having moved the Adjournment of the House is desirous of withdrawing the Motion in order that this matter may be discussed.
(5.28.)  CAPTAIN GRICE-HUTCHINSON  (Aston Manor) : I wish to support my hon. Friend's appeal, for I think the Government ought to increase their contribution to the funds of the Institution to £1,000. Under the present conditions of service a man serves with the colours for seven years, and is then drafted into the Reserve, just when he is becoming a thoroughly efficient and useful soldier. Many of these Reserve men find nothing to do, and roam about the country ventilating their grievances and deterring youths from enlisting. I certainly think this Vote might be raised to £1,000. There is one other point I think the Government might consider. We hear very much of technical education. It is being given in the cities, towns, and country districts. Why is it not given in the Army? Why not at the great military centres establish some system by which men of the Army may be encouraged to keep up the trades they may have
 1088
*(12.58.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE  (Bradford, Central) : It is one of the defects of a discussion occurring upon such an important Vote on the Report that the Minister is confined to one speech. It is therefore necessary that I should intervene between the speech of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Henniker Heaton) and the Postmaster General with some other topic. I trust that this course of taking the discussion on the Report will not be constituted into a precedent for the future. It is only the long duration of the Session that has induced the House to allow it upon the present occasion, and I would venture express a hope that the Government on another occasion will allow the Post Office Vote to be taken out of its ordinary course next Session so as to ensure a full discussion. I congratulate the Postmaster General upon the numerous and important changes which in the interests of the public he has effected within the last few weeks. These changes consist mainly of two classes—first, the improvements effected under the Post Office Act in the direction so often recommended by the hon. Member for Canterbury; and, secondly, the important changes which were agreed to at the Postal Conference in Vienna within the last few days, and which I presume were agreed to by the representatives of the Post Office of this country, and will receive the sanction of the Treasury before long. I believe the Postmaster General will agree in regarding them as most important changes. The changes effected have been late, but

 *MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I stated that I thought the Budget Estimate, judging from three or four years of Post Office revenue, was under-estimated by £200,000.
*(3.7.)  MR. SHAW LEFEVRE : I wish to make one or two remarks on the figures which the Postmaster General has given, which include both the Post Office and the Telegraph Vote. The right hon. Gentleman's figures show that, taking into account the receipts from both Services, and taking the estimated expenditure within the current year, there is still a net surplus of £3,371,000. As I understand the figures, with the exception of £4,000, the whole of that comes from the Postal Service. Therefore, I think I am justified in saying that for the current year the estimated net revenue from the Post Office alone will be about £570,000 over and above the average of the six years beginning 1880. In my opinion, the Budget Estimate of the receipts for the current year is under-estimated both in respect of the Postal and Telegraphic Services, and the result of my observation is that for the last four or five years it has been underestimated in respect of the Post Office by nearly £200,000. The fact is, that for the last four or five years the Post Office revenue has been increasing by leaps and bounds, and the average increase in that time has been about £450,000. The Postmaster General has twitted us with a desire to increase Post Office expenditure, but I think there is a great distinction to be drawn between the Post Office and other Departments in this respect. So far as my experience goes, there has never been any improvement made in the Service at a considerable expense which has not ultimately led to an increase of the revenue at least equal to the cost. Therefore, I think we may advise an increase of the expenditure of the Post Office without that reluctance with which we might be disposed to deal with an increase in

 *COLONEL BLUNDELL  (Lancashire, S.W., Ince) : The question of this rifle was very carefully considered by a competent Committee, whose President, Major General M. P.

 *MR. RAIKES : I have called for a Report on that subject. As to Scotland, I wish to assure hon. Members that holidays will be given in Scotland as in England. The question of the reduction of the rates between Calais and Brindisi is a matter that has always been present to the mind of the Department, and on two occasions during my term of office successful efforts have been made to reduce the rate. I listened with very great regret to the remarks which the hon. Member permitted himself to make with regard to one of the best of public servants, Mr. Buxton Forman, who has succeeded on two occasions in obtaining a considerable reduction of this rate. Our representatives at the Vienna Postal Congress were instructed to take steps to introduce the subject with the view of securing a further reduction in the rate; but they speedily discovered that the Congress declined to entertain the subject, and our representatives were left to negotiate as well as they could with the representatives of France and Italy. The existing arrangement, is for a term of years, and terminates at the end of this year, and I hope it may be possible in the meantime to obtain a farther reduction. The hon. Member for Canterbury is mistaken as to the constitutional enormity he thinks he has discovered in the making of a payment which did not appear upon the Estimates. As a matter of fact, the payment appears in the finance account, and, since the Committee sat, in the Report of the Postmaster General. It would be impossible that a balance of account as between the contracting Powers could be voted annually by the House. It is impossible for the decision of the House to bind the contracting Powers who have arrangements by Treaty with Her Majesty's Government. The amount is one which a Minister is bound to take into consideration as the outcome of arrangements made by Treaty. When the Treaty is made it is competent for the House to eject the Minister who has made it; but it would be practically impossible to strike a balance and present it to the House as an Estimate. I think I have dwelt on all the points raised. I apologise to the House for the length of my speech, and have to express a sin-
 1065 18. "That a sum, not exceeding £1,716,080 (including a Supplementary sum of £43,750) be granted to Her Majesty, to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March 1892, for the Salaries and Working Expenses of the Post Office Telegraph Service."
*(3.18.)  MR. RAIKES : Although the hon. Member cannot call attention to the matter now, I will not omit to consider it. I will not follow the right hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) into a discussion of the figures. I think it right, however, to point out that, although the estimated surplus of revenue over working expenses from the Telegraph Service last year was £101,000, yet there were deficiencies in the previous five years; and we are still £198,000 to the bad in dealing with the Telegraph Service as a whole. It is satisfactory to find that the telegraph revenue has recuperated in the way it has done, and I may mention that the recuperation exceeds the anticipations of those who were consulted upon the question. It is only five years since there was an actual loss of £145,000 in the working of the telegraphs in the course of the year, and we are now receiving a balance of £101,000. I am glad to notice the way in which the hon. Member (Mr. Henniker Heaton) has referred to the Order I recently issued. I think I exercised a rather arbitrary power in decreeing that "shan't" shall in future be charged as one word, because the basis on which these abbreviations have been hitherto charged is that they shall be abbreviations of one word; and while "cannot" is one word, "shall not" are two words. Again, as regards "St. Leonards-on-Sea," I have rather outstepped the rule which has hitherto governed this question. A compound word, when it is the name of a Post Office, is treated as one word. A telegram sent to "St. Leonards" would have been treated as one word. The words

 *MR. RAIKES : That is the opinion of the right hon. Gentleman, but I am dealing with the figures as the Government have got them. I would point out that our expenditure for the year, as against the increased revenue, shows an increase of about 180 per cent. The reason of this is to be found in the very comprehensive measures which have been framed in the course of the last year for the improvement of the position of the staff. Within the last year and a-half almost every branch of the Service has received a substantial accession of privileges. I agree with the hon. Member for Bethnal Green in what he said, and I have declined to use the word "concessions." The improvements which have been effected relate to the sorting clerks, supervising officers, the London sorters, and the three Crown Offices of Dublin and Edinburgh (the sorting officers and telegraph branches), the entire staff of female clerks in London and several other minor branches. Although there are some small branches to be dealt with, I may say that the last year and a-half has witnessed a complete revision of the scales of pay and the terms of engagement on the part of the public servants, and I do believe that these very large additions to their comfort and emoluments have been highly appreciated by the great body of the postal clerks. During the last few days the hon. Member for Bethnal Green frankly admitted that it has been my good fortune to announce a very considerable addition to the advantages of the postmen. From the very first moment of my being in office I have always been anxious to improve the position of the rural postmen, who labour under the disadvantage, as compared with their brethren in towns, of having no ascending scale of pay. To my mind they should have that element of encouragement in the performance of their duties—the prospect of increased pay. I am anxious to show what is the real disposition of the Department when I state that care will be especially taken, in dealing with these matters, of the position of the rural postmen. Other postmen, I believe, are very well pleased. I know that great enthusiasm has been shown in Liverpool in favour of the changes that have been carried out, and I sincerely hope and believe that in other

It would be unfair to punish one and not all, and I should be sorry to diminish the means of access to heads of Departments. This gentleman has been transferred for other reasons. The hon. Member for Finsbury has referred to the question of the land in connection with the Coldbath Fields Prison. I am sorry that any ground for complaint has arisen, but I cannot find it in my heart to take £10,000 from the general taxpayer and present it to any district in London. I was quite willing that the County Council should purchase it at a price. Then as to the conveyance of mails to different parts of Ireland, I assure hon. Members that their complaints shall receive attention.
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : With regard to the merits of the Bill, I would remind the House that it passed its Second Reading as a Bill which met with the general approval of the House. I know nothing whatever about the Bill itself, but a Saturday's Sitting is altogether an exceptional circumstance, and it was only for the purpose of facilitating Government Business that this Sitting has been held. Indeed, there has never been any Saturday Sitting except for the transaction of Government Business; and when such a thing does take place, except for the convenience that it is held for the purpose of getting through Government measures, the Sitting is in the nature of a Wednesday Sitting, which generally deals with nothing but Private Business. If, therefore, we adhered to the Wednesday Rule, which is, that Opposed Business is closed at half-past 5, this Bill could not now be taken. The

(3.49.)  MR. FLYNN  (Cork, N) : I desire to support the protest of my hon. Friends from Wales. It would seem that the authorities in Wales have taken a leaf from the book of the Chief Secretary for Ireland.

In view of all the circumstances, I think the War Office should be more reluctant to grant the use of an armed force to interfere in civil proceedings. There is

(3.13.)  MR. HENNIKER HEATON : I congratulate the Postmaster General upon having for the first time a surplus in connection with the Telegraph Service of this country. We are now, however, threatened with the same danger which we protested against in regard to the Post Office, namely, that of making a profit out of the Telegraph Service. As a means of preventing this trouble, I venture to ask the Postmaster General to carry out as early as possible a reform I know he is in sympathy with, namely, that of having an address not exceeding eight words sent free. That would be a concession which this country would very gratefully accept, and I should like to learn the views of the Postmaster General on the subject. I must also take this opportunity of complimenting the Postmaster General on the Circular he issued yesterday in regard to the Telegraph Service. Some time ago I called attention to the fact that while "can't" and "don't" are received as one word, such words as "shan't" are treated as two. The Postmaster General announces in his Circular that "shan't" will in future be regarded as one word. There are a large number of places in this country which have compound names. By a notice just issued by the Postmaster General "St. Leonards-on-Sea" is no longer to be

(7.31.)  MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : The Secretary to the Treasury has moved the adjournment of the House, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is going to oppose him. I know many hon. Members, who are strongly opposed to the Bill, have left the House, not knowing that the matter was to be brought on. It is not a Bill to do away with gambling, for infants will continue to gamble whether it is passed or not. No Amendments have been put down to the measure, I admit, but that is because no one expected that any effort would be made to pass it. If it is pressed we shall discuss it clause by clause.
(3.40.)  MR. J. O'CONNOR  (Tipperary, S.) : I desire to point out to the right hon. Gentleman that it is a dangerous practice to adopt, this of sending troops to engage in social troubles. We have been told by the hon. Member that we have not heard the last of tithe sales in Wales; and if that be so, I desire to point out how the interposition of the military on such occasions may arouse ill-feeling, and make the Army unpopular. It is absolutely necessary, for recruiting purposes, that the Army should remain popular with the great body of the people. We have seen the evil effects of employing troops in social disturbances in Ireland. It is a fact that in Ireland

(3.37.)  MR. DILLWYN  (Swansea, Town) : I support my hon. Friend in making a protest against proceedings which have given great dissatisfaction in Wales. The Welsh people have conceived the idea that the military were called in not for the purpose of quelling a riot, but in order to get up a case for bringing in the Tithe Bill. The Welsh people are eminently a law-abiding people, lovers of order, who give very little trouble to the Government. It is well known that the Prime Minister set his heart on passing the Tithe Bill, and it is supposed that these proceedings were for the purpose of influencing public opinion in favour of this Bill.

POWER  (Waterford, E.) : I wish to ask, on what principle are the contracts for the carriage of mails always given to the large companies in places where there are competing lines of railways? There is an impression that the London and North Western Company obtains more Government patronage in regard to the mails than other companies, and I should like to know what guides the Government in giving the contracts.

 MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : The anomalous system of making deductions on account of pensions has spread from the Post Office to other branches of the Government Service, and has become a very fruitful source of sweating.
(7.10.)  MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I wish to say a few words on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House. The greatest difficulty with regard to this question is to entertain anything like a sense of humour in relation to it, because, after a five years' struggle to deal with it, and at the end of a long Session, during which the House has sat for seven months, it would be in the highest degree ridiculous to regard it as a subject for humour. Although I have some sense of humour, I shall not endeavour to tax it now—
(5.32.)  MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM : I am sure the House recognises that when the hon. and gallant Member for Essex (Major Rasch) brings matters of this sort forward he does it with absolute sincerity. I consider it is a positive disgrace to any Government to allow men to fall into the unfortunate position that many discharged soldiers fall into. Although we may not agree with his ultimate conclusions, General Booth, in his book  In Darkest England

With the exception of Turkey, Portugal, and Brazil, where, however, little gold circulates, all countries use harder gold coins than Great Britain. I do not desire that the intrinsic value of our gold coins

 *MR. MONTAGU  (Tower Hamlets, Whitechapel) : On behalf of the hon. Member for Tax bridge (Mr. Dixon-Hartland), I beg to move the Amendments in his name.
 *MR. MONTAGU : The Chancellor of the Exchequer states that he cannot regard the French experiments as conclusive, and yet he has drawn his deductions from them. I would point out, however, that there are two different standards in France with regard to the silver, and I see no objection whatever to having two different standards of gold—one for the sovereign, and the other for the half-sovereign. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer is opposed to any alteration in so technical a matter, of course I cannot press it on the Committee, but I do not think the right hon. Gentleman has fully considered the great advantage of being in unison with the rest of the world on this subject.
(1.55.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : Several times in the course of the present Session I have had occasion to address to the right hon. Gentleman questions involving complaints by the officials employed in the post office at Belfast. I am glad, however, to be able to state that those complaints do not involve any reflection upon the Postmaster General. There exists what appears to be a well-grounded fear that the representations made by the staff of the Belfast Post Office have not been brought directly under the notice of the right hon. Gentleman, and I hope, therefore, the right hon. Gentleman will undertake to give his personal attention to them.
 MR. SEXTON : Has anything been done to re-arrange the duties in the Belfast Office?
(5.45.)  GENERAL GOLDSWORTHY  (Hammersmith) : I should be glad if the Secretary of State for War would tell us briefly what has been done in regard to the re-organisation of the Artillery. I also hope that during the recess the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give his attention to the condition of the retired purchase officers.
(5.20.)  THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT (Mr. BRODRICK,  Surrey, Guildford : I do not propose to follow the hon. and gallant Gentleman into the question whether or not these charges should be paid by the country. I should like to explain that the charge of £150 a year is made in accordance with the conclusions arrived at by Lord Harris's Committee, who examined into the subject exhaustively. In spite of the fact that these fees are paid by the cadets, there is still a heavy charge—something like £18,000 a year—borne by the public in connection with the Academy. If the cost of a cadet's education at Woolwich is compared with the cost of an education at a crammer's, or in any other high-class educational institution, I do not think that it will be considered unreasonably high.
(5.35.)  MR. BRODRICK : The hon. Member for Aston Manor (Captain Grice-Hutchinson) has suggested that we should raise this Vote from £200 to £1,000. The matter has been the subject of correspondence between the Treasury and the War Office, and the Treasury have pointed out that since the Government granted this sum of £200 a year to the Institution the subscriptions

(6.10.)  MR. BRODRICK : The hon. Gentleman has fallen into some little confusion in reference to the Regulations. The Regulations in regard to gambling have been, and will be, strictly enforced in the Army. The Regulation recently called in question was one concerning an officer who had not reported a certain occurrence to his commanding officer. In regard to gambling in the higher circles of the Army, the Regulations are strictly enforced.

I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether that Report is kept in mind? The special matter to which I ask attention is that upon which I have given notice—that of gambling in the Army. Of course, I will not now go into the question of Army Regulations or necessarily move a reduction. I find in the Army Regulations that all gambling in garrisons, camps, and cantonments is forbidden, and commanding officers are

*(5.57.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : At the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I did not last night move the reductions I had intended to do. The right hon. Gentleman suggested that I would have an opportunity to-day on Report, and he also offered that either he or the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would go through the Estimates with me privately. I shall probably keep the right hon. Gentleman to his promise, though I do not intend to deprive him of his holiday. Now, there are one or two joints I wish to raise on this Vote. I have scrupulously avoided making anything like an attack on the Government with regard to the private soldier; but outside the House there is a feeling that the private soldier is not in many matters treated so fairly or generously as the officer, and on this point I simply ask the right hon. Gentleman if he will, at any rate, consider the applications I have placed before him. So far as I am concerned, I should be glad if everything connected with war was done away with; until it is, we shall not have anything like a perfect world.
*(6.28.)  MR. MORTON : The House was good enough to postpone this Resolution last night, and I now ask the question of which I have given notice. I rather gathered from what the Vice President said that last year he had been paying money to the day training colleges, but I desire to have this point made quite clear. Also, I wish to ask a question in reference to the use of the Catechism in the Church schools, the extraordinary Catechism to which so much attention has been drawn. The Inspector signs the time table of the school. Would it not be well to require the school managers to insert in that time table in relation to the religious instruction what Catechism is used? There would then be the means of getting definite information when questions on this matter arise.
 *MR. MORTON : I wish to ask a question in reference to the appointment of our Representative in Roumania. The answer given by the right hon. Gentleman yesterday does not seem to be quite understood, and has been variously reported.
 *MR. MORTON : But is it possible for the Government to take money voted for one purpose and use it for something else?
 *MR. MORTON : I wish to move a reduction in regard to the first part of this Vote. The Naval Lords who are paid £1,500 also receive considerable sums as pensions, and I contend that while they are in receipt of a salary their pensions should cease. I also desire to include in my Motion a reduction of the salary of the Civil Lord of the Admiralty. This, so far as I can make out, is a sinecure office, and I must protest against the expenditure.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE ADMIRALTY (Mr. FORWOOD,  Lancashire, Ormskirk) : I can assure the hon. Member that the question he has raised in regard to the position and salaries of the Naval Lords has been duly considered. They receive half-pay for naval services in the past, and the salaries paid are not too high for the responsible duties they discharge. As regards the Civil Lord, it is quite clear, from the remark of the hon. Member, that he has little knowledge of the duties of the Admiralty Office. The duties of the Civil Lord include important supervision of many financial and administrative details.
 MR. FORWOOD : I will make inquiries. The number of allotments has largely increased in the last 12 months. I quite sympathise with the hon. and gallant Member's object, and I will see if it can be carried out.
 THE SOLICITOR GENERAL (Sir E. CLARKE,  Plymouth : With regard to this matter, I am sorry there should have been a misunderstanding in the conduct of the Committee. I certainly felt it was the duty of the Committee to go through the Bill, as it was referred to them, and that the question of any Parliamentary engagement made across the floor of the House should be dealt with in the House itself.
 GENERAL SIR F. FITZWYGRAM  (Hants, S.) : There is just one question I wish to ask in reference to the allotments paid to sailors' wives at the dockyard, Portsmouth. There is considerable discontent because they are required to attend to receive their allotments at a fixed time, and wet or fine the sailors' wives have to come, sometimes considerable distances, for the purpose of receiving their allotments. What I wish to ask is whether some more con-
 1097
(5.40.)  SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN  (Durham, S.E.) : I do not desire at this time to prolong the Debate, but I must say I agree almost entirely with what has been said by hon. Gentlemen opposite. There are one or two points in which those who feel an interest in the welfare of the Army would like to see a more sympathetic treatment on the part of the War Office.£1,000 would be too much to contribute to the Society, but I think it would be well if the War Office could see their way to graduate their contribution in proportion to the contributions of the general public. If the right hon. Gentleman would give us an assurance that he would adopt such a principle, he would soothe the feeling that our discharged soldiers are not met quite sympathetically. I understand that the Secretary of State for War has given most satis-
 1090
(7.5.)  SIR H. DAVEY  (Stockton) : On the Motion that this Schedule stand part of the Bill, I desire to say that I am not going to oppose the Motion, but I wish to express my surprise and amazement that the Bill should be reported to the House in its present form. A distinct engagement was made with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton by the First Lord of the Treasury, on the faith of which my right hon. Friend withdrew his block to the Bill. The Bill is not in the form in which my right hon. Friend understood it would be, and I think the circumstances ought not to pass unnoticed, because my right hon. Friend regards it as a breach of faith and of the understanding on which the Bill was allowed to be read a second time.
(7.22.)  SIR H. DAVEY  (Stockton) : I am somewhat surprised at the opposition offered to the consideration of this Bill in Committee, after the general acceptance it has met with in the House. I have been spoken to on the subject by many hon. Members from all quarters of the House, and I have found that there are only two hon. Members, namely, the Members for Dundee and Aberdeen, who are opposed to the Bill. There may be others, but if so I do not know who they are. I say, therefore, that this being a Bill which is accepted by the majority of Members in every quarter of the House, I must raise my voice in support of the request that we should not be put to the trouble of dividing on the Motion for Adjournment, but should allow that Motion to be withdrawn, and the Bill to be proceeded with. I may add that this Bill has been before the House for several weeks. Since it passed the Second Reading not a single Amendment has been put upon the Paper in opposition to it. I repeat, that from the communication I have had with hon. Members on both sides of the House the majority are satisfied with the Bill as it stands.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : Under certain regulations, savings under one head are transferred to another head of the same Vote.
*(6.20.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : I thought my statement was clear enough for anybody's comprehension. The head of the Legation at Bucharest will receive £3,500 a year, instead of £2,500, and it may be necessary to ask for a Supplementary Vote, but this may be set against the decrease of £1,400 in this year's Estimates.
(7.33.)  SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : I think the Bill ought to be discussed, and I hope my hon. Friend will withdraw his opposition to it.
 MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : Arising out of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement in reference to the visit of the French Fleet to Portsmouth, may I ask if any provision will be made for Members of this House to attend the Naval Review? I know there exists among some hon. Members a desire to be present and to pay respect to the Fleet of France.
(6.34.)  THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : As to the Vote for Training Colleges, there is simply a new sub-head under the Vote. As to the other question, the Inspector signs the time table simply as indicating that the provisions of the Conscience Clause are carried out; but with the character of the religious teaching given the Inspector has no power to interfere. It is laid down in the Code that it is no part of the Inspector's duty to inquire into the religious instruction given. I hope the opinions which have been expressed in reference to the particular Catechism the hon. Member has in view will effectually check its further use.
 SIR W. PLOWDEN : Can the right hon. Gentleman state what is the number of guns?
 SIR W. PLOWDEN : I understand we are on the question of armaments and stores, and I want particularly to draw attention to the condition of our Field Artillery. It is very difficult to get reliable information with regard to the armament of the Field Artillery, but the facts, so far as I can gather them, are that we have 31 batteries of Field Artillery in this country. For these the armament is complete. The batteries consist of 12-pouuder breech-loading guns, there being in all 228 guns, with 66 for the reserve. Now, taking our Force at 150,000 (as given in this year's Estimate) we have less than two guns per 1,000 men. Is that a satisfactory condition of affairs for our small Army? The smaller the Army the more efficient the Artillery ought to be. In foreign countries the percentage of guns is much higher, and seeing that we ought to take into consideration the Volunteer and Militia Forces, I contend that we should have many more guns to place our Artillery on an efficient footing. We certainly ought to have 1,000 guns. This is a matter of grave importance, and I hope the Government will give careful attention to it.
(5.6.)  SIR W. PLOWDEN  (Wolverhampton, W.) : I am sure that the House feels very great interest in our armaments, and I, therefore, ask leave to say a few words with reference to the Artillery. The Controller General, in his last Report, has drawn special attention to the difficulty he has in dealing with the Ordnance account, owing to the lateness of the date at which he
 1085
 MR. CHANGING  (Northampton, E.)  I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether a complaint has been made by Henry Stevens and Thomas Plummer, of Coventry, to the effect that on the 14th May last a fine of 20s. and 11s. 6d. costs was inflicted on
 1124
 MR. HAYDKN  (Leitrim, S.) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will explain why the Board of Inland Revenue decline to re-consider the cases of reduced officers of that Department until two years after the date of their reduction; how long this practice has been a rule of the Board; whether complaints have reached him of hardship arising out of the putting in force of this regulation; and whether, if on inquiry he finds that this rule exists and entails hardships on subordinate officers who may be reduced, he will advise the Board to rescind it, and re-consider the cases of such officers as have lost salary and promotion under its operation?
 MR. ANGUSSCTHERLAND  (Sutherland) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether arrangements have been concluded with the Highland Railway Company for carrying Her Majesty's mails for the period of the next five years; and, if so, whether he can state what improvements of the present Postal Service the Railway Company have undertaken to carry out, and the date from which they will take effect?
 MR. ELYNN : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury if he can state what is the present condition of the fishing harbour at Portstewart; whether he is aware that it is alleged by the local fishermen and others that, owing to its being exposed to gales from the west and south-west, the bar has got so filled up with sand and stones to such an extent that at ordinary spring tides the stones are nearly dry, thereby rendering it unsafe for the larger of the fishermen's boats; whether an engineer to the Board of Works has recently examined the harbour: and what Report has he made upon it?
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : I am opposed altogether to treating the Sanitary Authority as a criminal, and therefore object to any extension of that principle.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : The right hon. Gentleman has altogether omitted to allude to the word "wilful." If there is wilful neglect or default a fine ought to be imposed.
 1203
*(12.5.)  SIR W. GUYER, HUNTER : All the more reason why these certificates should be required. We do not want messengers as Sanitary Inspectors. But I do not want to say more. I have, I think, said quite enough to show the absurdity of the position of the hon. Member for Camberwell.
(12.20.)  DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : So far as I can follow most hon. Members who have spoken, there is nothing to be said against the Sanitary Institute. I think the more we endeavour to safeguard the health of the public by paying attention to sanitation the better; and if you have a Sanitary Institute, why not avail yourself of its services? The name of the hon. Member for Hackney (Sir Guyer Hunter) in association with the Sanitary Institute is a sufficient guarantee of the importance of that Institution, though the hon. Member does sit on the other side of the House. Nothing that has been said in my estimation undermines the Institute; accordingly, I think this proposal a very reasonable one.
(12.35.)  DR. TANNER,  (Cork Co., Mid) : I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer might have sought an opportunity of attacking the hon. Member for "Glamorganshire at a time when he was present, and not have tried to make capital out of this business by stabbing him in the back. Hon. Members for Wales thought it their duty to oppose the Bill because it was introduced in favour of what they consider to be an alien Church. I think the conduct of the right hon. Gentleman in stabbing them in the back is unmanly and unworthy the loader of the House.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to take this opportunity of pointing out to the right hon. Gentleman who happens to be the leader of the House, in the lamented absence of the First Lord of the Treasury, that a small Bill of great importance to the labourers of Ireland has been blocked and prevented passing into law; while the Government, by picking and choosing from among the private Members' Bills, have secured the passage of measures promoted by their own supporters. I must protest.
 DR. TANNER  (Cork Co., Mid) : I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether steps will be taken during the Recess to improve or alter the present limited and narrow kitchen accommodation in connection with the dining department in this House?
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing) : I shall be glad to do what I can to facilitate the wishes of those Members of Parliament who may desire to inspect; the French squadron that will be at Portmouth, but at present I have not received any intimation from Members of Parliament that leads me to suppose that any considerable number do desire to be so present.
 LORD G. HAMILTON : As so many Members have left town it is of little use putting a notice in the Library, but if hon. Members who desire to attend will write to the Secretary to the Admiralty, it will be ascertained how many desire to attend; and if a considerable number wish to do so, I will consider what can be done for their accommodation.
 LORD G. HAMILTON : If a notice were put up, hon. Members would not see it until to-morrow, and, in the short time left of the Session, they would be unable to take advantage of it. The best course will be to write to the Secretary to the Admiralty.
(9.42.)  THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR,  Manchester, E.) : The hon. and gallant Gentleman says he has brought forward this subject on the Appropriation Bill because he found it impossible to bring it forward on any Vote, but I think that in that he is mistaken. It seems to me that he might have brought it forward at some stage of the Estimates.
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Well, I do not desire to pursue that point any further. The hon. and gallant Gentleman appears to think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done great injustice to Ireland in not treating it in the same way as England. He seems to think that what the Chancellor of the Exchequer ought to do is to give Ireland the amount of money which she would be entitled to if her share of the public revenue were estimated according to population alone. But that would not be treating Ireland on a system financially identical with that of England. The real reason why Ireland cannot be treated identically with England is the same as the reason why Scotland cannot be treated identically with England, namely, that different Acts are required for the two countries, and that in certain important respects the financial arrangements of the two countries are not identical. If, for example, you have to deal with Irish education, it cannot be treated in the same Bill with English education, because Irish education is managed in a manner widely different
 1188
 MR. A. J. BALFOUR : Not a bit of it. If you were to find a fee grant corresponding in the case of Ireland to the fee grant for England, Ireland would not only not gain in the transaction, but would lose enormously. The principle adopted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is one far more beneficial to Ireland than the one which would logically follow from the hon. and gallant Gentleman's argument. The hon. and gallant Gentleman appears to think that population is a fair basis. I do not think it is. Surely the contributions to public funds and the money received from public funds are a fairer basis than mere population. But with regard to this subject the Chancellor of the Exchequer has prepared a very elaborate Report, which will in due course be laid before the House, dealing in detail with the numerous questions which the hon. and gallant Gentleman has raised. More than that, a Committee was asked for by the hon. Member for West Belfast and granted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but for some reason or other—not for any reason connected at all with the wishes and intentions and views of the Government—the Committee has never been set to work, and we have not been able to thresh out the question. Under these circumstances, it occurs to me that to attempt to discuss in detail upon the Appropriation Bill the accuracy or inaccuracy of the apportionment which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has arrived at is to ask the House to discuss what it has not the material to discuss. If the House is disposed to criticise the figures, the only way to do so is by a Select Committee.
 1189
 MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! I do not think that these remarks have anything to do with a Bill for renovating the gold coinage.
(7.9.)  MR. PARNELL  (Cork) : I had the opportunity on a previous occasion of saying nearly as much as I wish to say-on this subject, and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Wexford (Mr. Redmond) has since gone so fully into the case that I do not propose to go so fully into detail as I should have had to have done if I had moved the Motion my hon. and learned Friend has so ably, so efficiently, moved. But I cannot remain silent, as there are certain points in connection with this matter which impress me very strongly indeed, and which I cannot help thinking must have impressed the House, and, to some-extent, the Home Secretary himself. I regret exceedingly to hear that the right hon. Gentleman does not intend to reopen the case. I hope that that is not the definite conclusion he has arrived at. I hope that his mind will still remain open to any fresh facts that may be brought before him, supplemented by the information which my hon. Friend the Member for North Wexford has been able to obtain during his brief interview with Daly, and possibly supplemented by information which the Home Secretary may himself be able to obtain from the police in Ireland and in

 MR. PARNELL : We do not claim that all the men have been wrongfully convicted.
 *MR. RITCHIE : Section 70 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, which is incorporated with the New River Company's Act, 1852, provides that water rates shall be paid in advance by equal quarterly payments. The section has almost invariably been incorporated with Local Acts or Provisional Orders, by which Local Authorities or Water Companics have been authorised since 1847 to make charges for the water supplied by them. It is also incorporated with the Public Health Act, 1875, and therefore applies to cases where water is supplied by Sanitary Authorities under the general law. The effect of the payment of the water rates quarterly in advance cannot be to add to the capital of the company, as the water rates are applicable as revenue. The right to claim payment in advance
 1128
 *MR. RITCHIE : I have no information on the point why the companies should now avail themselves of their powers under the Acts for the first time, but undoubtedly they possess a power to demand a quarter's rate; in advance.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I do not understand the meaning of the expression "at the end of that time." Undoubtedly, the Acts in question do entitle the companies to charge a quarter in advance.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : The word is unnecessary, because in the Definition Clause the word "dairyman" is held to include cowkeeper.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I have received many complaints as to the neglect of the Sanitary Authorities to empty dustbins. I think it is only reasonable that the Sanitary Authority shall give proper notice of the time of the periodical visits for the purpose of removing refuse.
*(11.30.)  MR. RITCHIE : I hope the House will not adopt the somewhat dangerous course suggested by the Amendment. It is, I think, right and proper to give protection to a tradesman, who finds himself, by stress of weather or from any other cause beyond his control, in possession of food he thinks unwholesome, by enabling him to give notice at once to the Sanitary Authority to remove it; but, on the other hand, I think it is going too far to say that this notice shall be a bar to all prosecution. It is for the Magistrate before whom the tradesman may be summoned to judge whether the notice
 1205 bonâ fide bonâ fide,
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : The hon. Gentleman will remember, and the House may perhaps remember, that when this clause was introduced into the Bill on the Report stage I agreed to the clause, but said I thought it was of too drastic a character, and I reserved to myself the power in another place of altering its terms. I am bound to say I think there ought to be some penalty attached to the persons who perform their work negligently or carelessly, in such a way as to be injurious to public health. The clause, as it comes from the House of Lords, proposes that any person who undertakes work and does it imperfectly shall be liable to a penalty unless he can show that the defective work is not due to any default or negligence of the workman. Surely the House will not be prepared to go beyond that.
*(12.25.)  MR. RITCHIE : There are many cases in which the party proceeded against is really the least guilty—has, in fact, only the most remote liability—and I think it hard to say that under no circumstances shall the real offender be proceeded against for at least some portion of the damage or loss suffered.
 *MR. RITCHIE : That is what the clause does.
*(11.47.)  MR. RITCHIE : No, I cannot do that. When this point was raised before there was a general assent, and I think a special assent on the part of the hon. Gentleman, to the proposition that cases of infectious disease should be removed to the hospital. There is no reason for the clause so long as hospitals for infectious diseases are alone provided by the Sanitary Authority; but the time may come when the Sanitary Authority may find it expedient to provide hospitals for the inhabitants of the district for other than infectious diseases, and then the payment for the maintenance of the patient will be only reasonable. Amendment agreed to, as amended.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : I have communicated with the East London Waterworks Company on the subject of the hon. Member's question. I understand that it has been the practice of the company to make their rates half-yearly, one quarter in arrear and one quarter ill advance upon the valuation in force at the time the rates are made, instead of making and collecting them quarterly in advance as they are entitled to do. The effect of the practice is, of course, to anticipate by one quarter the effect of a new valuation list, whether as regards increases or decreases of assessment. I have no authority to determine whether the practice is legal or not, but the company are now in communication with their legal advisers, and I have received an assurance that if, in the opinion of those advisers, the practice is erroneous in point of law, the company will at once take steps to return any sums which may be found, in consequence, to have been overpaid.
 *MR. RITCHIE : If the hon. Member asks my own opinion, I should say it was neither right nor legal.
 MR. CRILLY  (Mayo, N.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he is aware that Mr. D. Dunn, P.L.G., of Rostrevor, County Down, accompanied by another ratepayer of the same place, waited on Mr. Horner, J.P., on Sunday, 12th July, to swear certain informations, and that Mr. Horner, "in the exercise of his discretion," refused to take these informations; whether it is the duty of a Justice of the Peace to take informations when persons attend in due course before him to make them; and whether, in the case of a Magistrate refusing to act magisterially, the Lord Chancellor will interfere and take note of the conduct of such Justice of the Peace?
 MR. CRILLY : Only on Friday Mr. Horner said he would take informations in the exercise of his own discretion. What I want to know is whether a Justice of the Peace in Ireland can, in the exercise of his own discretion, refuse to take an information.
 THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (Mr. PLUNKET,  Dublin University) : The House is aware that within the last two years a considerable improvement has been made in the ventilation of the kitchens of this House, and I should be glad to enlarge their accommodation also, but there is no means of extending the existing kitchens without very considerable and costly structural alterations, and during the approaching recess I shall have my hands full in carrying out the recommendations of the Committee which has
 1121
 MR. MADDEN : He cannot refuse in the exercise of any discretion other than an official discretion.
 MR. MADDEN : It is the duty of a Justice of the Peace to take informations; but I have no jurisdiction in the matter, nor am I invited to call upon this gentleman to give me reasons for the course he pursued in this particular case.
 MR. MADDEN : Yes; the Magistrates are under the control of the Lord Chancellor, who can call for an explanation.
 MR. MADDEN : No doubt very important duties are cast upon the Clerks of the Crown and Peace by the Local Registration of Titles Bill, which now awaits the Royal Assent. Since I introduced that measure more than two years ago I have had the advantage of conferences with a representative committee and with individual members of that body, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that the Clerks of the Crown and Peace are as a body entirely in sympathy with the Bill and thoroughly capable of working its provisions, under the direction and control of the Land Judge and the central registering authority. It does not rest with me, or with the Irish Government, to determine the question suggested in the fourth paragraph, but I may say that provision is made in the Bill for the exceptional instances in which the Clerk of the Crown and Peace is from any cause not qualified to discharge the duties of local registering authority, in which ease the Lord Chancellor is empowered to intrust the management of the office, for the time being, to a duly-qualified local solicitor.
 MR. MADDEN : I understand that the woman mentioned was arrested by the Sheriff's officer under an Attachment Order for Contempt of Court issued by the Land Judge. The Executive Government have no title to interfere in the matter. Any representation on the woman's behalf should be made to the Judge, who, no doubt, would give it full consideration.
 MR. MADDEN : The Irish Land Commissioners report that the originating notice referred to was served on them on 7th November, 1887. It was listed in due course for hearing last October, but was then adjourned on consent of the parties. The date for the next Sub-Commission sitting for the Union of Navan has not yet been fixed.
 MR. MADDEN : The Constabulary authorities report that their attention was called to the newspaper statement referred to; but that, upon inquiry, it was found to be most inaccurate and misleading; neither was it the case that the District Inspector was rebuked by the Magistrates.
 MR. MADDEN : The proposed extension and improvement of Crookhaven, County Cork, pier has been considered, but this pier being private property there is no power to take it up for repair under the Fishery Piers and Harbours Acts. Crookhaven, however, will be a congested district as defined in the Bill now about to become law, and the Inspector of Fisheries Report referred to will be brought under the notice of the Congested Districts Board at the proper time, who will, no doubt, give the matter careful consideration.
 MR. MADDEN : This is a matter which is not under the Irish Office, but the Treasury.
 MR. MADDEN : The Inspectors of Irish Fisheries report that the statement attributed to the Head Water Bailiff of the Tidal Division of the Waterford District, as to the disregard of the Salmon Fishery Laws in part of the district, is substantially correct. It would, however, be rather premature to consider what ultimate steps should be taken inasmuch as the inquiry is still proceeding, a further meeting of the Inspectors being fixed for this day at Waterford.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : The Commissioners of National Education report that the schools entitled to participate in the local taxation grant, examined in April, were all paid in due course with a few exceptions. These few cases, which required special consideration, are at present in course of payment.
 MR. MADDEN : The matter referred to by the hon. Member is one for the Treasury rather than for the Irish Government.
 MR. MADDEN : It has been arranged that the relief works in the Electoral
 1136
 MR. MADDEN : I understand that the Magistrate mentioned complained to the constable that the man named had been obstructing the foot-path by keeping his horse upon it. The constable, upon satisfying himself that the man subsequently persisted in the obstruction, charged him with the offence. The penalty inflicted by the Magistrate was not as stated in the question, but a fine of 2s., including costs, which the man subsequently paid at the police barrack, and which was then handed over to the Town Commissioners' Clerk.
 MR. KNOX : I beg io ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether his attention has been called to the Judgment of Mr. Justice Holmes, at the Londonderry Assizes, in the matter of the Lough Erne Drainage Works, in which the learned Judge is reported to have said—
 "The Drainage Board was placed in a most difficult and peculiar, he might go so far as to say impossible, position. The Board was subject to actions from the occupiers of land above the sluice if the gates were not opened in proper time, and on the other hand they were subject to actions from the people below if the water was discharged without reasonable precaution. How such a project could have been brought out at the immense expense it had been was one of the mysteries which a person in his position was unable to understand;" 1133
 MR. KNOX : Has the right hon. Gentleman read a fuller report, which was given in the  National Press?
 MR. KNOX : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether mails from Enniskillen, Clones, &c., to Dublin and Belfast are now carried by the 6 a.m. train from Enniskillen to Dundalk, there connecting with the train which leaves Belfast for Dublin at 7 a.m. and the limited mail train from Dublin to Belfast; and whether provision will be made for a continuance of this service by providing an earlier train to connect with the proposed new express service from Dublin to Belfast, or otherwise?
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether the Board of Works have made to the Board of National Education a statement that the funds at the disposal of the Board of Works for building, enlarging, or otherwise improving vested school houses are now exhausted; whether sufficient funds for that purpose will be proposed to be voted during the present Session; and whether, in considering applications for such grants, those which have already been refused owing to lack of funds will be first considered?
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the sentence of penal servitude for life passed on Ann Turner, convicted at the Leeds Assizes of being accessory after the fact to murder; and whether, as it would appear that the offence was committed by the prisoner in order to screen her son, and as she herself gave information to the police after an interval of three days, he will give effect to the strong recommendation to mercy which the jury coupled with their verdict of "guilty"?
 MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recommendations have been made by the Committee which has recently inquired into the position and conditions of service of prison officers?
 MR. PICKERSGILL : Yes; but the difficulty is to get people into the hospitals, and this clause provides that a person shall be liable (or his representative) for maintenance. Bat the right hon. Gentleman will say, "Not if the patient is suffering from an infectious disease." Then the clause is unsatisfactory, for a reason he has himself given. As a matter of fact, a Sanitary Authority does only establish a hospital for infectious diseases, so there is no necessity for the clause, and it may have a mischievous effect, raising an element of uncertainty as to whether the person maintained in the hospital was really suffering from an infections disease. I hope, therefore, the right hon. Gentleman will omit the clause.
 MR. PICKERSGILL : I admit the reasonableness of the case put by the right hon. Gentleman, but my objection is to the sweeping nature of the Amendment.
(12.22.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : At this hour of the night I will not divide against this Amendment, but I must say it appears to me to be of a very objectionable character. The Amendment in the most light-hearted way runs a
 1213
(11.45.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman proposes to agree with this Amendment. It really raises again a question which was thoroughly discussed upstairs and in the House, and on both occasions a most decisive opinion against the clause was arrived at. There was no point upon which we were more unanimous than that in the public interest it is necessary, so far as it is possible, to isolate in hospitals persons suffering from infectious diseases.
(10.51.)  MR. PICKERSGILL  (Bethnal Green, S.W.) : I cannot understand why the word "cowkeeper" should be left out. Surely there are cowkeepers who are not dairymen.
(10.54.)  MR. PICKERSGILL : I should like to call attention to the additional obligation imposed on the Sanitary Authority, coupled with a penalty of £20 if it is not complied with, by placing upon them the duty of giving notice of the time at which refuse would be removed. I think no inconvenience has resulted from the absence of such notice; and as the proposed penalty is a considerable one, I think we ought to have reasons for the alteration.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. E. STANHOPE,  Lincolnshire, Horncastle) : This ease has been fully considered, and it has been decided that Mr. Murphy is not entitled to a pension.
 MR. DE LISLE  (Leicestershire, Mid) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the new buildings proposed to be added to the South Kensington Museum include "suitable accommodation" for the pictures of the Chantrey Bequest; whether he can inform the nation, through the courtesy of the President of the Royal Academy, what is the number of pictures already purchased under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest, and what is their estimated approximate value; and whether, in case the estimated value of the pictures is greater than the estimated cost of providing suitable accommodation, Her Majesty's Government will take steps at once to carry out the terms of the Chantrey Bequest, with a view to acquire a full title to the
 1120
 *MR. DE LISLE : In consequence of the reply of my right hon. Friend, I beg leave to give notice that I will call attention to the subject next Session and move—
 "That, in the opinion of this House, the time has come for the Nation to acquire possession of the pictures and statuary purchased under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest by the 'provision of suitable and proper buildings or accommodation for their preservation and exhibition as the property of the Nation.'"
 MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON  (Tower Hamlets, Stepney) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been drawn to another serious accident to a child (seven within three months) through falling out of the carriage of an excursion train while in motion; and whether, seeing the serious increase in these cases, he will advise Railway Companies to place an extra handle and hook to the doors, as adopted in all Continental railway carriages?
 MR. WOOTTON ISAACSON : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in view of the resignation of Captain Shaw, Chief of the Eire Brigade, whether Her Majesty's Government will consider the expediency of attaching that gentleman to some Department of State, in order that his valuable services may be retained for the benefit of the country?
(11.34.)  MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE : If there is no intention to punish a man who in a  bonâ fide 1206
 MR. GAINSFORD BRUCE  (Finsbury, Holborn) : It has never been the policy of our law to make an accidental act a criminal offence. All the clause says is that although the onus of proof is on the builder, if he is able to show that the act has not been done wilfully or intentionally he shall not be liable to a fine. Surely that is reasonable. It is quite possible to make a law that is so harsh that it cannot be enforced.
*(10.1.)  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I have only one or two words to say in reply to the hon. Member for West Belfast. He must be aware that during a great portion of the Session the Irish Members, and others who are specially interested in Irish affairs, have been so occupied with the Land Purchase Bill that it would have been almost impossible for them to consider in Committee the question of the financial relations between the two countries. Since then, although there has been a desire expressed to proceed with the inquiry, the appointment of the Committee has, as is well known, been frustrated by the action of the Members from Wales. The hon. Member asks why the Government have not produced the materials which have been collected in anticipation of the discussion of the subject. The reason is that we have thought it wise to wait until the Returns can be absolutely complete. The materials now collected relate to the years 1889–1890 and 1890–1891. We thought it well to wait for the information for the year 1891–1892, which will comprise the results of the new census and the Estimates for the current year. The information will, therefore, be quite up to
 1193
 MR. GOSCHEN : I hope in two or three days.
 *THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I can assure my hon. Friends behind me that the Government regret extremely that they have not been able to carry this Bill. But all who are acquainted with the ways of the House must know that at the end of the Session it would be impossible to carry it in face of the opposition of a few gentlemen, chiefly from Wales. It is a matter of astonishment that they, in the face of the general feeling with regard to this Bill, should have thought it worth while to oppose the first four clauses, which commend themselves to everyone who is in favour of decency and morality among the ministers of the Church. I trust that nothing will be lost by the postponement of this measure, and that nothing will occur in the next few months to make us regret that the measure has not been passed. I can assure my hon. Friends that it is certainly the intention of the Government to give effect next Session to the general policy of the Bill.
 MR. GOSCHEN : It is well known that Captain Shaw is an officer of distinguished administrative ability, but I know of no vacant office connected with any Government Department where his services could at present be utilised.
 *MR. GOSCHEN : I am not aware of the facts stated in the question.
 MR. GOSCHEN : Reduction is a punishment reserved for offences of a very serious character indeed. It is clear that if an officer were restored to the position which he hold, and from which he was reduced, after only a short interval, the punishment would not be very severe; nor would there have elapsed a sufficient time for the officer to have retrieved the character he had lost. The Board of Inland Revenue have therefore laid down a rule that no officer who has been reduced can be restored to the rank he has forfeited until two years have elapsed from the time of his reduction. This rule has been in force for some years, and is not considered to inflict any hardship whatever.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I fear that it will be impossible, in view of the great opposition to this Bill, to proceed with it this Session; but in withdrawing it it should not be understood that the Government have any intention to abandon the general objects it was intended to attain. The Government, in withdrawing the Bill, reserve to themselves the power of reintroducing the measure at an early period next Session.
 MR. GOSCHEN : No, Sir; it would not be possible to give a day for that purpose.
 MR. GOSCHEN : No, Sir; we cannot possibly give a day; we have no day that it is possible to give.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I regret that the hon. Gentleman should think that any disgrace attaches to him. The House is aware of what has passed, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the feeling towards him is a kindly one. We should regret that any further acrimony should be introduced into this matter. It is perfectly natural that the hon. Gentleman should feel somewhat acutely; but I trust he will accept the assurance I have given him, and that he will allow the painful incident to terminate.
 MR. GOSCHEN : I do not know that the Government have any control over the fate of this Bill. I can only repeat my wish that it may be passed; but the opponents of the Bill have put down a large number of Amendments; and if they are to be discussed, there is not much hope of passing the Bill. It is
 1141
 MR. GOSCHEN : That question might be answered by asking whether it is fair that a very small minority of Members should persistently oppose a Bill which I believe the great majority desire to pass?
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN, St. George's,  Hanover Square) : No special provision has been made in the plans of the new buildings to be added to the South Kensington Museum for the Chantrey Bequest pictures; but the additional space which will be at the disposal of the Science and Art Department will enable them, if the pictures remain with them, to hang them to better advantage. Fifty - four pictures and seven works of sculpture have been purchased under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest, at a total cost of £39,245. The subject of the last part of the hon. Member's question must be considered in connection with the proposed British Art Gallery, and I cannot at present give any undertaking with reference to it.
 MR. HOWELL  (Bethnal Green, N.E.) : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board if his attention has been called to the fact that the East London Waterworks Company, and other London Water Companies, have been charging on the new assessment, which came into force in April last, increased rates for the three months preceding the date of such assessment coming into force; and whether this demand for such increase by the Water Companies is legal?
 MR. HOWELL : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he thinks it right or legal that, as the company collect the money half-yearly, they should charge consumers on the quarter preceding the period when the new assessment comes into force?
 MR. ATKINSON : May I respectfully say that I was drummed, as it were, out of the House, although there were eight guests of mine within the House. I was not considered sufficiently respectable to remain in the precincts of the House during the time of the suspension. Therefore, I must have the odium which attaches to my name debated and either confirmed—in which case I will give up my seat—or the entry struck out of the Minutes of the House.
 MR. ATKINSON : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman who is leading the House at present if I may have a day to move that that which has been put on the Journals of the House respecting me may be expunged? because I would rather die than be disgraced, and I shall continue to use every opportunity upon every Bill until the matter is discussed, and until the House, which has passed sentence on me without hearing me, hears the case.
 MR. ATKINSON : May I ask the Speaker if he will kindly give me a day to bring on my Resolution No. 1?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) , who had on the Paper the following Notice of Motion:—
 "That this House, having heard the statement of one of its Members, hereby expresses its disapproval of the right honourable the Speaker's discourtesy in not replying at all to a constitutional inquiry of the said Member very respectfully worded; and further ox-presses its opinion that a Member of Parliament who asks (1) the Speaker, (2) Mr. Milman, (3) Mr. Jenkinson for a ruling or precedent as to whether a Notice is in order or not, is unfortunately situated if he waits one hour for a reply from one or other of those officials, gets none, and is then ruled out of order,"
(6.50.)  MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I do not speak with any personal knowledge of these cases, because hitherto I have put my trust in those whose duty it is to investigate them, and when voting I have followed their lead. But I think the hon. and learned Gentleman who introduced the subject has made out a case for mercy. Inasmuch as I have lately had an opportunity of ascertaining that the right hon. Gentleman who is now answerable for reviewing these cases will not look mercifully into the cases of Englishmen who have merely walked in the streets in order to do good to the bodies and the souls of their fellow creatures, I will not follow the right hon. Gentleman when he stands up and says that he will not have mercy. I have myself, though a Visiting Justice, been prevented from going down and investigating cases in my own constituency. I pity poor men who are suffering penal servitude as these men are. When the Member for Derby was at the Home Office he was afraid that a piece of dynamite might explode near his portly person, and so the police used to pounce upon ladies when they came to the House and take their reticules from
 1167
(10.45.)  MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : The hon. Member for Whitechapel has addressed the House as an expert on this subject, and nobody has listened to him. That conveys to my mind the fact that 500 out of the 670 Members of this House do not understand the subject on which the hon. Member has just spoken. The Chancellor of the Exchequer ought to be in the House. If it is not worth his while to defend his Bill in the House, it is not worth our while as Members to pass it. I ask the House to signify their disapproval of the right hon. Gentleman's absence by refusing to pass his Bill. I shall take a Division on the Bill if my hon. Friend opposite does not. I consider the measure very crude, and think the criticisms of the hon. Gentleman opposite are founded on right and justice, and, therefore, I shall support the hon. Gentleman and vote against the Bill. I have been for 27 years the Chairman of a prosperous bank, and I say that if the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not think it worth his while to defend his Bill he is deserving of defeat, and I shall help to inflict it on him.
 MR. ATKINSON : But I have.
(10.24.)  SIR H. JAMES  (Bury, Lancashire) : As regards this Amendment, it is regarded as an important one by the operatives. It springs out of the clause which entitles them to receive particulars of the work they are about to do. In the course of the discussion on it, it was pointed out that the information might be sold to a rival employer, and trade secrets thereby disclosed. It was suggested that persons disclosing information given under the power of the clause should be liable to a penalty, and the Lords' clause carries out that view. The operatives have no objection to it, but they think that a person who induces a man to disclose the information should also be liable to punishment; that the tempter should be punished as well as the tempted. The Amendment I intend to propose will secure that, and will provide a double defence for the employer. We are willing to accept the Lords' Amendment if thus amended.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Agreed. I entirely assent to the principle that the briber as well as the bribed ought to be punished.
(10.9.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I move that the House disagree with this new clause, which has reference to the power of County Councils to provide for the inspection of workshops and the enforcement of sanitation therein. The Bill provides for the inspection of workshops by the local sanitary Inspectors, and if the Sanitary Authorities should be remiss in performing their duties the Home Secretary is empowered, under Clause 1, to send Government Inspectors to do the work. By this new clause it is proposed that the unhappy occupier of premises used as a workshop shall be worried and harried by another set of Inspectors
 1194
 MR. MATTHEWS : That is an absolute misstatement of fact.
*(5.15.)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : I do not complain either of the Amendment or of the speech in which it has been moved, but I am bound to observe a considerable reserve in what I say, whilst the hon. Member is perfectly free to say what he chooses. The allegation that Daly and Egan are not indicted for dealing with dynamite, but were indicted for treason-felony, is in one sense true; but one count of the indictment set forth that the prisoners, knowing of the existence in the United Kingdom of a treasonable association called the Irish Republican Brotherhood, had aided and furthered its principal object—the overthrow of the authority of the Queen in Ireland—by procuring and having in their possession dynamite shells with intent to employ the same in the furtherance of the aforesaid
 1152 1153 "The jury might ask him how he got the bombs. He could invent a story, as the police had done, but he should not do so." 1154 agents provocateurs 1155
 *MR. MATTHEWS : With all respect to the hon. Member, I cannot accept those statements of Daly's even if they were reasonable in themselves. But those statements are not such as any reasonable man could accept. It seems to me that to alter the result of the trial much more than more statements is required. The hon. Member asks me to make full inquiry, but I have not hoard anything from the hon. Member which I have not already inquired into. I have an enormous correspondence connected with the case, and if I were to state fully to the House all the circumstances which, after minute inquiry, came to my notice, I am sure I would convoy to the minds of hon. Members the impression strongly left upon my own mind, namely, that the suggestion that the bombs were planted upon Daly was a piece of absolute imagination. The sentence passed upon Daly was by no means a severe sentence, having regard to the character of the offence of which he was found guilty. Treason-felony is one of those mitigations of the law due to the humanitarian feeling of modern times, and it is only because the old punishment was somewhat repugnant to modern feeling that the Act was passed altering the law. Although the hon. Member might with truth call it a political offence, treason-felony remains a very grave offence; but when treason-felony is accompanied by the employment of such instruments and means as Daly in his
 1156
 *MR. MATTHEWS : The verdict of the jury was guilty upon all the counts, as far as Daly and Egan were concerned.
 *MR. MATTHEWS : In order that there may be no misunderstanding on this point I may be allowed to say that I did not intend to impute misconduct of any sort or kind to Chief Constable Farndale. I do not think I used language that conveyed that. I stated the occasion on which the Chief Constable's expression was used, and that was when the Watch Committee wore complaining that everybody connected with the case had not been arrested. I inquired as to the Chief Constable's grounds for the impression he formed. The reasons of the Chief Constable wore sent to the Home Office in writing, and they were the basis of my inquiry. The Chief Constable had not the solo or, indeed, the principal conduct of the inquiries going on about Daly, and had nothing to do with the endeavour to arrest Daly. But on examining the Reports I came to the conclusion that the Chief Constable was wholly mistaken.
 MR. MATTHEWS : It was accidental that they were there.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have seen a newspaper report of the case. I have not as yet had time to make any inquiry into the circumstances, and am not, therefore, at present in a position to express any opinion on the case.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The hon. Member is probably not aware that I replied to a similar question on the 28th of July. I beg to refer him to the answer which I then gave.
 MR. MATTHEWS : The answer to the first question is in the affirmative. If the allegations of the complainants are well founded, the convictions can be quashed; and I understand from the Magistrates' clerk that an application is about to be made for the purposes Pending this, which is the proper remedy, any interference of mine would be improper.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E.) : Yes, Sir. The facts are as stated in the first paragraph. The conviction in the case of Barker and Deacon was quashed on the ground that they committed no actual assault, but the Court held that the assault by Lambert was proved. If any facts are brought to my notice in extenuation of Lambert's offence I will give them my careful attention. I am informed by the Prison Authorities that these men were not received into custody until the 23rd of June, and they have no knowledge of any application made by Mr. Donovan. The Magistrate also informs me that the application was not made at his Court, and that, when the prisoners were remanded on bail, the statutory recognizance fee of 2s. 6d. was demanded and paid. The men were liberated as soon as the recognizances were entered into, which was the earliest moment that they could in law be released.
 *MR. RAIKES : Terms have been arranged with the Highland Railway Company for a new contract for a period of five years. Under this contract there will be a material acceleration of the down day mail from Perth, which mail, now due at Wick and Thurso about 5 p.m., will be due shortly after 1 o'clock. Power is also taken to

 *MR. RAIKES : The postal arrangements of Enniskillen wore, until Saturday last, substantially as described in the hon. Member's question, but on Saturday certain changes were made in the working of the train from Enniskillen (over which the Department has no control), which will somewhat modify those arrangements. Bags from Enniskillen, &c., will now reach Belfast  viâ 1134
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University) : The adult unestablished staff of the Post Office consists almost entirely of persons who do not give their whole time to the Department, or of persons who are ineligible, on the score of age or health, for established appointment. The few unestablished persons who do not come within either of these categories, as also the large class of boy messengers employed in the London postal service, are eligible, under such conditions as may be prescribed, for employment in the established force without competition when opportunity arises, subject in every case to their obtaining the necessary certificate of qualification from the Civil Service Commissioners. Members of the unestablished staff are not entitled to promotion, and do not receive a rising scale of wages. Officers of the Post Office are remunerated for their work in selling Inland Revenue and other stamps by an additional allowance, the amount of work so performed being taken into account when their salaries are fixed.
 MR. STEPHENS  (Middlesex, Hornsey) : the hon. Member for Hackney may be right that the Sanitary Institute is not an association of amateurs and faddists; but he cannot deny that it is a private venture society, and that it would not be fitting for us to endow it in the way proposed. This clause is to be objected to on many grounds, especially because, after 1895, you will shut out from qualification for the post of Sanitary Inspector the persons experienced in the work of sanitation in our large towns—and it must be remembered that experience earned in towns of over 25,000 inhabitants is of no common order, while, on the other hand, qualification by education is very doubtful and insufficient. No proper facilities exist for teaching sanitation, nor is there at present any body for examining. Therefore, I think the clause should stand as it is.
 MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the
 1127
 DR. FITZGERALD  (Longford, S.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he is aware that Mrs. Doherty, wife of Pat Doherty, on the Tenalick Estate of Lord Annaly, in the County of Longford, was arrested on the morning of the 8th July for taking possession of her house, was lodged in Carrick-on-Shannon Gaol, and still remains in prison without trial; and whether he will take steps to have this woman, who is 58 years of ago, and the mother of a large family, released?
 MR. FLYNN : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether the works on the relief road Bohola, County Mayo, are stopped or about to be stopped; and, in view of the fact that this necessary work is nearly completed, whether the Irish Government will authorise this work to be proceeded with for an additional week or two until it is fully completed?
 MR. FLYNN : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether, under the Local Registration of Titles (Ireland) Bill, parties are bound to register all dealings relative to land with the Clerks of the Crown and Peace; whether these officials are now bound to attend to all their official duties in person, including regular attendance at the Quarter Sessions, as

 MR. HAMMOND  (Carlow, Co.) : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade if the Great Southern and Western Railway Company allow the cesspayers of Carlow credit, in determining the amount of the baronial guarantee for a proportion of the revenue derived from the transit of passengers and goods to or from Rathvilly and Tullow, on portions of the railway other than that between Baltinglass and Tullow?
 MR. KELLY : That Inspector until recently was a messenger in the City.
(11.57.)  MR. KELLY : The House will now see that the Sanitary Inspector is to be the holder of a certificate from such a body as the Local Government Board may approve. The Amendment which has been moved loaves matters precisely where they are, because nobody, I believe, can got a certificate except through the Sanitary Institute; and this body, it seems to me, is merely an association of faddists and amateurs. There is a Council, but it cannot be pretended that the Council understand all the details of sanitary work and inspection. There are alternate requirements for the appointment of Inspector. He must have been engaged for three years cither as an Inspector in London, or in an urban district of 20,000 inhabitants. But why this limitation? Why is a. Sanitary Authority to be deprived of the service of an efficient practical man because his qualifications do not comply with these conditions? There may be a most efficient man in a small town, or an inefficient man in a larger (own. Why should the Local Authority be so hampered in their choice?
(12.32.)  MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I am afraid that the Government out of deference to the wishes of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid Lothian, postponed this Bill so often that at last it became an impossibility to pass it. I look upon the loss of the first four clauses of this Bill as little short of a national misfortune. Nonconformist ministers, like the clergy, agree that immorality on the part of a clergyman is a blow against religion and against their faith, and a more cruel slander upon them was never uttered than when the hon. Member for Glamorganshire declared that they wished to maintain immorality in the Church of England as a lever for the Disestablishment movement. In conclusion, I ask the Government for the fullest and amplest pledge that the measure will again be brought forward early next Session and passed, whatever sacrifices may be necessary.
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : The question is, what is meant by "sufficient notice"?
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, K) : My hon. and learned Friend talks about a man accidentally constructing a defective drain. If a man does that he is not fit to be a builder. I trust the House will remember that the punishment is not that of imprisonment, but of a fine not exceeding £20. I think we can trust our Magistrates to use the power properly, and not to impose £20 or any but a nominal fine in trivial oases.
(11.25.)  MR. KELLY : As the House knows, there is no more difficult question than that of diseased meat. No one wishes to shelter a man who sells or exposes for sale diseased meat, but, on the other hand, I am sure the House will like to draw a distinction between a person who wishes to sell diseased meat and the unfortunate person who happens to find himself in possession of unsound meat. The clause provides that when found unwholesome food may be removed as if it were trade refuse. I submit that when a man gives notice that he has an unsound article, and has no intention whatever of selling it or exposing it for sale, he should be relieved from the unhappy consequences of having the food removed by the Sanitary Authority. I invite the House to remember that the fact of being summoned before a Magistrate and having the case reported in the newspapers is a far greater punishment on a tradesman than the infliction of a fine. I therefore beg to move to add to the Lords Amendment—
 "And any person who shall have duly given such notice and made such request shall not be liable to conviction under this Act."
 COLONEL NOLAN : When will they be presented?
(9.7.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I desire to say a few words on an important subject, which I have found a

 COLONEL NOLAN : They would get 10s.
 COLONEL NOLAN : No; the subject comprises many different Votes. Certainly I might have brought it forward piecemeal on about 10 different Votes.
 COLONEL NOLAN : I did not say it could.
 COLONEL NOLAN : No, no.
 COLONEL NOLAN : I spoke against it.
(9.40.)  MR. J. O'CONNOR  (Tipperary, S.) : The right hon. Gentleman has not answered the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Wexford, as to whether Mr. Farndale, the Superintendent of Police, is still in the employment of the Government or not? He has passed lightly over whatever information that gentleman gave to the Government, and I am sure that was a strong part of the case emphasised very much indeed by my hon. Friend. There was no charge made against the Home Secretary, or his predecessor, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, as to the employment of  agents provocateurs 1157 1158 Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire 1159 "I have no hesitation in stating that the general treatment of prisoners in Chatham Prison is an intolerable disgrace to the whole prison system." 1160
 MR. J. REDMOND : The jury did not find him guilty of the dynamite offence at all, but of treason-felony.
 MR. J. REDMOND : I gave everything that was important.
(4.15.)  MR. J. REDMOND  (Wexford, N.) : I rise for the purpose of moving—
 "That, in the opinion of this House, the time has come when, in view of the peaceful state of the country, and the lengthened term of imprisonment already served by John Daly, Egan, and other persons, now suffering sentence" of penal servitude for treason-felony, a re-consideration of their sentences should take place, with a view of recommending the extension towards them of the clemency of the Crown." 1142 1143 1144 1145
*(12.29.)  MR. J. G. TALBOT  (Oxford University) : I wish that the Government had had sufficient determination to press the Bill to a Second Reading. It would have been carried almost without objection, because the opposition conies from a few hon. Members who I can scarcely believe would have ventured to vote against it. The Bill raises no points of religious controversy, but merely deals with questions of morality and decency. I do not believe that the Nonconformists as a body oppose such a Bill, and I hope that the Government will introduce it again at the beginning of next Session. I very much regret that another six months will have to elapse without a Bill of this kind being passed. I do not believe it is opposed by any considerable section of Nonconformists. Indeed, I think the opposition to the Bill is fragmentary and infinitesimal; it is a slur and a slander on Nonconformists to say that they refuse to give the Church of England this reasonable and moderate protection against a small but very obnoxious class of offenders in its ranks. In the name of religion, in the name of the clergy, and in the name of all who desire the protection of the Church, and I may add the whole community, from indecency and immorality of this kind, I earnestly protest against the withdrawal of this Bill.
(6.10.)  MR. J. NOLAN  (Louth, N.) : My hon. Friend the Member for Wexford drew attention to the very great obstacle which stands in the way of Securing the sympathy of this House and of the 'Government for these prisoners, owing to the fact that they have been found guilty of a crime which excited a good deal of horror in the minds of the people of this country generally. One of the strong things in connection with the case is that Daly and his friends always indignantly repudiated having any connection with the dynamite conspirators. It is difficult to create any body of public opinion in this country in favour of clemency to an Irishman convicted of political offences; whereas it is always possible to do so in favour of an Englishman, Scotchman, or Welshman. Let US try to realise what the feeling would be on the part of the people of this country if they hoard that an Englishman, found guilty of a serious offence against morality, had, by the carelessness of prison officials, been brought three separate times to the verge of death. That is the case of the prisoner Daly, and yet I observed that the Home Secretary passed over as a matter of no consequence the fact that the belladonna supplied for use in the prison was of a strength with which the official who dispensed it was unacquainted. Three doses were given to Daly, who in consequence suffered frightful agony, and, in the loneliness of his prison cell, found himself face to face, as he says, with the Great Unknown. Irishmen have shown their readiness to risk great dangers and to undergo great sufferings for their country, but they have generally no sympathy with what is called the dynamite conspiracy. I have attended meetings that have been held in this country and in Ireland, and know that the prevailing impression amongst my fellow-countrymen is that Daly is entirely innocent of the dynamite part of the charge brought against him. Daly would have been prepared to take up arms at any cost for the purpose of obtaining the separation of Ireland from England, but Irishmen feel that he is not guilty of the dynamite part of the charge. I and many of my colleagues would have been better pleased with the Home Secretary
 1162
 MR. DILLWYN  (Swansea, Town) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it is the intention of the Government to make any progress this Session, or at any future time, with the Clergy Discipline (Immorality) Bill?
 MR. HAYDEN : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether there is any fund out of which the lock keepers on the Ballinamona and Ballyconnell Canal can be compensated for the loss of the salary of which they have been for some years deprived; and if he could say whose duty it is to keep the lock houses in repair?
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : The Board of Trade have no knowledge of the matter referred to in the hon. Member's question, as they have no duties in the determination of the baronial guarantee. Their functions are confined to the appointment of an auditor in respect of the Killorglin and Castleisland branches of the Great Southern and Western Railway, and arbitration in respect of the Killorglin branch.
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : Yes, Sir. I have received with regret the Report of the accident referred to. I could not advise Railway Companies to adopt the Continental system of placing outside fastenings to the doors of railway carriages. I think such a system would be much objected to by the travelling public in this country. I think those in charge of these children's excursions ought to arrange that some person old enough to keep the children out of mischief should be in each carriage, and that one of the doors should be locked.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W.) : Yes, Sir. I have granted the licence referred to; but the licence does not convey the power to practise vivisection.
 MR. P. O'BRIEN  (Monaghan, N.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he is aware that Mr. William Parker, J.P., Clones, recently ordered a constable to charge a man named Irwin with having a horse standing for sale in a public fair at Clones at a place alleged by the Magistrate named not to be the proper place for the sale of horses; that Mr. Parker sat in judgment in the case and fined Irwin 10s., or, in default, seven days' imprisonment, although Irwin protested against the fine on the ground that he was within his right, and the custom at Clones Fair, to exhibit his horse at the place, and offered, if time were given him, to produce horse dealers and other witnesses to prove his contention; and that Mr.

*(6.55.)  MR. P. O'BRIEN  (Monaghan, N.) : I bog to support the Amendment, and to express a desire to hear what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bury have to say on the subject. I will give the House my own experience. I am a citizen of Liverpool, where I have lived for 15 years. No fewer than three attempts have been made by the Irish Police in Liverpool to entrap me. I have been in business in Liverpool for a considerable time, and have been connected with every constitutional political movement of my countrymen there. For that reason, I suppose, I got a little more attention than I desired from the Royal Irish Constabulary stationed in Liverpool between 1883 and 1885. During that period I on three occasions was informed that small boxes had arrived for me from New York, and was asked if I would not call for them. But I was not to be caught. I knew that in business I could not receive any parcels from New York, and consequently I did not call for them. Subsequently, an officer, whom I had no difficulty in identifying as a detective, came to my office and asked why I had not called for the parcels. I asked the man to call a second and a third time, and eventually told him if he did not leave some of his

 *MR. P. O'BRIEN : You were referring to the dynamite conspirators.
 *MR. P. O'BRIEN : I think that the right hon. Gentleman is unfair in dragging the Phœnix Park murders into this discussion.
 MR. p. O'BRIEN : I must remind the right hon. Gentleman that Daly did say that he knew where the information came from, but that he would not say who the person was.
(6.30.)  MR. PIERCE MAHONY  (Meath, N.) : A very serious statement was made by Chief Constable Farndale, and the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary made an observation as to this Chief Constable's reason for his declaration which struck me as being very peculiar. He said the Watch Committee
 1163
 MR. PIERCE MAHONY : It was no accident that 20 or 30 police were waiting at the station. Were there 20 or 30 at each of the other stations? I think it is a far more likely story that the police purposely lost sight of the man—that they knew the house he had gone to, that they had information from the owner of the house as to when and where he would arrive, and that they were, therefore, ready to arrest him. I hope that, in any case, the right hon. Gentleman will not refuse us the evidence or the reasons which induced Chief Constable Farndale to make this serious statement to the Watch Committee of Birmingham, and that he will give us an opportunity of judging for ourselves of the evidence which induced him not to credit Chief Constable Earn-dale's statement. So much for the case of John Daly and Egan. Now, as regards the general case of all these prisoners, I think the House will agree with me that, however much we may condemn the deeds of which these men were accused, and of which they were found guilty by a Coroner's Jury—and no one can condemn such deeds more strongly than I do—their acts were not performed with a selfish motive. Their's was not
 1166
 MR. PIERCE MAHONY : I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the interruption. Chief Constable Farndale is the head of the Birmingham Police, and therefore an officer in a very responsible position. A graver accusation than that made by him against the Irish Police—that the person who gave the dynamite to Daly was in their pay—cannot be conceived. What I would ask the House to realise is this: What would have been the effect of this
 1164 1165
 MR. PIERCE MAHONY  (Meath, N.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he is aware that Mr. Christopher Nulty, of Fargenstown House, Navan, County Meath, applied to the Land Commission to have a fair rent fixed In October, 1887, but that his application has not yet been heard; and whether he can state when a Sub-Commission will next sit in Navan?
*(8.2.)  MR. HALDANE  (Haddingtonshire) : I feel very strongly the responsibility of the vote I have made up my mind to give, and I ask the House, therefore, to allow me to state my reasons for it. I think it is to be regretted that much of the Debate has been wide of the Amendment, which simply recommends a policy of clemency. Reasons have been urged which have gone, for the most part, to the Tightness of the conviction. On that part of the case I do not entertain much doubt. I listened carefully to the arguments advanced with a view of impugning the finding of the jury in the cases of Daly and Egan, and it seemed to me that the answer of the Home Secretary was conclusive. There is no doubt that Daly, at all events, had the control of explosive materials which were to be used unjustifiably.

(7.48.)  MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM  (Lanark, N.W.) : I wish to say a word or two on this question, because I consider I have a duty to discharge in regard to it. I was returned to Parliament by Irish votes, simply because I was "Mr. Parnell's candidate." There are some Members on the Benches near me who seem to have drunk mandragora, and to have forgotten that they were returned to this House simply as voting machines for the Member for Cork. For my part, I have not cultivated a Cork or even a Limerick brogue in order to endear myself to an English constituency; but I have never for a moment forgotten that I was given a seat in this House in order that I might take part in the discussion of Irish affairs. I notice that the Party which has made so much political capital out of their alliance with Irishmen has not been rising like trout at May-flies to take part in this discussion. I am not astonished at the remarkable silence of hon. Gentlemen on this side of the House, nor even at the high old crusted speech of the right hon. Gentleman the ex-Home Secretary. I have always noticed that on occasions

*(10.31.)  MR. MONTAGU  (Tower Hamlets, Whitechapel) : Although I take a great interest in this currency question, I do not propose at this advanced period of the Session to occupy the time of the House with any lengthened observations. When the Bill was introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the last hour on a Wednesday there was no opportunity for discussing it, and on the Motion for the Second Reading I was induced to abstain from speaking on the promise that an opportunity should be afforded me on the Third Reading. But a criticism of it cannot be so effective at a stage when its passing is a foregone conclusion. This is a permissive Bill, the operation of which will take a long time, and it may be that the Chancellor of the Exchequer next Session will bring in a complete measure with regard to the currency which will materially affect this Bill and satisfy my friends in the City. I am very disappointed with this Bill, and so are my City friends; its introduction has been greatly delayed on the understanding that it was to be a comprehensive measure of currency reform; and this Bill in no way answers our expectations. Although it has been under the consideration of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for years it is a meagre Bill, not at all worthy of a Chancellor of the Exchequer with a commercial education. The speech of the right hon. Gentleman at Leeds produced the belief that we were to have an immediate issue of £1 notes to save the wear of gold and to provide a reserve of gold, so that we might not in future incur obligation to
 1197
 *MR. MONTAGU : May I explain that I have no desire to oppose the passage of the Bill?
 *MR. MONTAGU : Of course, Sir, I bow to your ruling at once. But I desire to point out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has raised the alarm with regard to the gold reserve and has done nothing to provide a remedy. To my mind the Bill is entirely unsatisfactory, because it provides no remedy for existing defects; neither does it provide for future deterioration. No provision is made for keeping our currency in proper order. It does not alter our system, of coining gold without charge, while all other countries make a small charge for mintage. A charge of even a halfpenny on the sovereign would prevent many millions of gold coin from being melted down and the selection of the heavy pieces for melting, which

 MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that William Barker, William Deacon, and George Lambert were convicted at the Thames Police Court, on the 16th of June, for assault, ill connection with, a trade dispute, and sentenced by Mr. Mead to two months' hard labour each; and that, on appeal, at the Clerkenwell Sessions, on the 31st July, without any evidence
 1123
(10.11.)  MR. SYDNEY BUXTON  (Tower Hamlets, Poplar) : So far as I have been able to judge of the Debates on this Bill, the sympathies of the Home Secretary have throughout been on the side of the occupiers rather than with the unfortunate workpeople. The right hon. Gentleman's argument is that this clause gives another authority power to worry and harass the occupiers. Bat as I read it, this will only be done in case of default on the part of the Local Sanitary Authority. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will remember that this Bill, as it stands, places the workshops in a less satisfactory condition as regards inspection than they were before the Bill was introduced. Certain classes of shops have been taken from under the control of the Home Office and placed under the Local Authority. I admit it is true that the Home Office may resume its power over them, but that will only be done in exceptional cases. We want that there shall be some authority over and above the Local Sanitary Authority to see that the latter does its duty. The Home Secretary must remember that his colleague the President of the Local Government Board has already inserted in his Public Health Bill a clause similar to this, giving the London County Council considerable power over the Local Sanitary Authorities, and if such a principle is to be applied to London, I cannot see why it should not also apply to County Councils throughout the Kingdom. I hope the House, sympathising with the unfortunate workers in these workshops, who will be in a worse position under this Bill than before its introduction, will agree to this-new clause.
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON  (St. Pancras, N.) : I hope my hon. Friend who has moved the Amendment will be content with the clause as it has come from the Lords, which I think practically carries out what he desires. The Bill as it left this House was not quite fair to the builder. A builder acts according to the plans and instructions of an architect, and it would be monstrous to inflict on the builder carrying out plans that are not well designed the consequences of constructing drains according to those plans, but which turn out to be unsatisfactory.
*(11.32.)  MR. T. H. BOLTON : I would suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that a tradesman who has meat which has gone bad, and who has given notice of this, should not be liable to a summons. If the right hon. Gentleman docs not desire that there should be proceedings taken in such a case, then I do not see the harm of inserting the Amendment. It might perhaps be qualified by stating that the notice shall be  bouâfide, bonâ fide,
 *MR. T. H. BOLTON : I think the House should hesitate before passing this clause, because it creates a strict monopoly with reference to an existing occupation. It gives a monopoly to existing sanitary officers, and provides that all future sanitary officers shall pass an examination before some body not at present constituted. It places these occupations entirely in the hands of the Local Government Board. The Local Government Board may authorise the Sanitary Institute to hold these examinations, or may authorise some other body. It seems to me that to pass in this general Act of Parliament a clause creating this monopoly would be a very hasty proceeding. I yield to no man in this House in my desire to see capable and efficient men discharging this duty. I do not think the Vestry of Camberwell have displayed very much judgment in selecting a man for this position of Sanitary Inspector, who, from his antecedents, would probably not be the most suitable person to discharge the duties, but it would be rather hard
 1211
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I am sorry to have to move the withdrawal of this Order, but the Attorney General's Amendments are such that the Belfast Chamber of Commerce would prefer to see the Bill dropped rather than accept them.
 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : Then the contract expires in July, 1892?
 MR. SEXTON : The money would have been lost to Ireland for ever. I am, therefore, glad that the right hon. Gentleman postponed dealing with the matter until next Session. The right hon. Gentleman has now pledged himself to give the money to free education. He has promised to bring in a Bill for the purpose. If the matter had been dealt with this year, we should only have had the limited opportunity afforded by the Vote in Supply of discussing the question. In that way it would only have been possible to raise one Debate. Now, however, the right hon. Gentleman has bound himself to proceed with the matter by means of a Bill. We shall next year, therefore, have the opportunity of discussing the principle of the right hon. Gentleman's proposal on the Second Reading of the measure, and in Committee we shall have the opportunity of making alternative suggestions. During the progress of the Bill through the House the Irish teachers, and those interested in education in Ireland, will have an opportunity of examining the question in all its bearings. They will have gained by the postponement. Before I sit down I would repeat again the disappointment I have experienced, owing to the failure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to carry out his promise to appoint a Select Committee to consider the financial relations of the three portions of the United Kingdom. He made that promise last year in the Budget Debate, but the rest of that Session and the whole of the present Session have passed, and nothing has been done. It is no excuse to say that one Welsh Member, or a section of the Welsh Members, desire Wales to be included in the inquiry. When the right hon. Gentleman assented to the inquiry he knew very well that it would be in the power of any group of Members, or any one Member, to stop the Committee being appointed if the Motion were brought on after 12 o'clock at night. He should have provided for that contingency, and, by not doing so, I maintain that he has not kept his promise. Pending the appointment of the Committee, the right hon. Gentleman has been preparing material for its consideration when appointed, and some time ago he promised us that this material
 1192
 MR. SEXTON : It would be impossible to establish one rule for the basis of taxation and another rule for the reduction of grants. It is a perfectly conceivable thing that a country may be sparsely populated, and yet able to boar taxation; and, on the other hand, it is clear that—as was the case in Ireland during the famine period—a country may be very thickly populated, and yet be unable to bear any taxation at all. In fact, such is the condition of Ireland that the fact that there is an extensive population in some districts, known as the congested districts, so far from being a reason for taxation, is rather a reason for relief from taxation. If the theory were correct that population should be taken as the basis of taxation, at the time of the Union of Ireland and Great Britain, Ireland, which then had 5,000,000 of population, whilst England had only 10,000,000, would have been responsible for something like one-third or one-fourth of the taxation of the united Kingdom. That fact alone is sufficient to dispose of the theory of the hon. and gallant Gentleman. Bat I agree with the hon. and gallant Gentleman that it is not just to proceed, as the Treasury do year by year, in estimating the revenue of Ireland. I found from the close and careful study I gave last year to the Return of the 7th May regarding the incidence of taxation that wherever I could light upon any ground of presumption that presumption was upon the side of the more powerful partner, the benefit being always to England, and the prejudice going to Scotland or Ireland. It may appear by-and-bye, when we get our Committee, that my conclusion is not well founded. I hold that the judgment of Mr. Giffen is sound. That gentleman looked into the matter, and formed the opinion that, having regard to the relative capacities of the two countries, Ireland should pay 4½ per cent. of the Imperial taxation instead of 9 per cent. The hon. and gallant Gentleman (Colonel Nolan) appears to think that Ireland has lost something by the postponement of the education grant, but I can assure him that the contrary is the case. If the Chief Secretary had dealt with this grant in a temporary way, as he himself declared it would have been, by way of applying it to the Reserve Fund under the Land Purchase Act, how would the
 1191
 MR. SEXTON : But the hon. and gallant Member must see that he will have to take it both ways; and that if population is to be the basis for abatement, you must make it also the basis for taxation.
(9.52.)  MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman that it is not our fault if we have not seen the Returns so long since promised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am inclined to agree with the right hon. Gentleman that in the absence of the Return to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred, an exhaustive or even a useful Debate upon so difficult, detailed, and complicated a question as the Imperial taxation of Ireland can scarcely be had upon this occasion. The hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Galway has been so long awaiting this opportunity of expressing his views that I have no doubt he has carefully considered the subject. Yet I would invite him to re-consider the view that the population of Ireland as compared with that of England can be made an equitable basis of taxation.
 MR. SEXTON : Can the Secretary to the Treasury answer the question?
 MR. SEXTON : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether he is aware that Mr. Cowen, late county surveyor of Mayo, changed the plans and specifications of Achill Viaduct so as to render the work much more difficult and costly to the contractor (Mr. Patrick Sweeney) than those laid down by the former county surveyor, Mr. Edward Glover, who originally drew up the said plans and specifications on which the contractor undertook the execution of the work; whether the contractor has been obliged to substitute steel for iron, of which it was originally intended to construct the bridge, and

 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether his attention has been drawn to the report in some of the provincial papers in Ireland that, at a meeting lately held in New Ross, in the County of Wexford, by the Inspectors of Irish Fisheries, the Head Water Bailiff of the Conservators of Fisheries in the Waterford District stated on oath that there was an utter disregard of the law in part of the district; that fishing for salmon by nets was openly carried on on Sundays and other close times with impunity; that he could not, with the means at his command, cope with it; and that the administration of the affairs of the district by the Board of Conservators was altogether "a humbug;" and, if so, will he take any steps, by legislation or otherwise, to strengthen the hands of the Inspectors of Fisheries in such cases?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland if the attention of the Inspector General of the Royal Irish Constabulary has been called to the language used by District Inspector Rogers, Royal Irish Constabulary, Carrick-on-Shannon, to his men in the Petty Sessions Court, as reported in the  Roscommon Herald
 MR. HUNTER  (Aberdeen, N.) : Is it fair, after so many Members have left London, to push a private Member's Bill of such a contentious character?
 *MR. JACKSON : I have no objection to make inquiry into the matter; but I think I have already answered one or two questions with regard to it, and the information I have received is not quite in accord with that which has been supplied to the hon. Member. The Board of Works have considered the matter, and are of opinion that the contractor has no grievance. It is the county, however, that is responsible, and not the Board of Works.
 *MR. JACKSON : I do not know that there is any variation this year, as compared with previous years. It is necessary to avoid a condition of things that would be hardly creditable, namely, that grants in excess to a considerable amount should be made. Application is made to the Commissioners of National Education, who grant the money after a conference with the Treasury. As a matter of fact, the amount of money supplied has hitherto proved adequate to meet all cases. Although a grant may be made now it does not necessarily come into charge during the year. The expenditure does not take place until a long time after the grant has been made, and I do not think that any inconvenience really results.
 MR. JACKSON : The funds at the disposal of the Board of Works for National school buildings for the present year are not exhausted, but notice has been given that they are only sufficient to meet grants already made; no applications have been refused, though some are necessarily postponed. Sufficient funds have been already voted. The responsibility of making grants rests with the Commissioners of National Education, and I am quite sure that they will take into account every circumstance in determining the claims to priority of the several applicants.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : The clearing out of the stones referred to is a work of maintenance which should be carried out by the County Authorities, to whom the harbour has been transferred. As the Grand Jury has declined to do the work, it will be carried out by the Board of Works and charged to the county.
 *MR. JACKSON : I know of no funds from which the lock keepers referred to could be compensated, even if they have a claim to compensation. The canal is not vested in any Government Department, but in Trustees. The canal has never been used for navigation purposes, and the works have been for many years abandoned by the Navigation Trustees,
 *MR. JACKSON : No, Sir; I have not had the advantage of seeing that journal. I am only able to give the information at my disposal.
 *MR. JACKSON : I do not find that the quotation given in inverted commas by the hon. Gentleman is quite accurate. I have not been able to obtain an authoritative report, but I have made this extract from the  Freeman's Journal "Mr. Justice Holmes to-day delivered an important Judgment in a number of cases brought against the Lough Erne Drainage and Navigation Works, by occupiers of land at Ballyshannon, for flooding, caused, as alleged, by the defective construction and negligent management of the works. His Lordship held that there was no negligence shown since the completion of the works, and for damages sustained during the construction he gave judgment for small sums. He found for the defendants in the cases for alleged damage since the completion of the works."
 *MR. JACKSON : Yes, Sir; but it will be continued after that date.

(6.2.)  MR. W. A. MACDONALD  (Queen's Co., Ossory) : There are two questions before the House. The first is the treatment of these men, and the second is the justice or injustice of their sentences. As to their treatment, I am satisfied from conversations I have had that men who have suffered for Fenianism have for some reason or other been treated more brutally than they would have been if sentenced for any other offence. I am satisfied from statements made to me by men of honour and integrity that England treats her political prisoners worse than any country in Europe except Russia. The right hon. Gentleman did not for a moment deal with the point that Daly belonged to a party of Fenians that was strongly opposed to dynamite. The right hon. Gentleman has to show why this sudden change took place in the opinions of Daly on the subject of dynamite. Why were these prisoners, Daly and Egan, instead of being tried under the Explosives Act, tried under the Treason Felony Act? You try them for treason-felony, and, in order to increase the sentence which might be inflicted on them, you bring forward this matter of dynamite. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that these men were guilty of concealing this dynamite, I ask the House what is the use of continuing these sentences to the bitter end when there is now no dynamite conspiracy and no thought of dynamite? Surely the fact that the necessity for the sentences has ceased ought to influence you in extending the clemency of the Crown to these men. Nobody now denies that, whether by accident or by design, Daly was most cruelly treated when he was in Chatham. Have you determined that you will carry out the sentence to the bitter end in spite of this consideration? Surely humanity is not entirely banished from the minds and the hearts of the people of this country. We had hoped that the feelings of bitter enmity between the nations were gradually fading away. Why keep an open sore like this, when by an act of clemency and humanity you can do something to heal the sore and to bring back goodwill, kindness, and fellow-feeling between the
 1161
 MR. W. A. MACDONALD : I regret that an Irish Education Bill has not been introduced this Session, so that we might have had time to consider it in the recess. The subject is one of very great complexity, many interests are involved, and therefore the Bill ought to have been introduced in order that the country might have had plenty of time to consider it before next Session. I understood that the right hon. Gentleman had pledged himself to give us that opportunity.
(8.13.)  MR. W. McARTHUR  (Cornwall, St. Austell) : I have never voted on a similar Resolution before, and it is quite impossible for me now to give a silent vote. I agree very largely with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Haddingtonshire. I confess, apart altogether from the question of general clemency being extended to  quasi
(10.26.)  MR. TOMLINSON  (Preston) : I hope that the Government will assent to this Amendment.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : That is just what I have been saying. That statement of Daly's referred not to an  agent provocateur, 1178
 SIR W. HARCOURT : I was speaking of secret societies—of dynamite associations and of assassination associations—and I maintain that in order to put down such secret societies it is necessary to secure the co-operation of the police of the United Kingdom.

 SIR W. HARCOURT : I do not, of course, know what information the hon. Member has on the subject; but, as far as I am concerned, I maintain that I was right in saying that these secret societies were organised in Ireland.
 SIR W. HARCOURT : The hon. Member for Cork has said that he put forward that proposition as applicable not only to the cases of Daly and Egan, but to the other dynamite prisoners, such as Whitehead and Gallagher. Whitehead was a person who had carried on at Birmingham the manufacture of dynamite on a large scale for the purpose of its being used for explosions, and Gallagher had been engaged in similar work in London. These were men of the most dangerous kind, and I fail to see that their offences became less heinous because they had added to them the crime of treason-felony. It must be remembered that it was due to such men as those that the explosions took place in Westminster Hall, and in other places in London, and in my opinion the fact that they had also been guilty of treason-felony aggravated rather than diminished their guilt. It is not necessary that I should go in any detail into the cases of these prisoners.

(7.30.)  SIR W. HARCOURT  (Derby) : I shall only occupy the attention of the House for a very few moments after the very able and exhaustive speech of the Secretary for the Home Department, which I regret the hon. Member for Cork was not in his place to hear. The hon. Member for North Wexford has brought forward this subject in a most moderate and temperate manner, and doubtless he has merely endeavoured to lay before the House his own convictions on this subject. Neither of the Resolutions that stand upon the Paper in relation to this question alleges that these men have been wrongfully convicted; all that is suggested is that the time has come when, in view of the peaceful state of Ireland and the lengthened term of imprisonment already served by the prisoners in question, a re-consideration of their sentences should take place, with the view of recommending the extension towards them of the clemency of the Crown. The proposition of the hon. Member for Cork and of the hon. Member for Wexford, therefore, is that men who have been rightly convicted shall now be released because of the peaceful state of Ireland and of the lengthened term of imprisonment they have suffered.
(8.11.)  MR. WALLACE  (Edinburgh, E.)  I shall, as on a former occasion, vote in favour of further inquiry, because I believe it is desired with practical unanimity by the Irish people. What is asked is not private inquiry by the Secretary of State, but such inquiry as will carry conviction one way or the other that justice has at length been done. It seems to me to be bad policy, and contrary to the view that Ireland should be governed according to Irish ideas, to refuse this persevering and strong demand for inquiry made by the Irish Members on behalf of the Irish nation.
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I should like to say with regard to this I have a letter to the effect that if the duty is imposed of giving notice of the exact time the cart will call for the refuse it will be impossible for the Sanitary Authority to comply with the obligation cast upon them. They cannot state the exact hour or minute of calling. I therefore hope the Government will not insist on this clause, since it will only inflict immense inconvenience on the authorities.
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : But in 99 cases out of 100 there is no plan at all: the builder does the work without any instructions from anybody. My experience in London causes me to believe that this clause will not be a bit of good unless you make it as drastic and as harsh as you can.
 MR. GOURLEY  (Sunderland) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether any, and, if so, what, arrangements he intends making for Members of both Houses of Parliament who may desire to attend the visit and review of the French Fleet?
 MR. F. S. POWELL  (Wigan) : If a person has unwholesome meat on his premises, and is quite innocent in regard to it, then he has a perfect defence, and will not be mulcted in penalties; but if you add these words, then the person who has the food on his premises with design may escape penalties by such a clause as this would be, with the Amendment of the hon. Member added, and justice will not reach him. I am quite sure that if you wish to make the Act deterrent you must be extremely severe in dealing with cases of possession of unsound food; and I hope the House will not agree to this Amendment, which I am sure would prejudice the course of justice.
 MR. F. S. POWELL : I would point out that the principle of this proposal has already been adopted in several local Acts. As to the experience of two years it is only in precise harmony with a clause passed in the Local Government Act of 1888.
(11.36.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : The proposed Amendment will leave the matter exactly where it is. It simply amounts to this: That an offence is to be punished with a penalty to which a man is not liable if he has not committed the offence. But it is a very different thing to say that when a man knows he is going to be prosecuted he shall be allowed to rush off, and, by giving notice, escape the infliction of a penalty.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I will inquire, but I doubt the practicability. I may say that the irrigation has been improved—not that there has been an increased area of cultivatable laud, but of land that can be profitably cultivated. The case is like that of Scinde, where the irrigation depends upon the rise of the waters of the Indus and the efficiency of the works for irrigation purposes. The area cultivated in any year depends upon the efficiency of the works, both for irrigation and protection from flood, and varies from year to year.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I shall be happy to show all the Papers we have upon the subject to the hon. Member.
 *SIR J. FERGUSSON : I am unable to answer that question.
 *THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E.) : The reply to the first question is in the affirmative; to the second in the negative. No reliable answer can be given to the third question without reference to Egypt, and the whole subject of irrigation is one that can be more properly considered and dealt with by the Egyptian Authorities in consultation with their technical advisers than in this country by Her Majesty's Government.
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : Is there any objection to having maps relating to this matter placed in the tea room?
 SIR W. LAWSON : Has Mr. Will-cocks presented any Reports upon the subject?
 SIR W. LAWSON : I believe there is absolutely no objection to the principle of the Bill; all the objection is to the details. [ Cries of
 SIR W. LAWSON : May I ask what course the Government propose to take with Order No. 10—Betting and Loans (Infants) Bill?
 SIR W. LAWSON : The Bill has come from the Lords, so that it has only to pass this House. It might be disposed of without unnecessary delay, and there would be an end of the matter.
 MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : Is it not usual to put a notice in the Library inviting Members who desire to attend to put down their names? I cannot find that in this case any such notice has been put up.
 MR. CREMER : Why not put up the usual notice?
 MR. CREMER : In many instances a demand has now for the first time been made upon householders of 20 and 30 years' standing, without being defaulters, for a quarter's rate in advance.
 MR. CREMER : I beg to ask the President of the Local Government Board whether he is aware that the New River Company are demanding from persons whom they supply with water a quarter's water rate in advance, and that this demand is made even upon persons who have regularly paid their rates for 20 or more years; if he can state the amount which is thus being added to the capital of the Company; and, if the action of the Company is strictly legal, whether the Government on the grounds of equity will consider the necessity of introducing a Bill or taking any other steps to compel any Water Company which exacts such advanced payments to pay to every person from whom they thus obtain deposits a fair rate of interest for the deposits which they are compelled to make?
 MR. CREMER : Is it contemplated by the Acts to which the right hon. Gentleman refers that householders of 20 and 30 years' standing, who have never been defaulters, should at the end of that time have a quarter's rate demanded in advance?
(11.5.)  MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : I cannot help thinking that the Amendment the Lords have adopted will practically destroy the character of the clause which was agreed to by the Committee upstairs, and also by the House on the Third Reading of the Bill. The object of that clause was to impose a penalty upon the real culprits; to protect the owner and occupier from being unjustly fined when they have been guilty of no offence. It frequently happens that owners and occupiers are held responsible for the insanitary condition of their dwellings when the real culprit is the builder or his workman. The owner and occupier may engage a man whom they regard as a respectable builder, and pay him a good sum of money for putting down drains or repairing closets, and yet the work may be imperfectly done and shamefully scamped. Blind drains may be put down, or pipes may be laid down with dry joints, with the consequence
 1202
 *SIR W. GUYER HUNTER  (Hackney, Central) : I must Say I am amazed at the speech of the hon. Gentleman who has just sat down, who has had the audacity to call members of the Council of the Sanitary Institute "amateurs and faddists." I would inform him that the Council of the Sanitary Institute is composed of some of the leading sanitarians of the country. When I mention the name of Sir Douglas Gallon as the Chairman of that Council, I think I say enough to show that this body, instead of being a body of faddists and amateurs, is one of the most eminent Sanitary Authorities in the world. To show how popular it is, I need only say that 307 candidates have applied in one year for the certificate of the Institute; and that 22 of the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis, and 54 of the provincial Sanitary Authorities, insist on their Inspectors having the certificate of the Institute. This is going on increasing every year. And I would call the attention of the hon. Member who preceded me to the fact that the Sanitary Authority of Camber-well, his own constituency, have decided that their Inspector shall hold the certificate of the Institute.
 SIR J. GORST : The Secretary of State has no official information on the subject, but the hon. Member's question will be communicated to the Government of India in the usual course.
 SIR J. GORST : The Secretary of State has been informed by the Government of India that the Gwalior Durbar has appointed a special Judge, who was shortly expected at Nijain, to try the case. The Government of India is watching the case.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether the final telegram to the Viceroy of India regarding the Factory Act, contained in Parliamentary Paper, No. 224, presented on 5th May, and ending "By decision of Her Majesty's Government Bill must be passed without delay," was sent by "the Secretary of State in Council," and after the Council had had due opportunity of expressing an opinion as provided by law?
 SIR J. GORST : The telegram was sent as urgent, under Section 26 of the 21st and 22nd Vic, cap. 106, and subsequently submitted to Council as therein prescribed.
 DR. McDONALD  (Ross and Cromarty) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General, with reference to the letter from the General Post Office, dated 30th December, 1889, to the Commissioners of Stornoway, which stated that the Strome-Stornoway mail steamer went to Portree for shelter only, and that the owner, Mr. Macbrayne, promised that
 "Under no circumstances, unless compelled by storm to do so, would the steamer be diverted from her course," 1252 Clydesdale
 MR. CRILLT  (Mayo, N.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General if the following positions in the Irish Post Office establishment are vacant at present, namely, a surveyor's clerkship in the Irish Southern District and a principal clerkship in the Accountant's Department; and, if so, how long have these appointments remained unfilled; whether it is intended to fill them; and what is the cause of the delay?
(4.34.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL  (Kirkcaldy,  : When we made the change in the procedure of this House, which enables all sorts of Indian subjects to be discussed before we come to the Indian Budget, I ventured to express doubt and dissent as to the expediency of the alteration. It seems to me that the proceedings of this evening are a justification of the doubts I then expressed. The Legislature has not contemplated that India should be administered in this House, but no doubt the finances of India are very closely connected "with the interests of this country, large sums of money being borrowed by India from this country. Therefore, Parliament in its wisdom thought fit that there should be an opportunity for this House to deal to some extent one evening in the Session with the finances of India. We have now departed from that arrangement. There is very little doubt that the finances of India will not be discussed at all this evening, and the result will be that the object of discussing those finances will be lost, and we shall be treated instead to a Debate on all sorts of subjects. I have rather prophesied that the subject of factory law reform in India would be a matter of close interest in this country. I am very ready to admit that the hon. Member for Flintshire (Mr. S. Smith) is not actuated by personal motives in this matter, as we all know him to be a man of wide philanthropy. At the same time, I must take exception to what he has said. I ask him where is the evidence of the abominations which he says have taken place in the Indian factories? No doubt some precautions are required for the fencing of machinery, and for providing that the health of the operatives is duly eared for. But as to children being
 1273
*(10.14.)  SIR ROPER LFTHBRIDGE  (Kensington, N.) : I desire to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for India on the very pucid and interesting explanation he has given to the Committee of the Memorandum which has been circulated to all the Members of this House. That Memorandum, Sir, is a very great convenience, and I hope that in future years it may be widely distributed through the medium of the Press. I would suggest that it might be circu-
 1340 1341 1342 1343 "In judging of the weight of taxation in India we must also take into account the vast benefits of our great public works. The railways' gross receipts are Rx.17,000,000, and the old modes of carriage would cost, at least, three times that, and the irrigation increases the produce by Rs.20 an acre, giving Rx.16,000,000 on 8,000,000 acres, together Rx.50,000,000, or, by these two things alone, a saving of more than the whole taxation, and this, beside all the multiplied benefits from other works, and by the Post Office, &c. delivering a letter at 2,000 miles distance for a penny, for instance. So that certainly, ii we had abolished all taxation, and not spent Rx.300,000,000 on public works, India would
 1344 "All that is now wanted is that the Indian Government should have an annual loan of Rx.5,000,000 or Rx.6,000,000, at, least, to cover all public works expenditure, and supply the place of the opium revenue, which it is clear now that England has determined to abolish."
 THE CHAIRMAN : Order, order! That is beyond the scope of the discussion allowable in this Committee.
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE COLONIES (Baron H. DE WORMS,  Liverpool, East Toxteth : In answer to the first part of the question,
 1248
 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Lord G. HAMILTON,  Middlesex, Ealing : These forts have been condemned as obsolete, and the dismounting of the smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns, with which they were armed, has practically left the defence of Lough Foyle where it was before. It is not considered necessary to maintain a coast defence ship in Lough Foyle.
 MR. PROVAND : Permit me to make a personal explanation. I have no interest whatever in mills. I have not sixpenny worth of interest in any Manchester manufacture. I have never been spoken to on the subject by anyone interested in Manchester manufactures. The only interest I have is a tripartite interest. I am interested in a limited company, formerly a private firm, which sells Indian spinnings in China, which sells large quantities of American cotton goods in China, and which also sells cotton goods in China. I have moved in this matter for no reason whatever except that I believe the accounts that have come from India respecting the barbarities perpetrated in factories there—
 MR. PROVAND : Having some Manchester business is very different from owning cotton mills.
(3.0.)  MR. PROVAND  (Glasgow, Blackfriars) : Mr. Speaker, as this is the only opportunity I shall have, I desire to bring before the House some matters relating to the employment of labour in Indian mills and factories in conformity with the notice which I have had on the Paper for some time past, to the effect that further reforms are necessary in the Law of India dealing with native labour in factories and workshops. Even before the recent Labour Conference held at Berlin labour questions had come to receive more attention, not only in this country but throughout Europe generally, and we have recently ourselves been engaged in discussing a new Factory Act, chiefly made up of amendments to the principal Act of 1878, and a principal object of the new Act is to alter the age at which children may begin to work and the hours of labour for women, and to introduce remedial clauses for their benefit. India, too, has had its Factory Acts, and there has been one recently passed which is to take effect on the 1st day of next January, and one of the main objects I have in bringing forward this question is to draw attention to the inadequate character of this Act to meet the reasonable requirements for the control and regulation of native labour in India. The present position of labour in that country is that it has almost no protection whatever, except in the case of children. Any person above 12 years of age may be worked at any hour night or day, and for as many hours as employers think proper; the sole exception is that children between 7 and 12 years of age cannot be worked in mills more than nine hours a day. It is to remedy this and other conditions that the recent Act has been passed, but its provisions are so inadequate, and the Act deals with such a small percentage of Indian labour, that I have no doubt the House will agree with me in considering
 1260 1261 "Operatives who had been answering our questions freely while alone, were in many instances reduced to silence or evasive replies by the accidental presence of their employers." 1262 "The general principle of all factory legislation, as already adopted in this country and in India, is that life and limb must be protected, and that the health of all women, young persons, and children must, so far as possible, be assured. To this principle Her Majesty's Government have recently, in the Berlin Conference, declared their adhesion, thus recommending it for adoption by the other Powers of Europe. How far this general principle has been already applied in India is a matter for your consideration. As regards any additional factory legislation in India, due regard must be had to the circumstances of that country, which are in many respects different from those of an European nation. But the same general principle is, nevertheless, applicable, and the object of any such legislation must be to secure without fail for the various classes of operatives in India an amount of protection for life and limb, and an amount of security for the health of women, young persons, and children not inferior to that which is afforded by the law of England." 1263 "There is no process by which the Inspector can detect that women are being overworked, as there is nothing to show when they commenced, when they left off, and when they took their meals." employés "Without fail for the various classes of operatives in India an amount of protection for life and limb, and an amount of security for the health of women, young persons, and children, not inferior to that which is afforded by the law of England." "A Hindoo girl of 15 is about equal to an English girl of 11, instead of the reverse, and that statements to the contrary by Englishmen who have no opportunity of being acquainted with family life were totally misleading." 1264 Times "Any readers who will take the trouble to go back to the evidence which was adduced by Lord Shaftesbury in support of the reforms which are inseparably associated with his name will find that opposition to the Factory Acts in England proceeded on precisely the same lines as those on which it is now being conducted in India." 1265 "It would be an absolute disgrace to this country, the acknowledged pioneer of factory legislation in Europe, if Indian manufacturers were still suffered to practise the barbarities from which our Representatives at the Conference fancied themselves able to denounce from a position of unusual security." "We can pledge ourselves for Great Britain that our Government, faithful to its actions in the past, will conform resolutely in the future, if it does not go beyond them, to the benevolent principles of the Conference." employés employés 1266 Times "He will not permit to exist in India a state of things which would be an absolute disgrace to this country—the acknowledged pioneer of factory legislation in Europe."
 MR. PROVAND : I said to China. Ascertain your facts.
 MR. SPEAKER : Order, order! The hon. Gentleman has already spoken on the Main Question.
 MR. SPEAKER : It is a well-established rule. The hon. Member is quite out of order in speaking again on the Main Question. The hon. Gentleman spoke, and I was surprised at his intervening, knowing that he had a Motion on the Paper; but there is no rule for his speaking again.
 MR. SPEAKER : It is not the question of the public railways of India which is now before the House, but only the North-West extension.
 MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 MR. SPEAKER : Order, order!
 MR. SPEAKER : I must remind the noble Lord that the Question before the House is that the Lords Amendment be considered forthwith.
 MR. SPEAKER : The noble Lord is committing an irregularity in point of form. The only Question before the House is this particular Amendment.
 MR. MADDEN : The general views of the Government on this question may be gathered from the statements made in this House by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary for Ireland. He was at one time in hope that he might be able to prepare and lay before the House a measure dealing with this question during the present Session. Owing, however, to the short time available for this purpose and the importance of the subject, it has not been found possible to complete the measure now in course of
 1256
 MR. MADDEN : This question appears on the Paper for the first time to-day. I will bring the matter under the notice of the Local Government Board.
 MR. MADDEN : This question only appeared on the Paper this morning, and I have not been able to obtain official information. I hope to receive it tomorrow.
 MR. MADDEN : A Memorial in favour of the construction of a light railway between Listowel and Tarbert was submitted locally to the Lord Lieutenant, and a resolution in favour of the same project has been passed by the Listowel Board of Guardians; but so far no definite scheme has been brought under the notice of the Government.
 MR. MADDEN : A Report has been called for since the question appeared on the Paper, but I have not yet received a Report.
 MR. MADDEN : The Fishery Inspectors say that it is the case that the offence referred to in the question was reported to have occurred in Brandon Bay, and they are engaged in making the necessary inquiries.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University : I am informed by the Local Government Board that the Local Government Inspectors have already called attention to the unfitness of this building.
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that Mr. Miller, one of the Inspectors appointed by the Land Commission, refused to pass 50 tons of potatoes delivered by Mr. Thomas Ryan, in accordance with a tender approved by other such Inspectors, at Cavan for the use of the Cavan Union, and that, on the Guardians refusing, as they were bound by "The Seed Potatoes (Ireland) Act, 1891," to do, to accept these potatoes, Mr. Ryan brought an action against the Guardians, and recovered damages and costs, the jury refusing to accept Mr. Miller's Re port; and whether, as the Land Commission prevented the Guardians from sending two experienced members of their body to Scotland to select potatoes, and compelled them to buy by tender and sample, and to act in accordance with the orders of the Inspectors, the damages and costs will be paid by the Land Commission or the Local Government Board, through the action of whose agents they were incurred?
 MR. KNOX : I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury why the Report of the Committee appointed by the Lord Lieutenant to inquire into the Lunacy Administration in Ireland was printed in Scotland; and whether any Reports relating to England or Scotland have ever been printed in Ireland?
 MR. E. ROBERTSON : The Bill has absolutely nothing to do with betting by infants, and I give notice that if the Chancellor of the Exchequer repeats tonight the tactics which he has hitherto pursued I shall take the opportunity on the Third Reading of the Appropriation Bill of calling attention to the unjust, partial, and oppressive way in which the right hon. Gentleman has used the facilities given him for Government Business.
 MR. E. ROBERTSON  (Dundee) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he will to-night move the Adjournment of the House at the conclusion of Government Business instead of waiting, as he did this morning, for certain private Members' Orders to be called on?
 MR. BYRNE  (Wicklow, W.) : I beg to ask the Postmaster General whether he has ordered the mail car now plying between Tinahely, Hacketstown, and Kiltegan, to be withdrawn; is this car to be run from Baltinglass to Kiltegan and Hacketstown instead; will this arrangement cause the Tinahely letters to Hacketstown and Kiltegan to be sent  viâ
(5.58.)  MR. G. N. CURZON  (Lancashire, Southport) : Both the Ameer of Afghanistan and the Indian Government stand in a position of very great delicacy. The Ameer is, undoubtedly, a remarkable man—of haughty, imperious, and truculent character, and very jealous indeed of
 1294 1295 1296
 MR. CURZON : The tribes of which I spoke are not, and have not for years been, subject to the Ameer of Afghanistan. The fact is, the majority of them are not Afghans in sympathy, and, at the present moment, the Ameer has no more power over these tribes than the hon. Member himself has.
 MR. GOSCHEN : If the hon. Member think it necessary that infants should continue to bet for the next six months, I am afraid he must take the ordinary steps to prevent the Bill from passing. The Government wish to pass the Bill, and will endeavour to do so.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's Hanover Square : No, Sir; for my own part I am not prepared to adopt the course suggested by the hon. Member.
 MR. GOSCHEN : It is to be understood that no other business will be taken at the Morning Sitting except the Third Reading of the Appropriation Bill.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square : It may be for the convenience of the House that I should move that the House do meet at Ten o'clock to-morrow. By meeting at that hour it will be possible to have the Prorogation to-morrow afternoon.
 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade in what position the negotiations with Foreign Governments with reference to the adoption of the universal load line now stand; and whether he will press on these negotiations?
 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that a convict at Chatham has been whipped for not working, then taken to the hospital to be made ready to be whipped again, put out in the frost in the winter between three casks because he would not work, and punished again and again; and whether he will allow a Visiting Justice of 27 years' standing to visit the prison in which this man is, to see if he is badly treated, as reported, or not?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India what is the nature of the services of Messrs. Cook and Sons, referred to by him in an after dinner speech a few days ago, when he said—
 "The nation was not fully aware of the debt of gratitude which was owed to Messrs.
 1246
*(8.5.)  COLONEL BLUNDELL  (Lancashire, S.W., Ince) : I think there must be something in this case that has not been communicated to the House. Colonel Jackson appears to have been selected for the purpose of restoring efficiency to an inefficient regiment, and in that task he seems to have failed. I contend that, while it is perfectly right to remove him from the regiment on such a ground, it does not appear to be a sufficient cause for turning out of the Army an officer who was actually chosen for this very difficult duty on account of his supposed efficiency. While I deprecate making the House a Court of Appeal in such matters, I would still urge upon the Secretary of State that the case appears to require further investigation before a final determination is come to.
 MR. COBB  (Warwick, S.E., Rugby) : I beg to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he will, during the Recess, communicate with Ministers at the head of the different Departments with a view of issuing orders removing all exceptional restrictions upon the political action of Government officials, so that, out of official hours, they may enjoy the same rights as other citizens?
 *MR. H. H. FOWLER  (Wolverhampton, E.) : I do not object to this Amendment. The House will observe that the clause from which we dissented, and which the House of Lords do not insist upon, is replaced by an entirely new clause, and which, while it carries out the principle of grouping so much desired by the noble Lord opposite (Lord Cranborne), nevertheless completely prevents any result which would involve an increase of the Parliamentary grant to any school whatever. It is not for me to express an opinion as to whether the grouping, deprived of pecuniary temptations, will be extensively carried out; but, so far as this
 1362
(12.5.)  MR. H. H. FOWLER : I suppose it is understood that no business will be taken to-morrow other than the Third Reading of the Appropriation Bill?
 MR. MATTHEWS : I have made inquiry of the prison authorities, who inform me that they presume the prisoner referred to is one Joseph Betts, who since his conviction more than two years ago has persistently refused to do any labour whatever, and for this reason has received various punishments, including corporal punishment. The allegations that he was taken to the hospital to be made ready for whipping again and put out in the frost because he would not work are unfounded. He has been taken out to work in the winter with other prisoners, but has refused to work as they did, and had, therefore, to be restrained by handcuffs and otherwise until the party returned to prison. There are Visitors appointed for Chatham Prison, who have free access to all the prisoners, who can enter the prison at any time, and who make periodical visits for the express purpose of ascertaining, among other things, whether prisoners have been improperly treated. I am aware of no sufficient reason which would justify me in superseding the Visitors and authorising a special visit to which neither a Justice of the Peace nor the Visiting Justice of a local prison is entitled by the rules.
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. MATTHEWS,  Birmingham, E. : The facts are as stated in the first two paragraphs of the question. I am informed that the Lunacy Commissioners, who have themselves no power to discharge, pointed out to the asylum authorities the informality of the certificate, and recommended the patient's discharge. This recommendation was given with a view that the woman when discharged should be immediately re-certified in the ordinary course, and it was so understood by the asylum authorities. Accordingly, the woman was discharged to the workhouse, and was there examined by the medical officer, the person, as it happened, on whose certificate she had, on September 19, been sent to the asylum. He, however, examining her again on October 8, declined to certify that she was then of unsound mind, and accordingly she went home. There she remained with her husband and children until the end of June following, when the crime was committed. There appears no ground for attaching blame to any of the authorities concerned, and I regret that all the facts were not brought before the learned Judge.
 MR. MATTHEWS : I will willingly do so if the hon. Member wishes it. This has been a very troublesome prisoner in every prison in which he has been confined.
 MR. MATTHEWS : Corporal punishment is only administered after inquiry upon oath, and by order of the Directors of the prison.
 MR. MATTHEWS : No, Sir; they have not. The Visitors of the prison are the County Court Judge and two of the local Magistrates.
 *MR. RAIKES : Both of the appointments to which the hon. Member refers have been vacant for some months. Suggestions have been made with a view to a re-adjustment of the duties, and until these suggestions have been more fully considered I am not prepared to state whether the appointments in question will be filled.
 *THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (Mr. RAIKES,  Cambridge University : By an arrangement concluded in the spring of this year the contractor for the Strome Ferry and Stornoway Mail Packet is allowed, in the event of accident—storm, or other like circumstance of special and exceptional character preventing the despatch in due course of the Strome Ferry Portree steamer—to divert the former steamer from the direct course so as to admit of its touching at certain ports in Skye. I am not aware of any case in which, without permission obtained, this privilege has been improperly exercised. I have no exact information as to the age of the  Clydesdale Clydesdale
 *MR. RAIKES : I shall be glad to make inquiry into the matter to which the hon. Member refers, and I will let him know the result in due course.
 *MR. RAIKES : I do not know that I can add much to the answer which I gave last week on this subject to the hon. Member for North Longford, and in which I fully explained the reasons for the proposed change. I am afraid that circumstances would nod warrant the employment of two cars, as suggested by the hon. Member; but I will with pleasure make inquiries on this point, and acquaint him with the result.
 MR. MACLEAN  (Oldham) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the case of Mary Braithwaite, who, on account of some informality in the certificate on which she had been sent to Wadsley Lunatic Asylum, was discharged there from, and was not re-certified, and who afterwards while at large committed the murder for which she was tried before Mr. Justice Grantham at the recent Leeds Assizes; whether the jury found that she was guilty of the crime, but insane at the time she committed it; and whether any blame attaches to the authorities concerned in the case?
 *MR. MACLEAN : I beg my right hon. Friend's pardon. I did not mean to
 1300
 *MR. MACLEAN (resuming) : I will now proceed, Mr. Speaker, to make some observations on a very important question really affecting the financial position of India. My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy said he hoped this night would not be wasted in discussing all sorts of extraneous questions, so that no question really affecting the finances of India could be brought before the House. I wish to call attention to a very important matter really affecting the finances of India. I would point out,
 1279 1280 1281 1282 1283 Il faut de l'audace, encore de l'audace, et toujours de l'audace 1284 1285 Greater Britain 1286 en route 1287
*(4.50.)  MR. MACLEAN  (Oldham) : I had not intended, Mr. Speaker, to make any remarks on this subject, because on other occasions I have spoken sufficiently about it already. But the flattering references made by hon. Members opposite to the part I have taken in the discussion of the question make me desire to say a word or two. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Sir G. Campbell) has suggested that I have been playing something of a dual character with regard to this question—that I took one view in respect to India and a different view in regard to Lancashire. Now, I have never pretended to have taken up this question of factory labour as a philanthropist. On the contrary, I have invariably advocated the restriction of the excessive hours of labour that factory operatives in India have to work on the ground that it was unfair that the operatives of this country should be exposed to competition of that kind. It is quite true that I pressed the Secretary of State and the Under Secretary of State to take action in this matter—not on my own account so much as that I represented a large body of employers and factory operatives who had brought this matter in successive years to the notice of the Secretary of State. And I certainly thought that as a certain standard
 1277 1278
 MR. MAGUIRE  (Donegal, N) : I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as Greencastle and Magilligan Forts have been dismantled, he would send a stationary man-of-war to remain in Lough Foyle for the protection of the district?
 MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether he is aware that, with the exception of a preliminary inquiry, nothing had been done when the last mail left India to bring to justice the persons who murdered Bulwrunt Rao, at Nijain, in the Gwalior territory on 19th May last; and whether the Government of India are taking steps to secure that these persons are speedily put upon their trial, and that full inquiry is made as to
 1247
 *MR. SEYMOUR KEAY : I am all the more glad, then, to hear that the hon. Baronet's conversion is not new. At the same time, I cannot help recognising in him the same official optimist whom we always expect to find representing the
 1352 1353 Apropos 1354 1355 1356 1357 1358 1359 1360
 *MR. SEYMOUR KEAY : I congratulate the hon. Baronet opposite (Sir R. Temple) on one distinct advance which he has made, inasmuch as he has just told us that he has joined the ranks of those who consider that the elective principle should be extended in some degree to India.
(8.9.)  MR. KEAY  (Elgin and Nairn) : I have on the Paper a Notice of Motion in favour of giving the people of India a voice in the raising and administering of their own revenues; but, in view of the enormous importance of the questions which are raised by it, I think it is impossible that the subject can be adequately discussed at this time, and in order to suit the convenience of the House I shall defer my remarks to a future occasion.
 MR. STACK  (Kerry, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he has yet obtained information as to the extent of the farm at Drumroe, Causeway, County Kerry, sold through the Land Commission by Mr. Hussey to Bartholomew

 MR. STACK : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland what is the present position of the matter with regard to the proposed construction of a light railway from Listowel to Tarbert, in County Kerry; and what steps the Government propose to take in respect of it?
 *SIR M. HICKS BEACH : In August, 1890, the Foreign Office, at the request of the Board of Trade, called the attention of the Governments of all maritime countries to the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Load Line) Act, 1890, but no final replies have yet been received.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Sir M. HICKS BEACH,  Bristol, W. : I am informed that the Boards of Conservators in England and Wales complain generally of difficulties which they experience in the erection of gratings at mills under the provisions of the Salmon Fishery Acts, in consequence of the absence of a means of determining beforehand the differences which frequently arise between themselves and the occupiers of mills on the subject, and that, in many cases, they abstain from erecting gratings from fear of the expensive litigation which might ensue, their funds being in most cases limited. In the event of a decision being sought on the point whether a grating which had been erected was injurious to the milling power, it might be obtained by the occupier of the mill under the 54th

 *MR. S. SMITH : May I rise to order, Sir? I have a notice on the Paper which comes next.
 *MR. S. SMITH : But may I submit, as a point of order, that I simply rose to make an explanation in reference to an allusion which the hon. Member for Edinburgh made to a question of mine? I merely rose under the belief that I was quite in order in alluding to it, and that it would not debar me from bringing on the Motion standing in my name.
*(4.29.)  MR. S. SMITH  (Flintshire) : I do not intend to say much upon this occasion, as I have a Motion down in my own name, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Buchanan) has referred to a question which was put by me last year, it is only right that I should offer an explanation. My hon. Friend only read a portion of my question. What I spoke of was the competition between the Lancashire operatives and those in India who were working for 80 hours a week. I can only say that to some extent I share the feeling of my hon. Friend, and that I fully appreciate the great danger of imposing severe restrictions upon Indian factory labour. It is quite true that I felt that the time had come when we should have some kind of factory legislation in India. Children of seven years old had been reduced to skeletons by the cruel conditions under which they had to work, and I felt it was disgraceful to see a Christian nation standing still and not moving a single muscle to abate abominations which went on in India, and which we stopped in this country 50 years ago. I am not afraid, or ashamed to say, in face of the native population of India, for whom I have always pleaded in this House, that the manufacturers of India are not only native Indians, but largely Lancashire capitalists, and that the Indian factories work to a large extent with Lancashire capital. These slave drivers in India are not only wealthy Indians, but are sometimes wealthy Englishmen. I say that on the ground of justice and humanity legislation of this kind is absolutely called for. I do not believe such legislation will do the slightest harm to trade in India even more than it did in Lancashire. The same arguments are used against it now as were used against it formerly in India. However, I quite believe that it would never do for this country to force upon India legislation which would have the appearance of being suggested by jealousy of her national manufactures.

*(9.23.)  MR. S. SMITH : I think the Committee must have listened with much interest to the statement just made, and more especially to the last part containing very important intelligence with respect to the agricultural prospects in India. It will certainly be a great relief to the House and the country to know that the great disaster which threatened India a short time ago has, by the providence of God, passed away for the present. Of the statement just made I may say it was of a somewhat optimistic character, and I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee on the fact that for the last two years there has been a considerable surplus in India. But I must express my great dissatisfaction with the
 1330 1331 "There are millions of men and women and children who have their lives shortened, their physique stunted, their moral and intellectual faculties blunted by lack of cheap salt." 1332 1333 "After the most careful review of all these considerations, Her Majesty's Government are of opinion that the advantages which may reasonably be expected to accrue, not only to those immediately connected with the land, but to the community generally, are sufficiently great to justify them in incurring the risk of some prospective loss of revenue in order to attain them, and that a settlement in perpetuity, in which the conditions required are, or may hereafter be, fulfilled, is a measure dictated by sound policy and calculated to accelerate the development of the resources of India, and to ensure in the highest degree the welfare and contentment of all classes of Her Majesty's subjects in the country." 1334 1335 bonâ fide 1336 1337 "The best conclusion I can form is that the permanent cost of the Army is likely to increase, but though it is impossible to fix any limit, we may hope the increase will not be very great at least for a time." 1338 1339
(10.33.)  MR. BUCHANAN  (Edinburgh, W.) : I propose only to touch upon one point, and that is the increase of military expenditure in India. That was alluded to by the right hon. Gentleman himself in his Explanatory Statement, in which he pointed out that the Expenditure for 1891–92 is exceedingly high. Sir David Barbour has pointed out that the increase of Expenditure in India of late years has entailed, from broad results, an increase of the Salt Duty, the imposition of a duty on petroleum, the absorption of the Famine Fund, and the appropriation of certain revenue at the disposal of the local Governments. The Under Secretary of State has pointed out that the increase of military expenditure is due principally to the special defence works and cost of ordnance stores. These two increases of expenditure are, I take it, directly due to the connection of the Government of India with the Home Government; they are owing to the association of the Indian military administration with the Home Army. That subject was brought forward in the early part of the Session with regard to one particular point connected with the administration of the Army of India, and we then got an assurance

 MR. SEXTON  (Belfast, W.) : We have not yet received copies of the Returns in reference to the financial relations between this country and Ireland which were promised some time ago. I presume they will be shortly in hand.
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether representations have been made to him that the law relating to the enforcement of gratings on mills in England, to prevent salmon entering the watercourses of mills, has been proved to be ineffective for the purpose; and, if so, is it on account of the deficiency or want of funds on the part of Boards of Conservators to erect such gratings, or whether the English Board have sufficient funds to erect and maintain them; whether millowners in England have offered any opposition to put up such gratings on streams frequented by salmon; what is the general nature or character of the working power of the mills in England, that is, whether worked by bucket wheels or turbines; where gratings have been put, what has been their character, at whose expense have they been erected, and in what places, or at what mills in England; have they been proved injurious to the effective working power of the mill; if any complaint that they would, or do, who decides the matter; is there any appeal; and, if so, to what Court; and have any complaints been made by any Boards of Conservators, or any other persons interested, against the insufficiency of the present laws in England bearing on this subject; and, if so, what is the nature of the complaints or the reasons given by them that the law is insufficient or ineffective?
 MR. T. M. HEALY : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he is aware that a steamer has been lately trawling in Brandon Bay, County Kerry, contrary to a bye-law made many years ago prohibiting trawling in this bay; and, if so, what steps will be taken to prosecute the owners or master of this vessel; and if there is any coastguard or other authority near this bay to prevent infractions of the law; and, if not, what steps will be taken to enforce the observance of the law, and protect the fishermen from such conduct?
 MR. T. M. HEALY  (Longford, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland what action the Local Government Board intend to take with regard to the complaints as to the condition of the dispensary at Burt, County Donegal; and will they sanction four dispensaries in one district?
 GENERAL GOLDSWORTHY  (Hammersmith) : I think it necessary to point out that the punishment meted out to Colonel Jackson is of a character which might justify a little further inquiry into this matter. Colonel Jackson has not only been removed from the command of this particular cavalry regiment, but from the Indian Military Service. I think that some consideration should be given to his case in order that we may ascertain whether, in view of the former good service of that officer, and the high character he has always maintained, some means may not be found for retaining his services. I appeal, therefore, to the Under Secretary to withhold the final decision in regard to Colonel Jackson's case until some further consideration can be given to it.
 MR. W. M'LAREN  (Cheshire, Crewe) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India, with regard to the fact that the Government of India licenses three shops for the retail sale of opium at the penal settlement of Port Blair, whether he will make inquiry as to the allegation that, although the sale of opium to convicts is prohibited, such sale, in fact, takes place to a large extent, and that a considerable proportion of the gratuity money given to convicts is, in fact, repaid to Government by the purchase of opium; and whether he will represent to the Government of India the advisability of at once closing the shops, and prohibiting the sale of opium altogether in a settlement of which the population is mainly composed of convicts.
 *THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : The question has not come before me. The only reason I can conjecture is that the course pursued was found most convenient.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N. : Yes; they have been laid on the Table.
 MR. W. A. MACDONALD  (Queen's Co., Ossory) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he can state to the House his reason for departing from the intention he expressed of introducing this Session a Bill dealing with the question of free education in Ireland? I have to protest against the alteration of this question, and also that it appears in the name of a former Member who is dead.
 MR. WOODALL : Will the right hon. Gentleman make special inquiry into the case?
 MR. WOODALL  (Hanley) : Have the Prison Visitors made any special Report with regard to this particular prison?
 *MR. MORTON : Of course, Sir, I bow to your ruling. I suppose I shall be in order in referring to matters of finance. One is as to the request which has been made for the reduction of the Salt Duty. So far as I can understand that tax, it appears to me to be very similar to what the Corn Duty was in this country, and it is being treated as that duty was treated 50 or 60 years ago. The general opinion of those who understand Indian affairs is, that this Salt Duty should be greatly reduced. I think that would be only wise and fair to the Indian people, and I hope the Government will soon adopt that policy. I am in favour of the Income Tax minimum being raised from Rs.500 to Rs.1,000. It is, in my opinion, most unjust that £20,000,000 a year should be spent in India for military purposes, while only £1,000,000 is spent for educational purposes. I hope that soon the Government will see its way to give the people of India more extended powers of Local Government, and I trust, too, that next year the Indian Budget will be discussed at an earlier period of the Session. I am very sorry the people of India have lost a good friend in the person of the late Charles Bradlaugh,

*(10.44.)  MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I regret that the hon. Member for Flintshire did not have the opportunity of bringing forward his Motion to-day, dealing as it does with matters which were before the Indian Congress last year. We are now fortunately better able to understand Indian affairs than we were, because for six years the Indian people have held Congresses. It may be claimed that we on this side the House represent the Indian people here, while hon. Members opposite represent the official classes, to whom are paid the millions of which we have heard so much. I gather from the excellent Report of the last Congress—
*(7.30.)  GENERAL FITZWYGRAM  (Hants, S.) : I have only a few words to offer in reference to this subject, the facts with regard to which are exceedingly simple. Colonel Jackson was in his younger days a man of some distinction, but, at the

 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I never said my hon. Friend had some mills, but I said he had some cotton interest. He tells us that he has such an interest, and that he does export Lancashire manufactures for sale in India.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I must apologise to my hon. Friend. I always thought that he had some Manchester business—
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I thought he said to India. Well, Sir, I will not be personal to my hon. Friend, but I will say that it is Lancashire cotton people who press on the Government the necessity of restraining the manufactures
 1274 A cry of 1275 Life of Sir Thomas Munro 1276
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : Well, we will not dispute about words. It is true they are not subject to the Ameer of Afghanistan, but the Ameer rules over the larger number of Afghans, and those tribes from the Black Mountain and far below are of the purest Afghan type. It is said that we are now attempting to establish relations with those tribes by voluntary and pacific means. A curious commentary is afforded on that statement by what is now taking place in that country. Does the hon. Member call the Black Mountain Expedition and other military expeditions voluntary and pacific agencies by means of which the tribes may be brought under our control? What I complain of is rather that we are advancing by military means, and endeavouring to bring these Afghan tribes under our control by force of arms. The Afghans are a very independent race. If you attempt to bring them under control by force you may make them rise, and will
 1297 1298
(5.15.)  SIR G. CAMPBELL : In the former part of the speech of the Member for Oldham I felt that I agreed with him, but when the hon. Member for South-port came to speak of the new Indian frontier, I felt I must differ from him. He tells us there are tribes there "who, are not Afghans at all. I venture to tell him that in every sense of the word they are the purest Afghans. In fact, the greater part of the real and true Afghans, in language and character, are those tribes that lie between our frontier and the frontier of the Ameer of Afghanistan.
 SIR G. CAMPBELL : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies if he can say whether the news from Natal, published in a Reuter's telegram, is authentic in so far as it states that the Legislative Council have passed a resolution pressing to get the period of indentures of Indian immigrants extended to 10 years, at the expiration of which they are to return to India, thereby subjecting Indians to compulsory labour for the whole period of their residence, and also that, after being dealt with by a special Committee, an amended Constitution Bill has been presented, by which the Colonists still insist that the Governor shall only exercise his powers over the Natives by advice of the Executive Council, and that the annual Vote for the Natives shall be subject to the control of the Council?
 SIR H. HAVELOCK-ALLAN  (Durham, S.E.) : It is with the very
 1303 1304 aide-de-camp aide-de-camp quasi 1305 "The Major General is, on the whole, satisfied that progress is being made in the drill and efficiency of the 5th Bengal Cavalry. It will give the Major General much pleasure to make a satisfactory Report of the state of the regiment." "At his recent inspection of the 5th Bengal Cavalry the Major General was satisfied generally with the interior economy and drill
 1306 1307 1308 1309 1310 "The noble Lord (Viscount Cross) had stated that one of the reasons why the Commander-in-Chief in India thought that this officer should not be allowed to return to his regiment was that he himself (the Commander-in-Chief) had on two occasions seen his regiment, once at Delhi and once at Lucknow, and that he had formed an unfavourable opinion on it." 1311
(8.4.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir J. FERGUSSON,  Manchester, N.E. : It ought to be borne in mind what is involved in the suggestions which have been made. No one likes to be hard on an officer who has done good service, and has won the respect and friendship of those with whom he has served. But those who are responsible have to consider the efficiency of the Army, and justice to other officers and to the public. Colonel Jackson has been removed from an appointment for which he was deemed unfit, and it is suggested that he should be retained in the Service for six years, until he is entitled to a retiring allowance of £1,100 a year. Now, that provision is intended for officers who have discharged their duties satisfactorily, and to say that a man shall be entitled to earn that allowance by nominal duty seems to be trifling with the interests of the Army, and with the public interests, as well as doing an injustice to officers who have performed their duties satisfactorily.
 *SIR J. GORST : I cannot answer that question without notice.
*(8.35.)  SIR J. GORST , rising at a quarter to Nine o'clock, at which time there were only three Members in the House, said: As I have had the advantage of issuing a Memorandum which those hon. Members interested in the subject have, no doubt, seen, the remarks I shall make will be as brief as possible. As the Committee is aware, there are three years which come under review—the year ending on the 31st March, 1890, the year ending on the 31st March, 1891, and the year ending on the 31st March, 1892. In regard to the first of these years, I have nothing whatever to add to the observations I have made in my Memorandum; it is the year which is alone technically before the Committee. All I have to say as to the year ending on the 31st March, 1890, I said in August last year. The surplus which was then predicted has been practically realised, and the variations in the revenue and expenditure as then estimated have been so infinitesimal that they are not worth troubling the Committee about. The most remarkable feature in connection with the year ending on the 31st March, 1891, is the great and extraordinary growth of the surplus every time it comes under review. At the time the Budget Estimate was made—in March
 1321 1322 1323 1324 1325 1326 1327 1328 "Agricultural prospects. Present position as follows:— Madras.—No change of any importance since my telegram of July 28 last. Prospects critical in parts of five districts; prices rising slowly; present monsoon is turning to continuous light rain. Relief measures sufficient. No grounds for apprehension of widespread distress. Bombay.—Good general rainfall, except in parts of Deccan, where sowing operations suspended. Prices stationary. Bengal.—Good rain has fallen throughout the province. Prospects of autumn crops good; winder rice crops backward. Prospects improving in Orissa, where there has been deficient rainfall. North-West Provinces and Oudh.—Good rain has fallen throughout the province. Prospects greatly improved. Agricultural operations generally progressing satisfactorily. Prices fluctuating. 1329 Punjab.—Good rain has fallen throughout the province. Dry lands in need of more rain for sowing operations. Prices fluctuating. Central Provinces—Assam, Coorg, Lower Burma.—Prospects continue favourable. Berar, Hyderabad.—Cotton in good condition. Agricultural operations generally progressing satisfactorily. Parts in need of more rain. Mysore.—General prospects continue good. Parts in need of more rain. Central India, Rajpootana.—Prospects greatly improved, except Bikanir. Agricultural operations generally progressing favourably. Improvement in fodder. Upper Burma.—Prospects continue favourable. Young crops sufferiug for want of rain. Prices not higher."
 *SIR J. GORST : I think it is a matter of regret that the time of the House should be taken up by the discussion of the grievances of an individual officer. We have been asked what were the qualifications of Colonel Jackson, and the hon. and gallant Gentleman who has just sat down is well qualified to express an opinion on that point; but inasmuch as this matter has been brought forward, it is necessary that I should offer a few words in reply. No one pretends to say that the old East India Company retained an officer in its service if his military superior pronounced him to be unfit. I venture to say that Sir Frederick Roberts is a far better judge as to the fitness or unfitness of a man to retain the command of his regiment than any of us can be, and Sir Frederick Roberts arrived at the conclusion that Colonel Jackson was not fit for the command of his regiment. I do not say whether this conclusion was right or wrong. It was a matter which came entirely within the province of General Sir Frederick Roberts as Commander-in-Chief, and the decision which he gave is one that cannot be impugned, unless we impute something in the nature of corrupt motives. The hon. Member shakes his head, but I submit again that General Roberts is a far better judge than this House. The House of Commons is not a competent tribunal to overrule the Commander-in-Chief in such a matter. General Luck reported that—
 "Colonel Jackson has had an opportunity, which few men get, of bringing an inefficient regiment into a state of efficiency. This, after six months, he has failed to do. I recommend his removal from the command at the end of
 1317 "This is a very unsatisfactory Report, and I regret to observe the small progress that has been made."
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham : The service alluded to was the conveyance of Indian pilgrims to Jeddah by Messrs. Cook, which has materially improved the conditions under which the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina is made. There is a small sum guaranteed by the Government of India in case of loss—£2,000 for the first year, and £1,000 subsequently. The full sum was claimed in 1887 and 1888, but only a small part in 1889 and 1890.
(6.28.)  THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham : I should be sorry to attempt to act as arbitrator between two such authorities as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and the hon. Member for Southport on the question of the ethnology of the tribes on the North-West Frontier of India. The hon. Member or Kirkcaldy is wrong, however, when he speaks of the policy pursued by the Government of India towards the Afghan tribes. The policy of the Government of India is not to interfere with the independence of those tribes, not to attempt any territorial aggression, not to attempt an extension of the frontier of India further than it is at present, but to bring the independent tribes, with full respect for their independence, into friendly relations with the British Empire, so that they might become guards and protectors of our frontier. It is quite true that, in pursuance of a policy of this kind, occasional outbreaks on the frontier will take place. In the course of last year there were outbreaks of that kind in the Black Mountain, to which the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy has alluded. But these are the necessary and natural incidents which happen in the pursuit of our policy. [Sir G. CAMPBELL: Hear, hear!] Well, the hon. Member utters an ironical "Hear, hear!" but you cannot carry on a policy on a great frontier like that, with a number of independent, half-civilised tribes, without occasional outbreaks and occasional differences; but the policy which is pursued is a policy not of war but of peace. These frontier wars are the failures, the occasional failures, of
 1299
 SIR J. GORST : I am glad that the hon. Member has made that disclaimer, because I am afraid that the language of the Resolution is equivocal; and I should be very sorry that it should be given out to the world at large that any Party or section in this House thought that these relations were of an unsatisfactory character. Now, whatever complaint other persons may have a right to make against the Ameer of Cabul, the British Government has none. He has kept faith with us, and as far as his stipulations in the relations which have existed between us go, he has been perfectly true to his engagements. I was rather sorry to hear in the admirable speech which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southport, with almost every word of which I agreed, that he should have thought it necessary to attack the Ameer's fiscal policy, for the House has nothing whatever to do with that policy The Ameer is not a vassal of the Queen Empress. The Ameer has always been recognised by the Queen-Empress as an independent ally, whom we protect and whom we assist, but over whom, and over whose territory, we have no right to exercise any jurisdiction whatever. It is quite true that he is subsidised by the Government of India. Why is he so subsidised? In order that he may be militarily strong. The object of the money which is given to him is that his military strength should be kept up, and I believe that the funds which he receives from the Indian Exchequer are applied to the purpose for which they are given. Then we have no right whatever to interfere with his fiscal policy. The fiscal policy which he pursues may, from the enlightened Western ideas of political economy, be an extremely unwise one. We in the West know the folly of transit duties, and I do not expect that we will ever have these in our country; but the levying of transit duties has been the universal experience among Oriental races, and if we have succeeded in putting down transit duties in India it has only been by friendly agreement with the
 1301 1302
*(8.1.)  GENERAL SIR L. PELLY  (Hackney, N.) : I wholly deprecate the intervention of this House as between a Commander-in-Chief and the administration of the Army under his command; and I agree with the hon. Baronet who spoke just now, that everything depends upon having efficient officers commanding regiments. The regiment is the unit of the Service, and I would be the last to say one word as intervening between General Sir Frederick Roberts and any officer commanding a regiment. But there ape two points to be considered. One is that Sir Frederick Roberts is alleged to have erred in supposing that he twice inspected this regiment, and I think he would desire to correct that error if he has made it; secondly, is it right that an officer with such a record as Colonel Jackson should be removed not only from the command of a Cavalry regiment, but from the Service altogether, under such circumstances? I have known this officer many years.
 1319
*(5.38.)  SIR R. TEMPLE  (Worcester, Evesham) : The Motion is limited to the extension of the railway to Candahar—that means from the mouth of the tunnel, through the Khwaja Amran range at Chaman on the British border in Pushin, to Candahar. Between the mouth of the tunnel and Candahar there are about 70 miles of flat country. Though I do not rise to support the Motion, yet I wish to speak of it sympa thetically. I know every inch of the ground over which it is proposed to extend the line. In 1879 I made a rough survey of that section of the railway to Candahar, or it was made by my officers under my supervision. The line is extremely easy to make, and it could have been made well in the year 1880–1. In fact, if my memory serves me rightly, I submitted proposals in 1879, under instructions from the Viceroy of India, whereby the first engine might enter Candahar by May, 1882. But a General Election came in 1880, and with that a change of Government, and a change of policy and opinion. The railway hung fire for a short time—that is, the entire railway project from the Indus Valley to Candahar. But soon afterwards it was re sumed, and as far as the range of mountains near Chaman it was completed, and instead of making a circuit to skirt the mountains, ray anticipations were exceeded by the making of the tunnel. Thus England has completed a great enterprise indeed; moreover, it will be a grand factor in the policy of the future. Now, my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham proposes the prolongation of the line from the end of the tunnel to Candahar, a distance of 70 to 80 miles, according to our original design, for military, financial, commercial, and in dustrial purposes. I quite admit this is a project of great consequence. But when I first proposed it we were in occupation of Candahar, whereas we have now retired. The case is in the

 SIR R. TEMPLE : I have known Colonel Jackson in former days, when he was in command of a force marching through a mountainous and difficult country, and I am quite satisfied that at
 1318
*(10.55.)  SIR R. TEMPLE  (Worcester, Evesham) : In the first place, I should like to point out to the Committee that when the hon. Member for Flintshire produced the extraordinary document which appeared to compel a licensee to sell a certain quantity of opium, the manner in which he read it out conveyed a wholly erroneous impression. Of course, nothing could have been farther from the hon. Member's intention than to misrepresent the facts, but, nevertheless, he unconsciously did so. This form of licence is in use only in particular districts on the frontiers of certain Native States, over which considerable quantities of the drug are smuggled. The object of inserting in the licence provisions as to the licensee taking a certain quantity of duly taxed and licensed opium is to prevent his obtaining and selling smuggled opium, and to put a check on this unlawful traffic. It is not intended to force the consumption of the drug; but if the licensee is compelled to buy a given quantity of lawful, he will be the best agent for the prevention of smuggling. The fact is, that the consumption of opium in British India has always been extremely limited. I entirely concur in what has fallen from the hon. Member for Flintshire as to irrigation. "Irrigate, irrigate, irrigate," should be the policy of Indian administration, and I contend that hitherto we have done our duty in that respect. Our irrigation works in India are the grandest to be found in any country or in any age in the world. We are now spending about £3,000,000 annually on public works—that is, on railways and canals—the money for which is mostly raised in India itself in order to avoid the difficulty of the exchange. The only portion of it raised in England is for materials, which must necessarily be obtained in this country.

 *SIR R. TEMPLE : May I interrupt the hon. Member for one moment? I have always said so, both in this House and elsewhere.
 *SIR ROPER LETHBRIDGE : I will leave that part of the question, and I will merely venture to indicate the connection that I was endeavouring to draw between the general extension of the railways of India and the Motion before the House. I will net pursue that branch of the subject further, except to say that Sir Arthur Cotton's opinion entirely justifies the views put forward by my hon. Friend as to the extraordinarily gratifying results that ensue from railway extension. As soon as a railway is constructed in India trade follows, the land is tilled, the population increases largely, and that would happen, I venture respectfully to suggest to the House, in this particular extension to Candahar, just as it happens in India itself. I rose to second the Motion, not so much from the military as from the commercial point of view. I

*(5.30.)  SIR ROPER LETHBRIDGE  (Kensington, N.) : I rise to second the Motion of my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, and I think both India and England are grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing this question before the House, and for pressing it very seriously upon the attention of Her Majesty's Government. I do not quite agree with some of the remarks in which my hon. Friend has indulged with regard
 1288 1289 1290
 SIR W. LAWSON  (Cumberland, Cockermouth) : At whose discretion was the flogging administered?
(12.0.)  THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (Sir W. HART DYKE,  Kent, Dartford : This is an important point. The Act will come into operation
 1363
 SIR W. PLOWDEN  (Wolverhampton, W.) : I hope Her Majesty's Government will not hastily endorse a decision that must necessarily entail upon Colonel Jackson a heavy pecuniary loss. I may venture to suggest whether the Government may not very well be appealed to to reconsider their decision in this matter, and to consider whether, in removing this officer from a position which he may not be competent to fill, they ought to inflict further punishment upon him by removing him from the Service.
 VISCOUNT CRANBORNE : If you will allow me to explain, Sir. I was not going to make any comments upon the Bill; only I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman to use his influence to have the Act ready for issue as soon as the printer can print it. It is a complicated measure; it has undergone many changes which it has not always been possible for school managers to follow. As I am not in order, I will not do more than offer this for consideration.
(11.54.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE  (Lancashire, N.E., Darwen) : I should like to take this, the last opportunity that will be offered, to make an appeal to the Government in respect to this Bill. The right hon. Gentleman is aware that the Bill has undergone several changes—
(11.57.)  VISCOUNT CRANBORNE : No doubt the clause now before the House, though, perhaps, it does not grant everything we hoped for, is an important clause, and I am glad the right hon. Gentleman assents to it. May I now say that which I was about to say just now by way of appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer—and this is the last opportunity for doing so. Will the right hon. Gentleman use his influence with a view to having this Act—as it soon will be—placed before the country in a complete form without delay? As he is aware, the time is very short, and school managers will have to make their arrangements under the new scheme within a very brief period. The Bill has gone through many changes, of which this is the last—
*(7.15.)  VISCOUNT BARING  (Bedfordshire, Biggleswade) : I rise to support the case presented by my hon. and gallant Friend, and I do so with some reluctance, because I regret the growing practice of making this House a Court of Appeal on military matters involving questions of discipline. But, Sir, Colonel Jackson has been treated so harshly in this case in India and so hardly in this country that I think my hon. and gallant Friend was perfectly justified in bringing the matter before the House. As my hon. and gallant Friend has said, Colonel Jackson is an officer who distinguished himself very much in two campaigns; he has been thanked in Despatches, he has served on the Staff of Governors General, he has been employed specially in matters requiring great tact and great temper, and his superior officers have always been satisfied with the way in which he carried out the duties entrusted to him. After that he commanded the body-guard, and then went back to his regiment to serve some two years as second in command of the 12th Bengal Cavalry, and during that time he performed his duties satisfactorily, and Sir Frederick Roberts formed such a high opinion of his capacity that he selected him as being the officer to take command of the 5th Bengal Cavalry, which at that time was in a not very efficient state. Six months after Colonel Jackson had been in command of the 5th Bengal Cavalry that regiment was inspected by Sir Hugh Gough, who gave a very satisfactory Report upon the regiment. That was the result of six months' trial of Colonel Jackson in command of the regiment. Then there comes upon the scene General Luck, of whom I also wish to speak with every respect, because we know there is no smarter Cavalry officer in the Service. Well, unfortunately, General Luck's first Report is extremely adverse to Colonel Jackson, and on the 31st March, 1888, General Luck, in his Report, stated that
 1312 "Colonel Jackson wants dash; that he is deficient in tact, manner, temper, and judgment." 1313 1314 1315
*(8.7.)  VISCOUNT BARING : I wish to ask the Under Secretary whether he will produce the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Viceroy,
 1320
 SIR J. GORST : At this period of the Session it is impossible to give an answer to a hypothetical question of this nature, but I may inform the hon. Gentleman that the case of Captain Chatterton extends as far back as the year 1869, and has been repeatedly considered by successive Governments. No injustice has been done to that officer.
 SIR J. GORST : No case could have been considered more fully. It is quite impossible to consider it again.
 THE LORD CHANCELLOR said :  My Lords and Gentlemen,
 MR. SPEAKER : It is certainly not regular to discuss the question now, although it might have been if there had been a Bill before the House.
 MR. SPEAKER : I am sorry the hon. Gentleman is under a misconception. I can assure him that last night I called upon him and he made no response. I sat down. I then rose again, and again looked at the hon. Gentleman, thinking that he was going to move the Resolution which stood on the Paper in his name.
 MR. SPEAKER : I am sorry if I have been under a complete misconception as to the intention of the hon. Gentleman. If he says he intended to move it I must accept his statement. But I then went on to the next Motion, the hon. Gentleman never having moved.
 MR. SPEAKER : I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I, and the Clerks at the Table, like myself, were under the impression that he had waived his right.
 MR. SPEAKER : I am sorry, then, if there has been any misconception on my part. But when the hon. Gentleman asks the House to be good enough to expunge the record of the proceedings the other night, let me remind him that when I proceeded to ask the hon. Gentleman to stand up in his place I was acting under the Standing Order which is intended to save the House the trouble of dividing when there is a very small minority. The Order under
 1375
 MR. SPEAKER : On the first day of next Session the hon. Member may give notice that he will bring it forward.
 * THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : The hon. Member is quite mistaken upon one point, inasmuch as the Bill to which he refers was read a second time and referred to a Select Committee.
 *MR. RITCHIE : I can only repeat that the hon. Member is quite mistaken, and that the Bill was read a second time and referred to the Committee on the other Bills referring to the London water supply. The Government consented to the Second Reading of the Bill.
 *THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. RITCHIE,  Tower Hamlets, St. George's) : It is impossible to ask the House of Lords to consider the Bill now, as they have adjourned, and will not meet again, except for the reading of the Speech from the Throne. It is true, as the hon. Member for Boston has said, the noble Lord at the head of the Government has expressed approval of the principle of
 1392
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND (Mr. MADDEN,  Dublin University) : The General Prisons Board report that the date of the circular calling attention to the order referred to of 1879 was the 8th of April, 1889. This second circular was issued because cases were brought under the notice of
 1378
 MR. MADDEN : I have called for a Report upon the case, but the time which has elapsed since notice was given has not permitted me to receive it.
 MR. KNOX  (Cavan, W.) : I beg to ask the Attorney General for Ireland whether his attention has been drawn to an assault alleged to have been committed on the occasion of a recent Poor Law election by Mr. James William. Montgomery, of Borim, near Swanlibar, County Cavan, upon two children named McGoldrick, aged ten and eight respectively; and whether Mr. Montgomery will be prosecuted?
 * MR. DE LISLE  (Leicestershire, Mid.) : I would wish to add my appeal to the hon. Member not to press the Bill. I not only opposed the Second Reading, but it will be my duty to oppose the measure in all its stages. Under these circumstances, my hon. Friend must see that it is impossible to proceed with a Bill which will require very careful handling in Committee to make it acceptable even to those who voted for the Second Reading.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : I think the hon. Gentleman is in error. The gentleman referred to was qualified to act as a medical practitioner both in England and in France Special inquiries have been made in regard to the matter, and it was found that the gentleman referred to is a member of the College of Surgeons and also a licentiate of the College of Physicians.
 MR. GOSCHEN : We cannot do that.
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Mr. GOSCHEN,  St. George's, Hanover Square) : May I be permitted to say that it would be impossible, even with every desire to meet the views of the hon. Gentleman, to proceed without notice to expunge these Resolutions? Even if it should be the wish of the House to expunge them, it would be impossible to take that course now. No reflection was intended by me, or, I am sure, by any single Member of the House in the action taken under the Rules of the House, and I hope that the hon. Member will accept that assurance.
 MR. ATKINSON : Mr. Speaker, I have given notice every day since I came back to the House, and, therefore, the contention of the right hon. Gentleman,
 1376
 MR. ATKINSON : Can I give notice that on the first day of next Session I will move my Resolution? I have not done so to-day, because I hoped my present leader would have been generous enough to have dealt with the matter now.
 MR. ATKINSON : Then I will bring it forward on the first day of the Session.
 MR. ATKINSON : Very well, Sir.
 MR. ATKINSON : No.
 MR. ATKINSON : I thought I moved by bowing twice.
 MR. ATKINSON : I did bow twice.
 MR. ATKINSON : May I move a Resolution that Mr. De Cobain should now be expelled?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : May I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he is aware that the certificate in reference to the matter of Mr. De Cobain was signed by a gentleman who was not qualified by law as a medical practitioner?
 MR. ATKINSON  (Boston) : I avail myself, Mr. Speaker, of your permission and the kindness of the House to make a personal statement. I know that the House always wishes to be just and generous, and therefore I wish to say that to-day, when I looked at the report of the proceedings in my bedrooom at 8 o'clock, I found that a Motion that I moved last night was not on the Paper as not having been dealt with, or on the Paper as having been dealt with. I came here immediately in order to make an inquiry, and I found that to some extent technically I was wrong. I have been told by Mr. Palgrave, who has been kind enough to talk the matter over with me, that when I went and sat
 1372 "1, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., Aug. 5, 1891, 8 a.m. To the Clerks at the Table, House of Commons. Gentlemen,—Last night when my 'Notice of Motion' was called by the Right Hon. the Speaker, saying, 'Mr. Atkinson,' I stood up in my place at the end of second Bench (just behind the Front Bench), and I bowed to the Chair and towards Mr. Palgrave, who was reading. I
 1373 "No one objected to my action, but I do not see any record of it. May I ask why? I write this because I do not wish to lose any result of my action. I therefore beg you to bring this letter before the right hon. Gentleman the Speaker. You must have seen me rise and bow. I do not wish unnecessarily to trouble the House this morning, so I ask you (by the hands of my son, who acts as my private secretary and waits for your reply) what is my position? I wish to lose no chance of carrying the Resolution in question, which is at page 7 and runs thus:—'Mr. Atkinson.—Entries in Votes and Proceedings, 24th and 27th July, 1891. That the notice as to the suspension of Henry John Atkinson, M.P. for Boston, and the notice as to frivolous divisions upon which the suspension is based be immediately expunged from all the records of the House of Commons.' After this morning I may be too late for months. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, HENRY JOHN ATKINSON. P.S.—I will come to you at once if wished. I had already stated to the House I would take every opportunity in every Bill or Resolution to get the records against me expunged (see reports of my remarks on Monday)…I see there is no such notice in to-day's paper. This, therefore, proves what I say—my notice quoted above was dealt with, but is not recorded." 1374
 MR. ATKINSON : In reply to the last speaker, I may mention that I received a letter from a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, to which the hon. Gentleman belongs, declaring that the hon. Gentleman does not represent
 1393
 MR. ATKINSON : The last time I saw the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton he informed me that he intended to wash his hands of the measure altogether. I do not see why the Committee should expect me to wait until the right hon. Gentleman has washed his hands so long as to be able to go on with the Bill. The Bill has been accepted by both sides of the House, and its Second Reading has been carried without a dissentient vote. It is a Bill that tends to religious equality by dispensing with the attendance of a lawyer's clerk at Nonconformist marriages. It is brought in in the interests of my co-religionists—the Wesleyan Methodists—and is supported by hon. Members opposite, who have been stumping Cornwall and other parts of the country with me. I have brought this measure forward every Session for the last six years, and I hold in my hand letters from Lord Salisbury expressing his high approval of the measure, and requesting me to press it forward. We have a special claim on our leaders, if they can lead at all, to lead us in the direction of giving us this boon.
 MR. ATKINSON : No, no!
 MR. ATKINSON : I will not detain the House two minutes, for I am not an authority on Indian affairs, and I think that some of those who stand up opposite to speak on them have as little authority as myself. But I do sometimes read matter which is sent to me for perusal. I have read matter sent to me by Committees in which hon. Gentlemen opposite are interested, and my study of it has led me to the conclusion that if those hon. Gentlemen, or those they represent, would refrain from stumping India, and from telling the Radical people there that they are badly treated, we should have a better opportunity—as the Under Secretary for India has said—of doing good for the people of India. The fact is, that all those who wish to do a good stroke, as they think, for Radicalism, think that not only ought they to do it in every part of England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, but that, when they have done it there, they should detach some of their regular forces, and do it in India, too. We know that India is not fit for this sort of thing. We know that in the Empire of Russia they tried to adopt English institutions—they tried to establish Justices of the Peace—but the whole thing was a total failure. So it is in India. Therefore, I support what Her Majesty's Government have said, and I hope we shall have less of this stumping India by discontented ex-Viceroys or anybody else.
 MR. ATKINSON : I beg to suggest that, in considering the Bill, we should be much better employed than in walking about losing time between now and the Prorogation. I have made every alteration that is necessary in the Bill to meet the views of the Attorney General. I have provided for the protection of the interests of Registrars; I have altered the fees in a manner that is satisfactory. I have conceded every necessary alteration to the critics of the Bill, and I would urge its supporters not to be flouted when there is ample time to pass it.
 MR. CALDWELL : I would suggest to the hon. Member that he should take advantage of the discussion which has taken place to produce next Session a Bill that will meet with general acceptance. The feeling of the House is in favour of the measure, but the real question is the question of how to work it out. In the meantime, I think we must feel that we shall lose our time by going into Committee.
(11.15.)  MR. CALDWELL  (Glasgow, St. Rollox) : I have no doubt that this is a very good Bill; but, at the same time, we must look at this matter from a practical point of view. It is evident that the measure cannot be passed this Session. It has to go through this House and then through the House of Lords. Whatever time, therefore, we devote to the consideration of the Bill to-day will practically be lost.
 MR. KELLY  (Camberwell, N.) : I would appeal to my hon. Friend the Member for Boston to withdraw the Bill. The Government have promised that no contentious business shall be taken; and if the hon. Gentleman persists in the course he is now pursuing, he will be prejudicing one of the best measures which has ever been before the House. I am strongly in favour of the measure; but, as many hon. Members have left the House in the belief that no contentious business would be taken, I would strongly urge the hon. Member, in his own interest and that of the Bill, not to persevere with the measure.
 COLONEL NOLAN : The President of the Local Government Board has absolutely proved my case. I thought that, as the Appropriation Bill had only just passed this House, the clerks would be preparing it for the House of Lords; but what is my astonishment to find that it has already passed through all its stages in the House of Lords, and that their Lordships adjourned some minutes ago! It would be possible for the House of Lords to do the same thing before the Prorogation with this Bill. They could pass it in a couple of minutes.
 COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I wish to endorse the suggestion that next Session the Government should take a day a week for Supply at the beginning of the Session [Mr. JACKSON: We did it this Session.] Yes, but there were Motions on going into Committee, and the Government allowed the House to be counted out. From a business point of view nothing can be more disgraceful than the way the Government got the money on Friday night—the reckless way in which the work of the Committee was done. Up to 1 o'clock over £5,000,000 were voted, and then, when all were tired out, and there could he no real discussion, the Committee voted between £15,000,000 and £20,000,000 more. That is the way in which about one-half of the Estimates have been voted this year. ["Agreed, agreed!"] It is all very well for hon. Members opposite to cry out "agreed." I confess that I do not like this innovation of 10 o'clock Sittings. I am afraid that it may form a rather dangerous precedent. The Government can easily arrange with their supporters to come down, but it cannot be expected that the Opposition should attend. Before the Session breaks up, I should like to remind the Government that they have in hand £200,000 which should properly be devoted to Irish labourers and teachers; and during the Recess no doubt all sorts of doctrinaire schemes will be submitted for disposing
 1384
(11.20.)  COLONEL NOLAN  (Galway, N.) : I do not see why the House of Commons should not pass the Bill through all its stages, and send it to the House of Lords, who can take a course similar to that which they are about to bake with the Appropriation Bill, and pass the measure through all its stages.
(11.28.)  MR. J. O'CONNOR  (Tipperary, S.) : As a Roman Catholic, not repudiated yet, at all events, by his ecclesiastical superiors, I must say I think that my co-religionists in Ireland would be insulted if an attorney's clerk were brought in to act as Registrar of Marriages. In Ireland the priests do that. I intend, however, to support the Motion for Progress, and I do not want to be misunderstood in doing so. The hon. Member for Boston says he wishes to avail himself of this opportunity to press his measure, but I understand from the Government that there is no such opportunity. The "opportunity" does not exist, and in forcing the Bill through on such a day as this we shall be killing time in a contentious sort of way, but we shall not be advancing the measure the right hon. Gentleman has at heart. I would appeal to the hon. Member again to take the sensible advice of the hon. Member for the St. Rollox Division, and withdraw the Bill now and bring it forward next Session.
 MR. P. O'BRIEN  (Monaghan, N.) : I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he will inquire if it was in 1888 that the order made in 1879 requiring that prison officers should wear uniform off duty was enforced; and, if so, what special circumstances called for its enforcement at that particular time; what steps have the Prisons Board taken to inform themselves of the feeling of the officers; will he advise the Prisons Board to take the opinion of the officers of all ranks as to whether they consider the wearing of uniform off duty as a grievance which exposes them to assault and insult, and cause the Board at the same time to inform the officers that they will be free to express their opinion on the question without fear of being fined or otherwise punished by the Board; and whether, if it is found that a majority of the officers desire to be free, as English prison officers are, to wear civilian's dress off duty, they will be free to do so?
 * MR. W. M'LAREN  (Cheshire, Crewe) : I will not detain the House for more than one or two minutes; but I wish to know from the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for India whether he can give the House some definite assurance with regard to the Indian Councils Bill next year? It has been a matter of great regret to many Members of the House, and, I believe, to a large number of persons in India, that that Bill has not been proceeded with this Session. This is the third Session in which a Bill substantially of the same character has been before the House. It is perfectly true that the measure did not meet with the approval of some hon. Members. Among others, the late Mr. Bradlaugh, who took a great interest in Indian questions, and whose death we all lament, was strongly opposed to the Bill, and I myself took the liberty of putting down a Motion on the Second Reading with regard to the adoption of the elective principle in the measure. It was desired to extend the scope of the Bill; but although the opposition which was offered may have; postponed the progress of the measure, nothing can mitigate our regret that the Bill has not been discussed during the
 1385 1386
(11.11.)  MR. M'LAREN : I beg to move to report Progress, on the ground that it is absolutely impossible for the measure to become law this Session. There are eight pages of Amendments-to it in the names of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton and the Attorney General. It is so full of contentious matter that it cannot be-passed this day, and even if it passed this House it could not pass the other House also. We should, therefore, only waste time by going into Committee on the Bill.
 * MR. M'LAREN : Perhaps, with the permission of the House, I may say this—the right hon. Gentleman would not wish that anything he said should be open to misunderstanding.
 1389
 MR. JACKSON : No, Sir; I do not say anything of the kind. What I said was that I thought the hon. Gentleman was wrong. I hope I have made it clear to the hon. Member that money voted for one Vote cannot be applied to any other Vote, but money voted under one sub-head of a particular Vote can be properly expended under another subhead of the same Vote. Money voted under one Vote cannot be transferred to another Vote. That is not possible, and in this case the hon. Member may rest satisfied that the money voted will be properly applied. There are many precedents where, on the taking of a Vote, the Minister in charge, as in this case, has made a statement to the House stating the intention to apply an unexpended balance to some other purpose connected with the same Vote. The House was fully apprised of the intention of the Government to appropriate the surplus.
 *MR. JACKSON : They would not be able to consider the Amendments at all.
 THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. JACKSON,  Leeds, N.) : I think the hon. Member may rest assured that no money will be spent except with proper legal authority. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will keep a very sharp eye upon the expenditure of public money, and I think that Parliament may rely upon the watch-
 1380
 MR. JACKSON : I think the hon. Member wrongly understood what the right hon. Gentleman said. It is true that in the Civil Service Estimates money voted in one Vote cannot be applied to purposes connected with another Vote, but it is also true that within the Vote itself money voted under one sub-head or the savings under one sub-head may be applied with the sanction of the Treasury to purposes connected with another subhead.
 SIR A. ROLLIT  (Islington, S.) : I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, but I feel that, under existing circumstances, there is no alternative but to vote for reporting Progress.
 *MR. MORTON : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman why he did not make this explanation in reply to the statement of the Chairman of Ways and Means in Committee of Supply?
 *MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I would also press upon the Government the necessity of allowing the House to discuss, at any rate, the provisions of the Bill which has been mentioned by my hon. Friend. I would further express a hope that the Government will, during the Recess, consider the wishes of the people of India in reference to the introduction of the elective principle into the Indian Councils. In my opinion, that is the only proper way of governing the people of India, and the only way in which any legislative measure connected with that country can be properly considered, having regard to the interests of the people of India. What I wish is that Her Majesty's Government, instead of making another Ireland of India, should consider this question in good time; and now that the people of India have to a large extent been educated, that they will take them into their confidence as far as possible. I would also ask the Government to endeavour to bring forward the Indian Budget at an earlier period next Session. Everyone knows that to bring it forward in the dog days, as was the case last night, is practically a farce. There were only a handful of Members here to consider it, although it affects the prosperity and well-being of some 200,000,000 or 300,000,000 of people. Every year attempts are made to dispose of Indian questions without adequate consideration and without proper debate. I have no desire to blame the right hon. Gentleman the Under Secretary for India, because I do not know that he has had anything to do with the matter, and we all know that he has a very poor opinion of the Government of India, and the way in which the people of India are treated.
 *MR. MORTON : I should be sorry to misrepresent the right hon. Gentleman, but I gathered that to be his opinion from a speech which he delivered not long ago, and it is certainly the
 1387
 *MR. MORTON : Then does the right hon. Gentleman say that the Chairman of Ways and Means was wrong?
 *MR. MORTON : I understood the Chairman of Ways and Means to say so.
 * MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : Before I finally part with this £32,000,000, I desire to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for an explanation upon what I think is a distinct grievance. We have been told that money voted in this House for a certain purpose cannot be spent for any other purpose. That assurance was distinctly given to us by the right hon. Gentleman the Chairman of Ways and Means; but I now understand from what occurred on Saturday in answer to a question to the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs that the Government do propose to take savings under the Diplomatic Vote and expend them for other purposes without the previous consent of Parliament. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be able to assure me that the law will be respected, and that no money voted for one purpose will be applied to another without the consent of Parliament. I am aware that sometimes this objectionable course has been taken in regard to the Naval and Military Votes, and that the Treasury have been allowed to appropriate unexpended money voted for one purpose and apply it to another, but it has never been the case in connection with the Civil Service Estimates, and I know of no power in regard to those Votes which allows the Treasury or anybody else to spend money for purposes not mentioned in the Vote. I want to have a distinct assurance from the right hon. Gentleman that this practice will not be followed in the future.
 MR. MORTON : Will the right hon. Gentleman consider the case in any way?
 MR. MORTON  (Peterborough) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether, if the Military Authority in Captain Chatterton's case was properly exercised on the 11th of March, 1869, to take effect on and after arrival in India, on the faith of the Report upon which he had been suspended from duty, such Military Authority was legally exercised on or about the 28th of April, 1869, namely, after his
 1377
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham) : As I told the noble Lord last night, it is impossible to answer this question without communicating with my noble Friend the Secretary of State for India. If the noble Lord will repeat the question next Session I have no doubt that I shall be able to answer it.
 * SIR J. GORST : I feel grateful to the hon. Member for giving me an opportunity of saying a word about the Indian Councils Bill. This Bill was brought in, as he has said, three Sessions ago. It was brought in in order to make good the pledge given by the Viceroy of India, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, that two small but not unimportant reforms should be made in the proceedings of the Council—that, in the first place, the right of interpolation in certain conditions should be given to members of the Council; and that, in the second place, they should have an opportunity of discussing the Indian Budget, although no change should take place in the taxation of the country. It was found, soon after this pledge was given, that it would be impossible to carry out what the Viceroy proposed without legislation, because the old Indian Councils Act, which was drawn apparently for the purpose of repressing discussion, was so stringent in its terms that these two reforms could not be carried out without an alteration in the law. Therefore, the Indian Councils Bill was brought in. At the same time a further reform was introduced in the Bill, which had not been made the subject of any definite pledge on the part of the Viceroy, and that was to increase somewhat the numbers both of the Viceroy's Council and the Councils in the various provinces. This Bill as it stood was a very small measure. It was a Bill which was to carry out a reform which everybody desired, to which the Government had given their assent, and which gentlemen who may be called "the Indian Congress Party" had repeatedly solicited, and there was nothing to prevent the people of India enjoying
 1388
 *SIR J. GORST : No; I tried to explain that I did not complain of their discussing the Bill, bat I did complain that they should take advantage of the Bill to introduce a much larger and more comprehensive measure. It was perfectly in order to do so in this House; but it had the effect of rendering the small reform projected by the Viceroy of India and Her Majesty's Government perfectly impossible.
 *THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (Sir J. GORST,  Chatham) : I never stated anything of the kind.
 * MR. CREMER  (Shoreditch, Haggerston) : Before the Bill passes its final stage, I wish to enter a protest against the way in which enormous
 1381 1382 Cries of
 *MR. CREMER : I know that the London Liberal Members complained of the course the Government pursued, but if I am mistaken I shall be glad to withdraw.
 *MR. CREMER : The fact that the Bill was read a second time and referred to the Water Committee escaped my memory, but practically I am right, for by referring the Bill to the Water Committee the Government shelved it for this Session, and the result will be that the householders of London will have to pay a heavy penalty in increased charges for water.
 VISCOUNT BARING  (Bedfordshire, Biggleswade) : I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State for India whether in a telegram sent by the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy in March or April, 1891 (which telegram was recently referred to by Lord Cross), the following words, or words to that effect, were used, namely:—
 "Am not satisfied with propriety of retiring Jackson. Strong feeling here that he has been hardly dealt with. Would your Government consent to give him another trial as originally intended by the Commander-in-Chief, for there can be no doubt that he came home under a misapprehension"?
